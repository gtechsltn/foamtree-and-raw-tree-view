The application sought review of certain decisions attributed to the Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink and the Secretary of the Department of Human Services or their delegates. Three of the decisions related to the means by which Ms Luck would be permitted to have access to Centrelink in order to deal with her affairs. The decisions were identified as: Each of these decisions was said to have been made under the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency Act 1997 (Cth), the Public Service Act 1999 (Cth), the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971 (Cth) and \"Social Security Law\". No specific provisions of these enactments were identified. Ms Luck also sought to review the conduct of the respondents in relation to the making of these three decisions. She also sought to challenge what she described as the failure of the respondents to make a decision to review the decision of an Area Manager, said to have been made on 10 August 2007, the second of the two decisions identified above, review of which was said to have been sought by the then Chief Executive Officer of Centrelink, on 3 October 2007. The respondents filed a notice of objection to the competency of the application insofar as it sought review of the decisions made on 31 July 2006 and 10 August 2007, the alleged failure to review the 10 August 2007 decision, and the conduct relating to the making of those decisions. The objection was founded on the time limits imposed on the commencement of proceedings under the ADJR Act by s 11(3) of that Act. The notice of objection to competency was filed on 3 July 2008. The second respondent sought an order that she be removed as a respondent on the ground that neither she nor any delegate of hers had made or could make any of the impugned decisions. On 4 July 2008 I ordered that the first respondent file and serve contentions of fact and law in support of his objections to the competency of the application and that the second respondent file and serve contentions of fact and law in support of a separate application that she be removed as a party. These contentions were filed in accordance with the directions. I adjourned the further hearing of the application to 20 August 2008. On 20 August 2008 Ms Luck failed to appear when the matter was called on for further hearing. In her absence I ordered that she file and serve any submissions in response to the respondents' submissions on or before 26 September 2008. Ms Luck did not file any submissions prior to 26 September 2008. She had not done so by 15 October 2008, the day fixed for the hearing of the respondents' preliminary objections. On 15 October 2008 Ms Luck sought a further adjournment of the hearing of the proceeding and an extension of time within which to file and serve her submissions. The applications were not opposed. I acceded to her applications and adjourned the matter for hearing today. In the meantime Ms Luck has filed written submissions. Section 11(3) of the ADJR Act required that Ms Luck lodge any application which sought to impugn the decisions made in July 2006 and August 2007 and the conduct of the respondents in the making of these decisions within 28 days of her being notified in writing of the decisions. The same time limit applied to the alleged failure of the respondents to make a decision in respect of her request for review in October 2007. Ms Luck failed to make timely applications in relation to these decisions, the conduct or the alleged failure to make a decision. She attributes this failure to a lack of knowledge of the legal requirements and her poor health. She contends that the respondents would suffer no prejudice were the objection to competency be dismissed. The Court has discretion to enlarge the time within which an application may be lodged notwithstanding the fact that the prescribed time limit has expired: see s 11(1)(c) of the ADJR Act. Ms Luck has not sought, on notice, an order enlarging time in respect of the decisions and conduct to which the objections to competency relate. She submitted that she had, in substance, made such an application in an affidavit sworn in support of her application. The respondents did not object to me treating the application as having been regularly made and considering it. It is, therefore, convenient to deal with both the objections to competency and the application for enlargement of time together. If Ms Luck is successful and an extension of time is granted then the foundation of the objections to competency will fall away. When an application for an extension of time to commence a proceeding under the ADJR Act is made the Court has an unfettered discretion. There is a large number of potentially relevant considerations which, depending upon the circumstances, may need to be balanced in determining how the discretion should be exercised. Many of these were collected by Wilcox J in his judgment in Hunter Valley Developments Pty Ltd v Cohen [1984] FCA 176 ; (1984) 3 FCR 344 at 348-9. I am prepared to assume, in Ms Luck's favour that she did not make timely applications because of ignorance of her legal rights and because of health problems. She has also been occupied with a good deal of litigation in this Court and elsewhere. I am also prepared to assume that the respondents would suffer no prejudice were an extension of time to be granted. On the other hand, it is necessary to have regard to the considerable delay involved and the merits of the principal application. The factor which, however, weighs most heavily against the granting of an extension of time is that the two decisions which are the subject of the objections to competency were both expressed to be operative for only twelve months and three months respectively. Their effect is spent. Any attempt to deal with the alleged failure to make a decision to review the second decision would, for the same reason, serve no useful purpose. No useful purpose would be served at this stage by quashing these decisions or declaring them to be null and void. The June 2008 decision, in respect of which a timely application was made, was in substantially the same terms as the two spent decisions. Ms Luck relies on the same grounds to challenge all three decisions. She will not, therefore, be deprived of the opportunity of testing the legal validity of the restrictions placed on her in relation to her dealings with Centrelink. Ms Luck's application for an enlargement of time should be dismissed. The respondents' objection to competency should be upheld. I have been unable to identify any provision in any of the Acts to which Ms Luck referred in her application which empowered the second respondent or any of her delegates to make any of the impugned decisions. Nor is there any evidence that the second respondent or a delegate of the second respondent had, in fact, made any of the impugned decisions. She is not a necessary party to the proceeding and she should be removed as a party. I will so order. In the course of submissions this morning, Ms Luck applied orally for an order that the Commonwealth of Australia be joined as a party respondent to the proceeding. When asked to identify the reasons why it was she sought such an order she submitted that the Commonwealth was what she described as the \"over-riding authority\". She said further that the Commonwealth was ultimately responsible for the events about which she complained. She said further that she had evidence that Ministers had been involved in relevant decision making. She did not tell the Court what the evidence was, nor was there any affidavit material to support such a claim. In my view no adequate reasons have been advanced to support Ms Luck's application to join the Commonwealth as a respondent. The application will be refused. I will hear the parties on the form of orders which should be made to give effect to the reasons and to facilitate the trial of the application insofar as it has survived the respondents' objections to competency.

The Settlement Sum, as described in the Further Terms of Settlement, be distributed in accordance with the Further Terms of Settlement. Sue Youngsook Lee is removed from the list of Group Members as defined in the Further Amended Statement of Claim and Further Amended Application. Pursuant to s 33ZB(a) of the Federal Court Act the Court declares that the persons affected and bound by these orders are the applicants, the respondent, and the group members who are defined in the Further Amended Statement of Claim. All costs orders made to date in the proceeding are hereby vacated. There will be no order as to costs of the proceedings. The Applicants file an affidavit upon the receipt of the Settlement Sum in accordance with the Terms of Settlement and Further Terms of Settlement. Upon the filing of that affidavit, the Further Amended Application filed on 22 February 2008 be dismissed. In the principal proceeding, the application is brought by the applicants as a representative party on behalf of 102 group members although some of those group members represent more than one individual or corporation. By the Further Amended Application and the Further Amended Statement of Claim, the applicants claim relief said to arise out of conduct on the part of the respondent involving negligence; negligent misstatement; contraventions of ss 912A , 945A , 1012A and 1041H of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the \" Corporations Act \"); contraventions of s 12DA of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the \"ASIC Act\"); and contraventions of s 851 of the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth), in connection with the investment by the group members as clients of the respondent, in four financial products issued by Westpoint Corporation Pty Ltd or entities related to that corporation. The financial products were promissory notes described as Market Street Mezzanine Finance Promissory Notes, Ann Street Mezzanine Finance Promissory Notes, Bayshore Mezzanine Finance Promissory Notes and York Street Mezzanine Finance Promissory Notes. The claims have been the subject of a mediation between the applicants and the respondents sponsored by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. That mediation resulted in the parties entering into the Terms of Settlement document of 19 June 2009 and Further Terms of Settlement. Under the Terms of Settlement document of 19 June 2009 the parties agree to distribute a settlement fund of $5,976,426.00 in full satisfaction of the claims of the group members which would provide for a return of 62.5 cents in the dollar in respect of each claimant's investment. Ms Sue Youngsook Lee was inadvertently included within the claim group. She was not an investor in any of the above Westpoint products. By order, she was removed from the class of group members. The group members now consist of 101 group members. Total claims constitute $9,512,281.27. Consistent with the Further Terms of Settlement, having regard to the removal of Ms Lee's claim, an amount of $5,945,176.00 will be distributed to the group members. The rateable distribution of 62.5 cents will not alter. The applicants now seek the Court's approval pursuant to s 33V(1) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (the \"Act\") of the Terms of Settlement represented by the two Settlement Agreements. In considering that question, I have considered all of the affidavit material relied upon by the applicants in support of the sanction. I also considered the principles identified by Jacobson J in Taylor v Telstra Corporation Ltd [2007] FCA 2008 at [56] to [66]; the observations of Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) (2001) 180 ALR 459; Darwalla Milling Co Pty Ltd v F Hoffmann-Laroche Ltd (No. 2) (2007) 236 ALR 322 per Jessup J; and Vernon v Village Life Ltd [2009] FCA 516. The nine factor test described by Goldberg J in Williams v FAI Homes Security Pty Ltd (No. 4) as \"helpful in the Australian jurisdiction\" derives from a nine factor test adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the third circuit in Re General Motors Corp Pick-Up Truck Fuel Tank Products Liability Litigation 55 F 3d 768 at 785. There is some debate in the authorities about the emphasis to be given to the nine factor test in applying the essential test the Court must address. However, the essential question is whether the settlement is fair and reasonable having regard to the claims made by the group members who will be bound by the settlement in the context of the facts pleaded; the prospects of success in the principal proceeding; the likelihood of group members obtaining judgment for an amount significantly in excess of the settlement distribution; the likely duration and cost of proceedings; and the weaknesses, substantial or procedural, in the case advanced by the group members and whether the settlement sum falls within a realistic range of likely outcomes. The Court will also have regard to the terms of any advice received by group members from counsel as well as any expert advice in relation to the issues raised by the proceeding. The Court will not second-guess the advice of the applicants' advisers. The Court takes the advice into account in determining whether the settlement is fair and reasonable, that is to say, whether the agreed settlement falls within the range of fair and reasonable likely outcomes, taking everything into account. In that context, I have had the benefit of reading a joint opinion by Mr Graham Gibson QC, Mr Tom Sullivan SC and Ms Lisa Nichols on behalf of the applicants which examines thoroughly the merits of each of the causes of action advanced in the principal proceeding. Having regard to the material read in support of the application and the joint advice which, by reason of its confidentiality, has remained sealed, I am satisfied that the settlement is a fair and reasonable settlement of the claims made by the group members who will be bound by the settlement. Mr Bain QC appeared on behalf of the respondent and supports the proposed orders under s 33V(1) of the Act. Accordingly, I have made orders in terms of a draft initialled by me subject to typographical corrections by the applicants. The solicitors for the applicants will submit a revised corrected document to the Court to be issued reflecting the final form of the orders. I certify that the preceding nine (9) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood. Associate: Dated: 30 October 2009 Counsel for the Applicants: Mr G Gibson QC, Mr T Sullivan SC and Ms L Nichols Solicitor for the Applicants: Mr H Copley, Solicitor, Australian Securities & Investments Commission Counsel for the Respondent: Mr R Bain QC Solicitor for the Respondent: Deacons Lawyers Date of Hearing: 30 October 2009 Date of Judgment: 30 October 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1235.html","title":"09_1235.txt","id":"1"},{"snippet":"In Horizontal Falls Adventure Tours Pty Ltd (ACN 108 455 410) v Thomas (No 2) [2009] FCA 1084 (\"the judgment\") I dismissed the claim of the applicant. The applicant sought relief pursuant to Pt A para 7 of the application filed 13 May 2007. After delivering judgment I ordered the parties to file and serve separate submissions as to costs incurred in respect of hearings leading to the judgment. Except as provided by any other Act, the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court: s 43(2) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Two clear issues for determination arise from these submissions. They are: Whether costs should be reserved until the conclusion of the substantive proceedings; and In light of the concession of the applicant that costs should follow the event --- whether the respondents' costs should be awarded on a party-party basis or an indemnity basis. 1. Should costs be reserved? The applicant has submitted that costs should be reserved to the trial of the balance of the proceedings, when the Court will have a more extensive understanding of the parties' conduct, and will be able to form a more informed and balanced view of where costs should ultimately fall. In my view however there is no advantage to either the Court or the successful respondents in reserving costs until this time, nor circumstances justifying such an order. Following agreement of the parties, the Court had ordered that the claims of the applicant in Pt A para 7 of the application be heard and determined separately. The judgment constituted the Court's orders and reasoning in respect of these discrete claims. The discretion to be exercised by the Court in relation to these claims relates to matters relevant to these claims, and not to other parts of the substantive proceedings. Order 62 rule 3 provides as follows: (1) The Court may in any proceeding exercise its powers and discretions as to costs at any stage of the proceeding or after the conclusion of the proceeding. In Allstate Life Insurance Co and Ors v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (No 13) [1995] FCA 1459 , where the respondents had been successful in meeting appeals dealing with a discrete question and the Court had ordered that the appellants pay the respondents' costs of the appeals, Lockhart, Lindgren and Tamberlin JJ observed: [4] The proceeding has been set down for hearing commencing on 18 March 1996 and unless settled may subsist for a substantial time. The litigation is complex. It is unlikely that final judgment will be given until late 1996 or even later. The successful parties to the appeals before this Court will therefore, in the ordinary course of events, not recover their costs for a long time. [5] It would be wrong if the successful parties do not enjoy the fruits of their order for costs for such a long time. The parties entitled to the benefit of the order for costs which this Court has made in appeals from interlocutory orders should not be deprived of that benefit until the case has been finally disposed of. In my view similar principles apply in this case. The respondents, who were successful in respect of issues arising in relation to Pt A para 7 of the application, have incurred costs to which they are now entitled. The applicant's claims in the substantive proceedings will not be heard until early 2010. There is no justification for leaving a determination of costs arising from the separate hearing of Pt A para 7 of the application until that time. 2. Basis of costs award The respondents submit that they should both be entitled to an award of costs on an indemnity basis. Mr Troy Thomas In relation to Mr Troy Thomas, the applicant submits that there was no basis for a claim that Mr Thomas had incurred separate costs and in any case that an award of costs should not be on an indemnity basis. However the respondents submit that: It is well settled that the purpose of an order for costs is to indemnify or compensate the person in whose favour it is made, not to punish the person against whom it is made: Latoudis v Casey [1990] HCA 59 ; (1990) 170 CLR 534 , De Alwis v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 77. Although the usual rule is that costs be awarded against the unsuccessful party on a party-party basis, the Court has a discretion to award costs on an indemnity basis in appropriate cases: Colgate-Palmolive v Cussons [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 231-234. Circumstances where the Court may consider awarding costs on an indemnity basis include: While it was clear at the hearings of 11 June 2009 and 22 June 2009 that there was substantial identity of interest between the respondents, nonetheless I accept the submission of the respondents that Mr Troy Thomas incurred costs separately from Mr Rhys Thomas. Further, I consider that there is a sound basis for an order awarding Mr Troy Thomas his costs incurred in these proceedings on an indemnity basis. As I observed in the judgment, notwithstanding that Mr Troy Thomas was required to meet the proceedings, HFAT did not open a case against him, nor did HFAT produce evidence in support of its claims against him in terms of Pt A para 7. Indeed, the applicant conceded in its submissions that, given the state of the evidence, there was no sufficient basis for an order against Mr Troy Thomas in relation to this aspect of the application. I consider that the claims against Mr Troy Thomas in terms of Pt A para 7 were of the nature described in Colgate-Palmolive (1993) 46 FCR and InterTAN [2005] FCAFC 54 , namely allegations which ought never to have been made, and which had no chance of success. Taking this view, and particularly in light of the fact that Mr Troy Thomas was required to take steps to defend himself against the applicant's case including engaging legal representation, I consider that the case against Mr Troy Thomas exhibits special features justifying the Court exercising its discretion to order costs incurred by him to be paid on an indemnity basis. Mr Rhys Thomas It was clear throughout the proceedings that the applicant's primary case in respect of the removal of the booking records was against Mr Rhys Thomas. In relation to costs incurred by Mr Rhys Thomas however I do not consider an award of costs on an indemnity basis is warranted. I do not consider that the claim against Mr Rhys Thomas had no chance of success or was hopeless or groundless, nor do I consider that the case against him exhibited special features so as to warrant the Court exercising its discretion to award indemnity costs. I form this view because I consider that: I consider that the appropriate order is that the applicant pay costs incurred by Mr Rhys Thomas on a party-party basis.

These hearings related to cases which are the subject of mediation referrals by the Court to the National Native Title Tribunal (the Tribunal). The cases are in the Court's \"Provisional Docket\" which is the class of native title determination proceedings under mediation and not requiring imminent programming to trial. When it is thought appropriate to submit an application to closer judicial case management with a view to its progress to trial or other disposition, it is generally allocated out of the provisional docket to the \"Substantive\" docket of a judge designated for that purpose. 2 A chronic problem of delay has arisen in the mediation of native title determination applications in the various regions of Western Australia. The delays are largely due to limitations on both the human and financial resources available to carry out the necessary work. Those limitations affect representative bodies, the applicants they represent, unrepresented applicants, the State Government and other respondents. The greatest difficulties have been associated with the resolution of overlaps between native title determination applications and the preparation, by or on behalf of applicants, of materials sufficient to satisfy the State Government of the relationship with the area of land or waters under claim necessary to support a native title determination. The provision of so-called \"connection material\" typically involves the services of an anthropologist to research the particular claim group, its traditional laws and customs and the nature of the connection of the group to the land and waters in question under those traditional laws and customs. That work may involve the collation of research literature and extensive field investigations. The amount of time required is substantial and may extend for many months and sometimes in excess of a year. There is a limited number of suitably qualified anthropologists available to carry out such work. Preparation of connection material may also involve the collation of historical, archaeological and linguistic evidence. Under the current practice of the State Government of Western Australia, connection material, when submitted to it, is assessed by an expert engaged by the State. The process of assessment is outlined in a document published, in October 2004, by the Office of Native Title of the State of Western Australia entitled \"Guidelines for the Provision of Information in Support of Applications for a Determination of Native Title\". 3 The mediation of native title determination applications is primarily a matter for the Tribunal. That priority is reflected in ss 86A and 86B of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the Act). The role of the Tribunal in mediation was heightened by the amendments made to the Act in 1998. They introduced a far more detailed regime for the mediation of native title determination applications than had previously been the case. Every such application must be referred to the Tribunal for mediation unless the Court orders otherwise (ss 86B(1) and (2)). The role of the Tribunal is reinforced by the Federal Court's facility to request it to provide reports on the progress of any mediation (s 86E). That role covers the process of information exchange of which the provision of connection material to the State is an important element. 4 In Frazer v Western Australia [2003] FCA 351 ; (2003) 128 FCR 458 at 466 I observed that: 'The referral under s 86B is a referral to the NNTT and, in my opinion, it has the responsibility, pursuant to that referral, to undertake mediation of all aspects of the application relevant to the purposes defined in s 86A. This includes the development of detailed negotiation protocol, the exchange of information between the parties, the identification of issues to be resolved and times and venues of conferences under the Act in furtherance of the mediation process. In so doing it is quite legitimate that the NNTT and the parties have regard to the resource limitations and other practical constraints under which each of them must operate. It is appropriate that within a particular region timetables may be staggered to reflect priorities within that region. It is legitimate for the protocols and timetables developed to provide for bilateral negotiations between parties with a report back to the NNTT. However, timetables for such bilateral discussions are an element of the mediation process undertaken by the NNTT in the exercise of its statutory function and in respect of which it may be required to report to the Court. ' In that case it was made clear that the provision of connection evidence between applicants and State is neither outside nor antecedent to the mediation process but an aspect of it (at [27]). 5 Shortly prior to publishing the decision in Frazer I made orders in relation to the Pilbara and Geraldton regions providing for the development of mediation timetables. The form of orders was along the lines of those made in Frazer (at [33[). They required the preparation by the applicants, overlapping applicants and the State of a program setting out a timetable for the exchange of information and specific issues to be negotiated. It was also directed that there be a detailed timetable including proposed meeting dates and venues set in a regional context and an outline of a negotiating protocol to be adopted by the State and the applicant. The parties were told that they had to lodge a copy of the relevant programs at the Court. Absent any agreement on such a program in a particular application, the applicant and any other interested parties were required to show cause why the application should not be referred to a substantive docket judge. In both the Geraldton and Pilbara regional areas mediation protocols and timetables were established pursuant to the Court's orders and have not been adhered to. Maps are attached to these reasons showing the claims in the two regions and charts provided by the Tribunal of the progress and anticipated progress of existing mediation protocols. 6 Directions were given on 1 August 2006 that the representative body for the Geraldton and Pilbara regions, the Yamatji Land and Sea Council (Yamatji), provide a report at the adjourned directions hearing on the feasibility of a single connection report covering a number of applications in the area as a means of progressing their resolution. Those applications are Budina (WAD131/2004), Malgana (WAD6236/1998), Nanda (WAD6136/1998), Thudgari (WAD6212/1998) and Gnulli (WAD6161/1998). Tribunal proposals with respect to delays in mediation process 7 In its regional reports to the Court dated 18 and 15 December 2006, relating to the Geraldton and Pilbara regions respectively, the Tribunal has informed the Court of significant non-compliance with the mediation protocols agreed between the State and the representative body in each case. Of 16 applications in the Geraldton region, nine have current mediation protocols and six have not been complied with. Of the 24 applications in the Pilbara region, 17 have current mediation protocols. Ten of those have not been complied with. In each case the Tribunal has expressed the view that parties must adopt a more rigorous adherence to the protocols if applications in the region are to be resolved within reasonable timeframes. It submitted to the Court that if by the time of the next directions hearing parties are unable to comply with the timeframes agreed in the mediation protocols, the Court should consider replacing them with programming orders. The Tribunal has proposed draft orders for applications grouped according to subregions which it has defined within each of the regions. It submitted that the draft orders were intended to expedite the resolution of applications with a particular focus on overlaps. I am prepared to make orders in the terms proposed by the Tribunal on the basis that closer support and engagement by the Tribunal with the parties offers more promise for progress than reliance upon the existing mediation protocol. It is important, however, to note that those protocols should not be regarded as displaced by the orders which I propose to make. Tribunal proposals for directions in the Geraldton Region 8 The Tribunal's draft orders are intended to expedite the resolution of applications in the region with a particular focus on the resolution of overlaps. What it seeks to achieve through the draft orders are: 1. Greater utilisation of the Tribunal in the resolution of overlaps. 2. More intensive mediation of key strategic applications. 3. Increased commitment to adherence to mediation protocols. The Tribunal referred to what it considered to be the very slow rate of progress for the resolution of applications which do not overlap and are to be found in the central and northern portions of the Geraldton region. While it acknowledged the resource limitations affecting Yamatji, it suggested that more timely and efficient progress could be achieved through greater utilisation of the Tribunal's significant research assistance capabilities. These include: (i) Background collections of anthropological and historical writings and relevant ethnographic maps relating to claim areas and claim groups (public domain materials). (ii) Based on the background collections reports relating to: . European contact history for the claim area; . Customary Practices setting out indigenous cultural and ceremonial practices in the claim area; . an area identity report which describes the naming of groups within the area and language/tribal boundaries. (iii) comprehensive geo-enhanced databases electronically linking historical facts to maps. (iv) specific research projects related to a claim or claims; (v) independent assessment of connection materials. 9 The Tribunal also pointed to research reports which it has prepared and provided to Yamatji and the State and copies of which have been sent to the Court. These reports relate to: '. the Gnulli (WAD6161/98), Malgana (WAD6236/98) and Nanda (WAD6136/98) applications; and . the overlapping applications in the Southern Geraldton cluster ie Amangu (WAD6002/04); Hutt River (WAD6001/00); Naaguja Peoples (WAD 6194/98); Arnold Franks (WAD 6273/98); Taylor Group (WAD6006/01); Widi Binyardi (WAD286/04); Mullewa Wadjari (WAD6119/98); Widi Mob (WAD6193/98); Badimia (WAD6123/98) (to the extent of the overlap); Wadjari Yamatji (WAD6033/98) (to the extent of the overlap). ' The Tribunal has scheduled further research into the overlap between the Badimia and the Widi Mob applicants. That work is to commence in January 2007 and will require about two months to complete. 10 For the Northwest Geraldton subregion comprising Malgana, Gnulli, Budina, Thudgari and Nanda, the Tribunal proposes the following orders: '1. By 31 March, applicants (and/or their representatives) of the Gnulli (WAD6161/98), Malgana (WAD6236/98) and Nanda (WAD6136/98) attend meetings convened by the Tribunal to discuss the content and status of existing research materials covering their respective claim areas. 2. By 30 April 2007, the Tribunal, in consultation with [Yamatji], develop a program for the conduct of further necessary research in each of these matters and submit a copy to the Court. ' 11 The Southwest Geraldton subregion, as defined in the Tribunal's report, comprises the applications known as Hutt River, Naaguja, Amangu, Arnold Franks, Taylor Group, Widi Binyardi and Widi Mob. There are a number of overlaps between those applications and applications in the Central Geraldton subregion which comprises the Wadjari Yamatji, Mullewa Wadjari, Badimia, Yugunga-Nya, Widi Binyardi and Widi Mob. As appears, the Tribunal treats the Widi Binyardi and Widi Mob applications as falling into both sub-regions. 12 In relation to the Southwest Geraldton subregion and the Central Geraldton subregion there are some ten overlapping applications identified in a \"South Geraldton Cluster Overlap Chart\" which was Annexure A to the Tribunal's original report. These applications are Hutt River, Naaguja, Arnold Franks, Taylor Group, Widi Binyardi, Mullewa Wadjari, Widi Mob, Badimia, Wadjari Yamatji and Amangu. In respect of these applications the Tribunal proposed the following orders: '1. The representatives of the 10 applications listed in the Southwest Geraldton Cluster Chart ... attend meetings called by the [Tribunal] between January 1 and June 30 2007 for the purpose of resolving overlaps. 2. By January 30 2007, the Tribunal provide the Court with a timetable of meetings with all parties. 3. By March 31 2007, the Tribunal provide the Court with a progress report detailing the steps taken to resolve the overlaps. 4. By 31 March 2007, [Yamatji] and the State provide the Court with a program for the preparation and assessment of connection material for all claims in the southwest Geraldton area. 5. By March 31 2007, the Tribunal provide the Court with a progress report on the Tribunal research project examining the overlap area between Badimia (WAD6123/98) and Widi Mob (WAD6193/98). ' Yamatji Land and Sea Council response to Tribunal concerns and proposals for Geraldton region 13 By a letter to the Court dated 15 December 2006 Yamatji responded to the Tribunal's report in relation to Geraldton. The letter was signed by its Acting Principal Legal Officer. 14 According to Yamatji a number of significant matters have progressed during the reporting period despite significant difficulties experienced by it. Its Geraldton office has suffered from significant staff shortages directly affecting its capacity to go forward with the mediation programs. Two new legal officers were engaged in September 2006, although the employment of one was terminated in November 2006. Between July 2006 and September 2006 the Acting Principal Legal officer was the only legal officer in Yamatji's Geraldton office. In the period July to December 2006 Yamatji had a significantly reduced capacity to progress claims. 15 Submission of connection materials on priority claims was said to be progressing largely according to plan. The submission of final supplementary material to the State for the Thudgari connection report occurred in October 2006, and was within two weeks of the nominated timeframe. It is expected that the State's assessment will be completed in March 2007 and that negotiations will commence immediately thereafter. Yamatji also said that final connection material for the Badimia claim would be submitted by March 2007. This was an extension of one month over the date previously agreed. It had instructions to organise a mediation meeting between the Badimia and Widi Mob applicants. A meeting was set for 19 October 2006. However, that meeting was postponed to allow the Tribunal to meet with the Widi Mob applicant, Mrs Martin, and to conduct research in relation to her asserted connection. The meeting was rescheduled to occur early in 2007 once the research had been completed. According to the Yamatji report regular group meetings for all claim groups in the region occurred throughout the reporting period as well as three significant community meetings which were held in the same period. As a result of those meetings s 66B applications to remove deceased and/or incompetent applicants were foreshadowed for 2007. 16 Specific reference was made to the Mullewa Wadjari claim which overlaps six other applications in the Geraldton region. Yamatji has been advised that although the application has no viable applicant remaining members of the native title claim group intend to amend it. The promised amendments have not yet been filed with the Court. The Mullewa Wadjari situation affects other mediation programs because of its overlaps with the Nanda, Amangu, Wadjari Yamatji and Naaguja claims. These programs are subject to resolution of the status of the Mullewa Wadjari claim. Yamatji remains willing to meet with the Mullewa Wadjari in early 2007 if the claim remains on foot. Mr George Irving, counsel experienced in native title matters, has been engaged by Yamatji and is endeavouring to organise a meeting with representatives of the Mullewa Wadjari claim group before the end of 2006 to consider resolution of overlaps in the Geraldton region. 17 The Yugunga-Nya claim is subject to programming orders as part of the North-West cluster under the control of Sackville J. Under his Honour's directions programming for mediation of overlaps will follow the handing down of the Wongatha decision in the Goldfields region, now to occur in February 2007. 18 The non-priority claims in the Geraldton region are the Malgana Shark Bay People and the Wadjari Yamatji People. As to the former it is said its overlap with Wadjari Yamatji has been resolved in principle and that Malgana claim amendments givng effect to the resolution are well advanced. The principal difficulty is the extremely high number of named applicants on the claim and the need to collect affidavits from each of them to give effect to the authorised amendments. There are in excess of 40 claimant affidavits in total. The whereabouts of some of the applicants has been unknown and others have been difficult to contact so this has been a very time consuming and difficult process. 19 Yamatji has taken instructions from Wadjari Yamatji to convene a mediation meeting with members of the Widi Binyardi claim group. The Wadjari Yamatji claim is subject to intense future act pressures with numerous small future act applications and several major future act agreements being negotiated during the relevant period. 20 Under separate cover, Yamatji also sent a letter, evidently in response to the directions of 1 August 2006 relating to a single connection report. It had received advice that it would be feasible and time could be saved if there could be a base report written which could be supplemented by individual connection reports for each application in the relevant area. The base report might contain a regional history report written by an historian and a regional anthropology report by an anthropologist. It could utilise research already done in relation to reports prepared but would probably need more research to be carried out over the whole region to be covered. This, it was said, would reduce the work necessary to be repeated for subsequent connection reports. 21 In relation to the Amangu, Hutt River, Naaguja, Widi Binyardi, Taylor and Mullewa Wadjari applications, the last three of which are not represented by Yamatji, Mr Irving was briefed on 14 April 2004 to assist in their resolution through an Alternative Settlement Agreement with the State. According to Mr Irving, the claims, in which Yamatji acts, are at the stage where some connection material could shortly be provided to the State. Yamatji is also providing funds to facilitate independent research for connection material for other claims. Given that one of the State's preconditions for an Alternative Settlement Agreement is that there must be only one agreement inclusive of all interests in the area covered by the overlapping claims, it is Mr Irving's view that the connection materials for all eight overlapping claims should, if possible, be submitted in the one report. 22 The historian's component of the base report has reached penultimate draft form. Meetings were held with working groups for each of the first three mentioned claims between 6 and 8 December 2006 to allow them to read it and to identify errors. Work has commenced on the analysis of historical references in relation to the Widi Mob, Widi Binyardi and the Mullewa Wadjari claimants. However further work on the last mentioned claim was postponed for cultural reasons. 23 At meetings held in Geraldton on 5 to 7 December 2006 each of the Amangu, Hutt River and Naaguja working groups agreed in principle to the establishment of a joint working group to advance negotiations with the State. Mr Irving's attempts to organise a meeting with representatives of Mullewa Wadjari group for 8 December 2006 were unsuccessful. He spoke with Mr Leedham Papertalk who agreed to give him a call and to meet with him when he gets to Perth in the next couple of weeks. He also met with representatives of the Widi Binyardi group on 18 August 2006. They agreed to the establishment of a joint working group and a proposed combination with Widi Binyardi, Taylor and Amangu claims into a single claim. Mr Irving had attended two meetings with the representatives of the Taylor group, the first in April 2004 and the second in July 2005. 24 According to Mr Irving the named applicant in the Widi Mob claim has stated, as a pre-condition to any joint meeting, that the overlapping claim groups must establish their connection to the area through their ancestors. While the historian's report maintains the confidentiality of individual families it will contain an opinion which addresses the issue in respect of each of the overlapping claims. Mr Irving is of the view that the work currently being done by the historian in respect of the Widi Mob applicant will assist in moving the claim forward. Until then, it is his view that nothing would be gained by a Court-directed meeting with the overlapping groups. The work undertaken over the past twelve months has been predicated on the possibility that the connection materials might be finalised before the State had finalised its policy on Alternative Settlement Agreements and the connection criteria to be met by claim groups. Each of the groups, it was said, have agreed that there is value in submitting connection material as soon as possible in the hope of influencing the State's policy. The remaining part of the connection materials will include affidavit evidence from members of each group and written submissions. 25 In addition to Mr Irving's comments the letter of 14 December 2006 from Yamatji raised the desirability of preservation evidence in relation to three claims. It appears that Yamatji proposes to commence proofing witnesses for such examinations in the new year. Tribunal proposals for directions in the Pilbara region 26 The Tribunal has divided the Pilbara region into three sub-regions designated Northeast Pilbara, Northwest Pilbara and Central Pilbara. 27 The Northeast Pilbara subregion comprises the Ngarla, Ngarla # 2, Njamal # 10, Njamal, Warrarn # 1, Birrimaya, Palyku, Nyangumarta and Kulyakartu applications. The Northwest Pilbara subregion comprises Kuruma Marthudunera, Yaburara and Mardudhunera, Wonga-Tt-Oo, Yindjibarndi No 1, Kariyarra People and Bindurrna applications. The Central Pilbara subregion comprises Thalanyji (in the substantive docket of North J), PKKP, PKKP # 2, Jurruru, Innawonga, Innawonga Bunjima, Eastern Guruma (in the docket of Bennett J), Martu Idja Banyjima, Gobawarrah Minduarra Yinhawanga, Ngalawangga and Nyiyaparli. 28 In respect of the Northeast Pilbara subregion the Tribunal proposes orders to the following effect: '1. Before 31 March, the Warrarn and Njamal applicants shall, and Ngarla and Ngarla 2 applicants may, attend a meeting convened by the Tribunal to discuss the resolution of overlaps. 2. The Tribunal, in consultation with the parties, is to prepare a plan for resolution of overlaps and submit it to the Court prior to the next directions hearing. ' 29 As to the Northwest Pilbara subregion the Tribunal proposes: ' . For Kuruma Marthudunera (WAD6090/98), Yaburara & Mardudhunera (WAD127/97), and Wong-Goo-To-Oo (sic) (WAD6256/98): 1. Before 31 March the Kuruma Marthudunera, Yaburara & Mardudhunera, and Wong-Goo-To-Too (sic) are to attend a meeting convened by the Tribunal to discuss the resolution of overlaps. 2. The Tribunal, in consultation with parties is to prepare a plan for resolving the overlaps between Kuruma Marthudunera, Yaburara & Mardudhunera, and Wong-Goo-To-Oo (sic) and present the plan to the Court before the next Directions Hearing. . For Kariyarra (WAD6169/98) 1. Before 31 March, the State and [Yamatji] are to attend a meeting convened by the [Tribunal] to develop a plan for the resolution of connection issues. 2. The Tribunal shall provide a copy of the plan to the Court before the next Directions Hearing. ' 30 In respect of the Central Pilbara subregion the Tribunal proposes the following: ' For Single Innawonga application --- Innawonga (WAD6285/98), Innawonga Bunjima (WAD6096/98), Gobawarrah Minduarra Yinhawanga (WAD6173/98) and Jurruru (WAD6007/00) (4 applications) 1. Before the 31 st March [Yamatji] will provide the [Tribunal] with an outline of steps already taken to effect lodgement of a 'Single Innawonga' application and a plan and timetable for completion of the process. 2. Before the next Directions Hearing the [Tribunal] shall convene a meeting between the Innawonga, GMY and Jurruru claimant groups to determine a process for implementation of the plan. 3. The Tribunal will provide the Court with a copy of the timetable before the next directions hearing. For Single Bunjima application --- Innawonga Bunjima (WAD6096/98 and Martu Idja Bunjima (WAD6278/98) (2 applications) 1. Before the 31 st March [Yamatji] will provide the [Tribunal] with an outline of steps already taken to effect lodgment of a 'Single Bunjima' application and a plan and timetable for completion of the process. 2. Before the next Directions Hearing the [Tribunal] shall convene a meeting between the Innawonga Bunjima and Martu Idja Bunjima claimant groups to determine a process for implementation of the plan. 3. The Tribunal will provide the Court with a copy of the timetable before the next directions hearing. ' Yamatji's response to Tribunal proposals for directions in the Pilbara region 31 By a letter to the Court filed on 13 December 2006 Yamatji referred again to its short staffing in the Pilbara and Perth regions. It pointed out that since the last directions hearing it had lost several senior staff including its Principal Legal Officer, the Manager of the Land Access Unit which deals with future acts and a Senior Legal Officer handling future acts. In addition, the Deputy Principal Legal Officer had taken a year's leave of absence. Although some existing staff have been promoted to or are acting in these positions, additional staff have not been able to be recruited to make up for this. As a result there have been additional workloads and pressure on existing staff. 32 Yamatji says that there has been extensive urgent future act work in the Pilbara particularly with major negotiations involving Pilbara Iron. The lack of available legal officers in its major projects area has meant that lawyers handling native title determination applications in the Pilbara region have had to take on the future act matters as well. It referred to ongoing negotiations with Pilbara Iron and its hope that an arrangement may be finalised soon whereby funding will be provided for up to five connection reports to be prepared in the next two years. Some of these reports, it is said, will be able to deal with two or more claims together. Thus research could be conducted for both the Bunjima claims and the Kuruma claims (PKKP 1 and 2 and Kuruma Marthudunera). The proposal would involve funding a project manager, senior lawyer and co-ordinating anthropologist. 33 Yamatji submits that it is not likely that court orders will be of much assistance in overlap strategies. Most of the difficulties involved in complying with mediation protocols have arisen from not being able to get claimants to reach agreement in relation to overlaps. It is submitted that it is not appropriate to make court orders requiring claimants to settle differences. 34 The letter then dealt with specific applications within the Pilbara region. The powers of the Court 35 The Court has previously made orders requiring parties to prepare mediation protocols and programs and requiring also that they adhere to the timetables in those programs. This has been subject to a tolerance of up to two months on any given step before it was necessary to approach the Court to revise the program. These processes were designed to provide a fairly light-handed approach to Court supervision of the mediation process. It is evident that this scheme has met with only limited success and that the credibility of the mediation programs and protocols is in question. 36 The provisions of the Act mandate referral of native title determination applications to the Tribunal for mediation. The Court, however, has a discretion under s 86(2) to not refer a matter subject to the requirement that it consider factors set out in s 86(4). The Court may order a mediation to cease (s 86(c)(i)). Mediation of native title determination applications by the Tribunal is a central part of the legislative scheme of the Act. Nevertheless, the proceedings the subject of that mediation are proceedings in the Court and the Court ultimately controls the duration of the mediation. 37 Mediation is necessarily consensual. No party can be directed to reach agreement about a pending application or any part of it. Nevertheless the Court can take such steps as are appropriate to ensure the timely progress of mediation under the Act. That power derives from s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). The generality of that provision enables the Court to make such orders as are properly incidental to or supportive of the timely progress of mediations under the Act. For although mediation of native title determination applications is a specific statutory process, it is established for the purpose of resolving pending proceedings in the Court. The link between the purposes of mediation and the resolution of issues in the proceedings in the Court is clear from the terms of s 86A. 38 In my opinion the Court has the power to make orders of reasonable specificity calculated to assist mediation to proceed expeditiously. Whether the Court should make the orders sought by the Tribunal 39 Yamatji expressed scepticism about the utility of the Tribunal proposals for both the Geraldton and Pilbara regions on the basis that in some claims connection reports were under preparation or research was pending, but not yet carried out. The convening of further meetings at this time would not necessarily be a panacea. It was submitted that the parties were not in a position properly to negotiate until requisite research had been done. However, the parties other than Yamatji generally supported the position taken by the Tribunal. 40 In my opinion the Tribunal's approach offers a more structured basis upon which to move the mediations forward in the Pilbara region. The difficulties currently experienced by Yamatji underline the utility of closer support for the process generally from the Tribunal. That is necessarily subject to the proper maintenance of its role as a helpful neutral which is essential for the discharge of its mediation function. A closer involvement by the Tribunal in processes between overlapping applications, between applicants and the State and between represented and unrepresented applicants, will also enable a better information flow to other respondents who tend to be left on the sidelines wondering what is going on between the principal actors. 41 I propose to make orders substantially in terms of the Tribunal's proposals subject to the extension of the dates which it proposes. I will provide the parties with the opportunity to formulate precise minutes of orders in respect of the applications in each of the subregions to give effect to the Tribunal's proposals. Minutes of the proposed orders should be submitted by 19 January 2007. Generally speaking the time limited for compliance with the steps proposed by the Tribunal to be done by 31 March 2007 will be extended to 30 April 2007. Where the Tribunal's proposed draft orders specify 30 April 2007 that time will be extended to 31 May 2007. The next regional directions hearing in each case will be scheduled for 29 June 2007 at 9am. 42 I will request Deputy District Registrar Eaton to review the proposed minutes before they are submitted to me to make the formal orders to ensure that they adequately cover each of the relevant applications. In any case in which the global orders are inapplicable to a particular application, the directions hearing in respect of that application will be adjourned to 29 June 2007. I certify that the preceding forty-two (42) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice French. Associate: Dated: 21 December 2006 Counsel and Solicitors for the various Applicants: See attached Schedule Counsel and Solicitors for the various Respondent: See attached Schedule Dates of Hearing: 15 and 18 December 2006 Date of Judgment: 21 December 2006 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/1811.html","title":"06_1811.txt","id":"3"},{"snippet":"1 On 18 November 2005 I published reasons for judgment in this proceeding; see Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing & Allied Services Union of Australia v ACI Operations Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 1662. On that day the Court ordered the reinstatement of Mr Colin Williams and deferred consideration of penalty and compensation pending the receipt of written submissions. These reasons for judgment should be read together with the reasons for judgment published on 18 November 2005. Penalty 2 The following observations made in the previous judgment are relevant to penalty: • Mr Pillen's refusal to accept the existence of a dispute; [16] • The decision to conduct the stop work meeting at the time it was held arose from Mr Pillen's refusal to acknowledge the existence of a dispute; [17] • It would have been more appropriate, notwithstanding the above point, to hold the meeting at lunchtime; [53] • The \"overbearing and provocative\" manner in which Mr Minniti spoke to Mr Williams; [24] • The different treatment accorded to other employees who had taken strike action but were not disciplined; [29], [43] • The failure to engage the disciplinary code suggested strongly that Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti were keen to be rid of Mr Williams; [37] • That Mr Williams' status as team coordinator did not affect the decision to terminate him; [38], [43] • The breach of s 298K of the Act was blatant and serious; [51], [71] • \"ACI desired to be rid of Mr Williams, who it saw as an active shop steward ... who had given it some grief on industrial issues. \" [52] 3 Counsel for ACI submitted that the decision to terminate Mr Williams was made in response to what Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti understood was Mr Williams' conduct. Counsel also contended that it was action which Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti believed they were entitled to take under the Act. The decision was opportunistic and not premeditated, counsel submitted. 4 Even if it is accepted that the decision was an opportunistic one, it was nonetheless unlawful and, in the circumstances set out in the previous judgment, it constituted a blatant and serious breach of the Act. I do not accept the submission that the termination of Mr Williams flowed from a failure to appreciate the scope of s 298L(1)(a). Mr Gillholme and Mr Minniti are both experienced in industrial relations. They should not have been in any doubt about the illegality of their conduct. 5 I reject the contention that Mr Minniti's reaction to Mr Williams' putting the telephone down showed that Mr Minniti was merely reacting to provocation rather than acting in deliberate defiance of the Act. Mr Minniti had the opportunity to put a considered recommendation to Mr Gillholme. The recommendation was not a spur of the moment decision. 6 Mr Williams' failure to hold the meeting at lunchtime should be considered as only a minor mitigating factor. To class it as a major mitigating factor would reward Mr Pillen's even more inappropriate conduct in failing to accept the existence of a dispute. 7 I further reject the submission that Mr Williams' status as team co-ordinator was \"an ameliorating circumstance\". Such a contention is inconsistent with the reasons for judgment of 18 November 2005, in which the Court found that Mr Williams' status as a team coordinator was not a basis for his termination. 8 I agree with the submission of counsel for ACI that the Court should not take into account the breach of the disciplinary code, in itself. However, as counsel for the Union submitted, adherence to the code may have avoided the situation which ACI now finds itself in as a result of its summary dismissal of Mr Williams. 9 An examination of the relevant facts shows that two senior industrial relations managers, in important roles, made a decision to terminate the employment of an active shop steward, whose industrial representation of the members of the Union working at ACI had displeased them. In the circumstances, a penalty in the high range of those available is appropriate, but for the matters set out below. 10 I now turn to the other factors relevant to the question of penalty as discussed by Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining & Energy Union v Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) (1999) 94 IR 231, as foreshadowed at [79] in the previous judgment. 11 There is no evidence that ACI has previously contravened Pt XA of the Act, or any predecessor provision. That is a mitigating factor. 12 Given that Mr Williams has been reinstated and that ACI has been admonished for its conduct in the 18 November 2005 judgment, there are no continuing consequences in respect of ACI's conduct. 13 The protection of industrial freedom of association and, in this case, freedom of representation, has been upheld by the reinstatement order. 14 The maximum penalty available to the Court is 300 penalty units or $33,000, see s 298U(a)(i) of the Act and s 4AA(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 15 Having regard to the totality of the above matters I consider that a mid-range penalty is appropriate and set the penalty at $16,500. 16 There is no reason why the penalty should not be paid to the Union; see Finance Section Union v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1847 at [71] , per Merkel J and s 356(b) of the Act. Compensation 17 The Union does not currently press for an order for the payment of compensation to Mr Williams. Counsel for the Union informed the Court that ACI has, since 18 November 2005, agreed to make adjustments necessary to ensure Mr Williams' financial position is restored. However, counsel noted that the agreement between the parties had not been fully implemented and submitted that the Court should defer consideration of compensation to allow the agreement to be implemented. 18 It is preferable to allow sufficient time to elapse to permit the parties' agreement to take effect. I will place the onus on the Union to re-agitate this issue within 28 days of these reasons for judgment, failing which there will be no order made under s 298U(c) concerning compensation and the file will be closed. Should the Union wish to re-agitate this issue the Court will convene a directions hearing at 10.15 am on 14 March 2005 to deal with that aspect of this proceeding. Orders 1. Pursuant to s 298U(a)(i) of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) a penalty of $16,500 be imposed on the respondent for its contravention of s 298K(1)(a) of the Act for the prohibited reason referred to in s 298L(1)(a) of the Act. 2. Pursuant to s 356(b) of the Act the penalty be paid to the applicant. 3. The applicant have liberty to apply to the Court within 28 days of the date of this order, for an order requiring the respondent to pay to Mr Colin Williams an amount by way of compensation as the Court thinks appropriate. 4. In the event of liberty to apply under Order 3 not being availed of in the time permitted, the Court will make no order for compensation. I certify that the preceding eighteen (18) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.

Those provisions afford an exemption to a taxpayer in respect of certain foreign termination payments made to the taxpayer. 2 Section 27CD of the Assessment Act relevantly provided that, if an exempt non-resident foreign termination payment is made in relation to a taxpayer, the taxpayer's assessable income does not include that payment. The term exempt non-resident foreign termination payment is defined in s 27A(1) of the Assessment Act as meaning, relevantly, a payment made in respect of a taxpayer to which the following apply: (i) the payment is made in consequence of the termination of that taxpayer's employment; (ii) the payment would be an eligible termination payment; (iii) that employment was service in a foreign country; and (iv) the payment related solely to a period of the employment during which that taxpayer was not a resident of Australia. 3 The applicant, Mr Michael Branson ( the Taxpayer ), received a payment on 1 May 2003 from Deutsche Australia Limited ( Deutsche Australia ). The payment was made following the termination of his employment by Deutsche Australia upon his redundancy. At the time of the termination, the Taxpayer had been on secondment in Tokyo, Japan with Deutsche Securities Limited ( Deutsche Securities ), a company related to Deutsche Australia. 4 The payment made to the Taxpayer on 1 May 2003 was the sum of $535,068.03. That sum was made up as follows: Repatriation allowance: $23,875.00 Annual leave: $125,307.35 Long service leave: $125,277.85 14 month termination payment ( the Redundancy Payment ): $497,068.83 Total: $771,529.03 Less income tax deducted: $236,461.00 Net payment: $535,068.03 5 At the same time as that payment was made to the Taxpayer by Deutsche Australia, Deutsche Securities also made a payment to the Taxpayer of $595,040.17. That sum was made up as follows: Guaranteed bonus for 2002 calendar year: $700,000.00 Less tax: $140,00.00 Net payment (AUD): $560,000.00 Net payment annual leave --- Japan accrual (calculated in JPY then converted to AUD) $35,040.17 Net payment: $595,040.17 THE ASSESSMENT 6 The Taxpayer claimed, relevantly, that, by reason of the operation of s 27CD, his assessable income for the relevant tax year did not include the amount of the Redundancy Payment of $497,068.83. Following an unfavourable objection decision by a delegate of the respondent, the Commissioner of Taxation ( the Commissioner ), the Taxpayer sought review of that decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ( the Tribunal ). On 24 January 2008, the Tribunal affirmed the Commissioner's decision that the Taxpayer's assessable income included the amount of the Redundancy Payment. The Taxpayer then appealed to the Federal Court pursuant to s 44(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) ( the Tribunal Act ). THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL 7 The Taxpayer was employed by Deutsche Australia from June 1992. In 2000, he agreed to be seconded to the Tokyo branch of Deutsche Securities. The terms of the secondment were evidenced by a letter of 28 July 2000 to the Taxpayer from Deutsche Bank AG and a letter of 9 August 2000 to the Taxpayer from Deutsche Securities. 8 The letter of 28 July 2000 confirmed the Taxpayer's assignment to Deutsche Bank, Tokyo. The letter stated that, during the period of the assignment, the terms contained in the letter were to prevail over any of the Taxpayer's terms of employment with Deutsche Australia that may be inconsistent with any of the terms of the letter. The letter stated further that the Taxpayer's employing company would continue to be Deutsche Australia throughout the assignment. The letter dealt with the expected period of assignment, the Taxpayer's remuneration and incidental matters such as transportation and relocation allowances. The letter of 9 August 2000 confirmed the Taxpayer's assignment to Deutsche Securities and dealt with the date of commencement and the duration of the assignment, the salary payment to be made by Deutsche Securities and other incidental matters concerning the terms of the secondment. 9 On 14 October 2002, while still on secondment pursuant to those arrangements, the Taxpayer was informed by a representative of Deutsche Australia that his position had become redundant. Because of the termination of the Taxpayer's employment with Deutsche Australia, his assignment with Deutsche Securities was also terminated. Thus, the Taxpayer worked in Tokyo from 1 August 2000 to 15 October 2002 and was resident in Japan for the whole of that time. The Taxpayer returned to Australia on 22 December 2002. 10 On 17 October 2002 the Taxpayer was informed by telephone that he would be paid an amount in lieu of notice equal to three months' salary. The Taxpayer responded that that was totally unacceptable and was not consistent with his understanding of the practice of Deutsche Australia. 11 On 5 November 2002 Deutsche Bank AG wrote to the Taxpayer setting out the termination payment, repatriation and other arrangements arising as a consequence of the Taxpayer's redundancy, effective 15 October 2002. The termination payment was to include a sum in Australian dollars and another sum in Japanese yen. The Australian dollar amount included the sum of $262,625 as a termination payment equal to 11 months' salary. The Japanese yen payment included a payment in yen of 2.5 months' notice. The letter stated the \"home shadow salary\" on which the Australian dollar amounts had been calculated. The letter also stated that the 2.5 month notice period payment had been calculated at the Taxpayer's net salary rate in yen. 12 On 18 November 2002 the Taxpayer's solicitors wrote to Deutsche Australia saying that the termination payments proposed in the letter of 5 November 2002 reflected only part of the Taxpayer's lawful entitlements. The letter then recited the employment history of the Taxpayer with Deutsche Australia and his secondment to Japan. It also stated the details of bonuses and salaries received while on secondment to Japan. The letter went on to assert that, since there was no express agreement between Deutsche Australia and the Taxpayer as to the length of notice required to terminate his employment, he was entitled to reasonable notice. The letter then asserted as follows: Given our client's length of service, relocation on assignment, current location, experience, seniority, the expected period of time it would take him to find alternative employment (having regard to the deterioration in market conditions), notice of 18 months would be reasonable. A payment of three months' notice is insufficient. The letter went on to demand a payment in lieu of reasonable notice calculated on the basis that the reasonable notice period was 18 months. The letter asserted that the proposed redundancy payment of 11 months' base monthly salary based on the Taxpayer's Australian shadow salary did not reflect his entitlement at law. 13 Deutsche Australia's solicitors replied on 9 December 2002. After reciting various contentions and arguments, the letter made an offer on behalf of Deutsche Australia to make a payment of a sum in Australian dollars representing an actual payment or payment in lieu of a total of 14 months' salary. The payment was to be in full and final satisfaction of any entitlements that the Taxpayer may have \"to notice of termination and redundancy pay\". That proposal is consistent with the proposal in the letter of 5 November 2002. That is to say, the 14 month calculation involved 11 months' redundancy pay and three months' payment in lieu of notice. 14 The proposal for redundancy pay and notice is reflected in redundancy guidelines of Deutsche Australia published to various employees on 25 May 2001. The announcement stated that the formula for redundancies was as follows: Redundancy: 1 month per year of service or part year thereof with a minimum of 2 months and uncapped. Notice: 3 months for Directors and Managing Directors and 1 month for all other staff. At that stage, the Taxpayer was designated as a \"Director\". 15 On 12 December 2002, the Taxpayer's solicitors responded to the letter of 9 December 2002. Their letter canvassed various arguments on behalf of the Taxpayer and included the assertion that the Taxpayer did not accept the proposition that a three month period was reasonable and maintained that 18 months was reasonable for the circumstances that had previously been advised. 16 A draft Statement of Claim by the Taxpayer against Deutsche Australia in the Supreme Court of New South Wales was provided to Deutsche Australia's solicitors on a without prejudice basis in February 2003. While that draft was not before the Tribunal, a Statement of Claim that was subsequently filed made a claim for a payment equivalent to 24 months' salary. An inference can therefore be drawn that the draft Statement of Claim made such a demand. 17 In any event, following the provision of the draft Statement of Claim to Deutsche Australia's solicitors, they wrote again to the Taxpayer's solicitors on 26 February 2003, saying that Deutsche Australia proposed to pay the Taxpayer the sums that it believed he was entitled to in connection with the termination of his employment and some additional amounts as a gesture of good faith. After referring to payments that had already been made, the letter said that Deutsche Australia proposed to pay a further net total of $1,052,426.72. That sum included the sum of $497,068.82, which was described as follows: Termination payment for any other entitlements on termination, including payment in lieu of notice and redundancy. The letter went on to assert that the payment to the Taxpayer would not include a payment in lieu of 24 months' notice, which was said to be \"unreasonable and unjustifiable on any analysis, having regard to [the Taxpayer's] contractual entitlements and circumstances\". 18 The Taxpayer's solicitors responded on 2 April 2003 taking issue with a proposal in the letter of 26 February 2003 to deduct tax in respect of certain of the payments. The letter asserted that Deutsche Australia would have no compulsory Australian or Japanese withholding obligations in relation to payments referable to the Taxpayer's Japanese employment, such as the redundancy payment and the Japanese annual leave payments. The letter asserted that such payments were plainly not eligible termination payments within s 27A of the Assessment Act. 19 On 10 April 2002, the Taxpayer's solicitors wrote again to the solicitors for Deutsche Australia, indicating that a point of difference appeared to be withholding tax from the amount referred to as the 14 month termination payment. The letter relevantly said: Although your client might conceive that our client's redundancy should be 14 months because he is a long standing employee, he will nevertheless be paid solely because his Japanese position, being the relevant employment within paragraph (iii) of the definition [in s 27A] was made redundant by your client. He was a non-resident during the whole time of the relevant employment and the payment will be made only in relation to the redundancy from that employment. His previous employment in Australia, whilst it might operate in the mind of your client in determining the quantum of the payment, is of \"historical significance only,\" and is not a causal factor in the making of the Japanese employment redundancy payment... 20 As I have said, the payments were then made on 1 May 2003 under cover of a letter from Deutsche Australia's solicitors to the Taxpayer's solicitors of that date. The letter enclosed a termination payment schedule showing the calculation of an Australian Related Net Payment of $535,068.03 and a Japan Related Net Payment of $595,040.17. 21 However, the Taxpayer was still not content and, on 30 June 2003, commenced a proceeding against Deutsche Australia in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, claiming damages for wrongful termination of his employment without adequate notice. The proceeding was subsequently settled and on 8 June 2005 a Deed of Release was entered into between the Taxpayer and Deutsche Australia. After reciting, inter alia , the two payments that had already been made on 1 May 2003 by Deutsche Australia and Deutsche Securities, the Deed of Release provided that Deutsche Australia would make a further payment of $700,000 to the Taxpayer as an additional discretionary bonus. In addition, the Deed of Release contained mutual releases of the parties. 22 In the Deed of Release the payment of $535,068.03 was stated to represent a gross amount of $771,529.03 comprising the following: Repatriation allowance: $23,875.00 Payment in lieu of untaken Australian annual leave: $125,307.35 Payment in lieu of untaken Australian long service leave: $125,277.85 14 months' salary, representing a payment in lieu of notice of 3 months and an additional payment pursuant to Deutsche Australia's redundancy guidelines of 11 months' pay calculated by reference to the Taxpayer's Japanese salary: $497,068.83. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION 23 The Tribunal relevantly formulated the issues before it as follows: • Was the whole of the Redundancy Payment of $497,068.83 an exempt non-resident foreign termination payment? • Was part of the Redundancy Payment of $497,068.83 an exempt non-resident foreign termination payment? 24 It was common ground before the Tribunal that those questions involved a determination as to: • whether the Taxpayer's employment was service in a foreign country within paragraph (iii) of the definition; and • whether the Redundancy Payment related solely to a period of the employment during which the Taxpayer was not a resident of Australia within paragraph (iv) of the definition. 25 It was common ground that the Redundancy Payment was made in consequence of the termination of the Taxpayer's employment and that the payment would be an eligible termination payment, such that paragraphs (i) and (ii) of the definition in s 27A(1) of the Assessment Act were satisfied. The grounds of appeal relate to the application of paragraphs (iii) and (iv). 26 The Tribunal found that the Taxpayer's employment over the last two years had been performed in Japan but that he was still employed by Deutsche Australia throughout that period. The Tribunal considered, therefore, that the character of the Redundancy Payment in the Taxpayer's hands would depend on all the surrounding circumstances. 27 The Tribunal found that the Redundancy Payment compensated the Taxpayer for the termination of his position with Deutsche Australia at least in part. The Tribunal observed that, as set out in the Deed of Release, the calculation of the Redundancy Payment was based on 14 months' salary, being 3 months' salary in lieu of notice and an additional payment in accordance with Deutsche Australia's redundancy guidelines. The Tribunal considered that there was nothing to suggest that the payment was to compensate solely for the period of employment while not a resident of Australia, despite the fact that the Taxpayer was in Japan when he was informed of his redundancy. 28 The Tribunal observed that the Deed of Release was not explicit as to whether the payment was compensation for the loss of the Australian employment or for the loss of the position in Tokyo. However, the Tribunal considered that there was a clear implication that the payment was governed by the employment terms in Australia. Thus, the payment was made by Deutsche Australia, the Australian employer, and it was made in accordance with the guidelines applying to Deutsche Australia employees. The Tribunal considered that the perception that the Redundancy Payment was related principally to the long term Australian employment of the Taxpayer was reinforced by the circumstance that Deutsche Securities made a separate payment to the Taxpayer at the same time. That suggested to the Tribunal that Deutsche Securities paid the Taxpayer what it considered was due to him in accordance with the employment letter whereby Deutsche Securities agreed to pay the Taxpayer his Japanese salary. 29 The Tribunal observed that, had the Redundancy Payment been for employment that was service in a foreign country, that could have been made clear by several methods. Nevertheless, since the Commissioner's objection decision had accepted that the payment was for service in a foreign country, the Tribunal declined to vary the decision in that respect. Thus on one view, the Tribunal appears to have concluded that the employment of the Taxpayer, in consequence of the termination of which the Redundancy Payment was made, was service in a foreign country. 30 However, later in its reasons, the Tribunal cast doubt on that as a finding of fact, saying that it was satisfied that the Taxpayer came within paragraphs (i) and (ii) \"and possibly...(iii), but does not satisfy paragraph (iv)...because [the Redundancy Payment] was calculated by taking into account the whole period of his service in and outside Australia. \" 31 The Tribunal then proceeded to consider whether the Redundancy Payment related solely to a period of the Taxpayer's employment during which he was not a resident of Australia. The Tribunal considered that, having regard to the terms of the Deed of Release, the Taxpayer received the Redundancy Payment at least partly in consequence of the loss of his position with Deutsche Australia. That redundancy also brought the overseas secondment to an end. However, the Tribunal did not consider that that automatically meant that the payment was made for the purpose of compensating the Taxpayer for the loss of the employment in Tokyo. 32 The Tribunal found that the Redundancy Payment compensated the Taxpayer for the loss of his employment at Deutsche Australia, including the loss of his contractual entitlement to resume work with Deutsche Australia in Australia when his secondment to Deutsche Securities ended. The Tribunal concluded, therefore, that the amount of the Redundancy Payment took into account the period of the Taxpayer's service within Australia, in addition to his period of service in Japan, and that it followed that the Redundancy Payment did not satisfy the requirement that it be related solely to a period of the employment during which the Taxpayer was not a resident of Australia. 33 The Tribunal then considered the Taxpayer's contention that the Redundancy Payment should be dissected into components. In that regard, the Tribunal observed that, in his objection to the Commissioner's assessment, the Taxpayer had asserted that the 14 months' salary that made up the Redundancy Payment consisted of: (a) three months' salary in lieu of notice; (b) two months' salary for being made redundant, attributable to two years employment in Japan; (c) nine months' salary for being made redundant, attributable to nine years' employment in Australia. That was an assertion apparently made by the Taxpayer's accountant. 34 The Tribunal considered that the definition of exempt non-resident foreign termination payment in s 27A required that the relevant payment must relate solely to a period of the employment during which a taxpayer was a non-resident of Australia. The Tribunal considered that it is the characterisation of that whole payment, not its constituent parts, with which the definition is concerned. Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that, while it may be possible to attribute a portion of the Redundancy Payment to the Taxpayer's service in Tokyo, the whole of the Redundancy Payment nonetheless did not meet the relevant criteria of the definition. THE PRESENT APPEAL 35 In his Supplementary Notice of Appeal, filed on 29 May 2008, the Taxpayer formulated the following questions of law: (a) whether \"service in a foreign country\" within para (a)(iii) of the definition ... means the physical location of the taxpayer's employment or means the physical location of the taxpayer's employer. (b) whether the question of whether a payment \"related solely to a period of the [taxpayer's] employment during which the taxpayer was not a resident of Australia\" within para (a)(iv) of the definition ... is to be determined by an objective consideration of the facts and circumstances, or whether the subjective beliefs either of the employer or the taxpayer, or the beliefs of each, are determinative or to be taken into account. (c) whether, on the facts as found properly by the Tribunal, all of the payment of $497,069 \"related solely to a period of the [Taxpayer's] employment during which the taxpayer was not a resident of Australia\" within para (a)(iv) of the definition .... (d) whether on a proper construction of the definition ... a lump sum payment can be dissected into components, such that a part is capable of being \"related solely to a period of the [taxpayer's] employment during which the taxpayer was not a resident of Australia\" within para (a)(iv) of the definition. 36 Section 44 of the Tribunal Act provides that a party may appeal to the Federal Court, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal. The existence of a question of law is not merely a qualifying condition to ground an appeal from a decision of the Tribunal. Rather, it and it alone, is the subject matter of the appeal and the ambit of the appeal is confined to that question of law: Brown v The Repatriation Commission [1985] FCA 194 ; (1985) 7 FCR 302. The Commissioner contends that the first three of those purported questions are not questions of law and should be struck out. 37 The thrust of the Taxpayer's contentions, in effect, is that, at the time of the termination of his employment, he was physically located in Tokyo and was not a resident of Australia. He contends that, while the period of reasonable notice may properly be determined by reference to the time of his employment by Deutsche Australia, the relevant fact is that, at the time of termination, he was being remunerated by Deutsche Securities and the Redundancy Payment was made in circumstances where he had asserted, through his solicitors, an entitlement to a payment equivalent to 24 months' salary, and had asserted that any such payment would not be subject to deduction of tax because it was a payment within the definition in s 27A. 38 The grounds of appeal are not easy to comprehend. First, the Taxpayer says that the Tribunal erred in considering that legal employment by Deutsche Australia, an Australian entity, was service not in a foreign country under paragraph (iii). Rather, he says, the Tribunal should have considered the legislative context, which included s 23AG of the Assessment Act, which had the effect that salary paid while not a resident would be exempt. The Taxpayer asserts that, had he been given reasonable notice, the reasonable notice period of 14 months would have been worked out in Japan for which he would have received salary that would have been exempt. However, there was no finding to that effect by the Tribunal. Indeed, the Tribunal was not asked to make such a finding. It is certainly not self-evident that such a finding should or could have been made on the material before the Tribunal. The first ground has no substance. 39 The second ground is that, in so far as the Tribunal inferred from the fact that the Taxpayer's legal employment was with Deutsche Australia, an Australian entity, that there was in fact some service not in a foreign country during the period of the Taxpayer's secondment to Japan, the Tribunal made an error of law. The Taxpayer contended that, while on secondment, his service was service in Japan and he was made redundant from that Japanese position, and that, therefore, the payment was a payment in lieu of notice of termination of his service in Japan. 40 However, that is not the finding made by the Tribunal. The Tribunal clearly found that the payment related not only to the time that the Taxpayer served on secondment in Japan but also to the time of his service in Australia from 1992 until 2000. That was a finding of fact from which there is no appeal under s 44 of the Tribunal Act. In any event, the finding was clearly correct in the light of the exchange of correspondence between the Taxpayer's solicitors and the solicitors for Deutsche Australia. 41 The third ground is that the Tribunal should have characterised the Redundancy Payment solely by reference to that in respect of which it objectively was a payment, that is to say, it was a payment in lieu of reasonable notice of termination of in Japan. As I have said, that is a question of fact and, on the material before the Tribunal, there appears to be no error. 42 The Taxpayer contended that the Tribunal erroneously calculated the Redundancy Payment by reference to how it was calculated by Deutsche Australia. The Taxpayer contends that it is erroneous to characterise a payment by the means by which it is calculated. He contends that it is highly irrelevant that Deutsche Australia called the payment \"14 months' salary. \" What is relevant, he says, is that the payment was in response to his claim for a payment equivalent to 24 months' salary in lieu of 24 months' reasonable notice of termination of his Japanese secondment. He asserts that, since there was no agreement as to the character of the payment made by Deutsche Australia to the Taxpayer, one is left with the objective circumstances. The Taxpayer contends that the Tribunal erred in focusing on the subjective view of Deutsche Australia. He says that that erroneous view is magnified by its observation that the Taxpayer had not presented any corroborative evidence of his own view of how the money should be apportioned. 43 The Taxpayer contends, further, that the Tribunal erred in considering the recitals in the Deed of Settlement as evidencing what one party had stated and done unilaterally some two years previously. He advanced the proposition, which is undeniable, that the conduct of the parties after the event could not, by itself, change the character of the payment. However, that is not what the Tribunal was doing. It was endeavouring to do precisely what the Taxpayer contended, namely, to characterize the redundancy payment by reference to the surrounding circumstances. One relevant factor is that, albeit two years later, the two parties entered into a Deed of Settlement in which they acknowledged the character of the payment. While, as I have said, that acknowledgement cannot change the character, it is of relevance in terms of how the parties considered it at the time when the payment was made. 44 The Taxpayer emphasised that the payment was made only because he had claimed wrongful termination of his Japanese secondment. When made in 2003, the Redundancy Payment was in partial satisfaction of the Taxpayer's claim for payment in lieu of 24 months' notice of termination of his Japanese secondment. Again however, that misstates the circumstances. The clear thrust of the correspondence is that the Taxpayer had been employed by Deutsche Australia for eight or nine years before his secondment to Japan. The payment made on 1 May was paid by reference to 14 months' salary. That payment represented three months' pay in lieu of notice and one month for each year of employment, including Australian employment, in accordance with the guidelines of Deutsche Australia. 45 A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons indicates that it had regard to the exchanges of correspondence and the assertions made by the Taxpayer's solicitors. It is difficult to see any error on the part of the Tribunal in concluding that the payment related to employment in Australia as well as the period of employment in Japan. The Redundancy Payment was calculated in accordance with the guidelines, which recognised that the period of employment in Australia was relevant. That is precisely the contention that was advanced by the Taxpayer's solicitors prior to the payment. I do not consider that there is any substance in the third ground. 46 The fourth ground advanced by the Taxpayer is that the Tribunal erred in applying a subjective test in having regard to the fact that Deutsche Australia took into account, in deciding what it would pay the Taxpayer, the long term employment of the Taxpayer by Deutsche Australia. For the reasons I have already indicated, I do not consider that that is an accurate characterisation of the approach adopted by the Tribunal. The material before the Tribunal made it patently obvious that the Redundancy Payment related to the Taxpayer's service with Deutsche Australia in Australia as well as his service in Tokyo. 47 I do not consider that there is any error of law on the part of the Tribunal in concluding that the redundancy payment did not relate solely to a period of employment of the Taxpayer during which he was not a resident of Australia. The Tribunal found as a fact, on the material before it, without error, that the Redundancy Payment related both to the period of his employment while a resident of Australia from 1992 to 2000, as well as the period of his employment during which he was resident in Japan. 48 That then raises the second real issue, namely, whether the Tribunal erred in failing to hold that part of the Redundancy Payment related solely to the period of the Taxpayer's employment during which he was resident in Japan. The Commissioner accepts that that raises a question of law but says that there was no error on the part of the Tribunal in the conclusion that it reached. 49 It would be wrong to allow a determination of the character of a receipt in the hands of the recipient to be affected by a consideration of the uncommunicated reasoning that led the payer to agree to make the payment. On the other hand, in a proper case, a single payment or receipt of a mixed nature may be apportioned amongst the several heads to which it relates. Thus, it may be appropriate to follow such a course where the payment or receipt is in settlement of distinct claims of which some at least are liquidated or are otherwise ascertainable by calculation. On the other hand, it will not be appropriate where the payment or receipt is in respect of a claim or claims for unliquidated damages only and is made or accepted under a compromise that treats it as a single undissected amount of damages. In such a case, the amount must be considered as a whole: McLaurin v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1961] HCA 9 ; (1961) 104 CLR 381 at 391. 50 The Commissioner accepts that, had there been a basis for apportioning part of the Redundancy Payment, such that it could be said that that part was attributable to the Taxpayer's service in Japan and related solely to the period of his employment in Japan, it may have been possible to dissect the Redundancy Payment. However, no such apportionment was made by the Taxpayer and Deutsche Australia. There was a dissection made, in the correspondence that led to the payment, insofar as a distinction was drawn between redundancy and payment in lieu of notice. However, that distinction was not related to the respective periods of employment in Australia and in Japan. The 11 months' redundancy was calculated by reference to the total period of employment of the Taxpayer by Deutsche Australia from the Taxpayer's commencement in 1992 until his termination in 2002. Similarly, the payment in lieu of notice was not limited to the period of his employment in Japan. The material before the Tribunal indicated that the Taxpayer continued to be employed by Deutsche Australia. Deutsche Australia terminated his employment, albeit at a time when he was serving in Japan and was non-resident. 51 It may have been possible for the Taxpayer and Deutsche Australia to agree on the manner in which the Redundancy Payment was to be apportioned as between service in Japan and service in Australia, such that that part attributable to the service in Japan would not be included in the Taxpayer's assessable income. However, they did not do that. There was no error of law on the part of the Tribunal in concluding that dissection of the Redundancy Payment was not permissible in the circumstances before it. 52 It follows that the Taxpayer's appeal must be dismissed. I understand the parties have agreed that the Commissioner will bear the Taxpayer's costs in any event. I certify that the preceding fifty-two (52) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Emmett. Associate: Dated: 15 December 2008 Counsel for the Applicant: M Robertson Solicitor for the Applicant: Ernst & Young Law Counsel for the Respondent: J Davies SC & M T Flynn Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor Date of Hearing: 1 December 2008 Date of Judgment: 1 December 2008 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/1874.html","title":"08_1874.txt","id":"5"},{"snippet":"This is an application for interlocutory orders as framed in an application filed by the applicant on 20 November 2009. In the principal proceeding, the applicant seeks injunctions restraining the first and second respondents from importing, promoting, distributing, advertising or otherwise offering for sale counterfeit hairstyling products bearing the mark GHD or, alternatively, marks described as \"GHD Styler\" or \"GHD\", or any other style which would constitute an infringement of the registered trade mark 951664 registered in respect of the letters GHD for the articles the subject of the proceeding. In addition to injunctions restraining the first and second respondents in those terms, the applicant seeks delivery up for destruction of infringing articles, damages or, alternatively, at its election, account of profits, interest and other related orders consistent with the principal relief. Apart from the final relief as just described, the applicant seeks interlocutory injunctions restraining the first and second respondents from engaging in the same conduct pending the trial of the action. The interlocutory orders, as framed, would also, in effect, run until earlier order made by the court. The remaining interlocutory orders are orders directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service pursuant to the provisions of the Trade Marks Act and, in particular, section 137(5) which provides that, if after 20 working days from the day on which the action was commenced (in this case, 20 November 2009), there is not in force at any time an order of the court directed to the Customs CEO preventing the goods from being released, the Customs CEO must release the goods to the designated owner. The elements of the cause of action alleged against the first and second respondents are the subject of an affidavit from Ms Kelly Maree Gardner sworn 24 November 2009. The events giving rise to the controversy between the applicant and these respondents essentially arises out of three Notices of Seizure to Objector, which were issued by the Australian Customs Service to the applicant. The first was on 19 October 2009 and two others were issued on 20 October 2009. Each of them bears a designation number, the first of which is DGMS N0090959CL. The other two bear numbers N0091060PJ and N0090788PJ, which identify the particular articles the subject of the proceedings. Ms Gardner deposes in her affidavit to her role as a brand protection officer for the applicant and, at paragraph 3, gives evidence of her experience in the identification of counterfeit GHD irons and/or other stylers. Ms Gardner says that she is able to identify the counterfeit nature of such a product, either from pictures she examines, a review of the actual product or written descriptions of the product in the relevant case. At paragraph 22 of the affidavit, Ms Gardner says that she has reviewed photographs of the seized items the subject of the three notices I have just described by reference to the identification numbers above. Those photographs were provided to Ms Gardner by the Australian Customs Service. Ms Gardner says that, by reference to those photographs, she immediately identified the seized items as counterfeit. She says that the easiest way of identifying the counterfeits is the verification code on the inside arm of the iron which has been photographed by Customs. Ms Gardner then describes, in a little detail, the verification codes depicted in the photographs which informs her conclusion that each of the articles the subject of the photographs are counterfeit articles. I am satisfied that, having regard to the affidavit of Ms Gardner, the applicant has made out a prima facie case of infringement of the trade mark in relation to articles which are not of the manufacture of the applicant or its parent, for the purposes of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 per Gleeson CJ and Crennan J at [19] and Gummow and Hayne JJ at [65] to [72]. A further question arises in relation to the specific elements of section 136 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) which provides that the Customs CEO must release the seized goods to their designated owner if, within the action period, Jemella has not brought an action for infringement of the notified trade mark in respect of the goods, and given to the customs CEO notice in writing of the action. The action period relevantly expired in respect of the first notice on 20 November 2009 and in respect of the second and third notices on 23 November 2009. The action was commenced on 20 November 2009 for infringement of the notified trade mark in respect of all of the goods. Mr Fox has appeared today on behalf of Jemella. He has given an undertaking to file an affidavit which will annex a copy of an email tendered to the court in relation to this very question. Mr Fox's email of Friday, 20 November 2009 at 4.09 pm, directed to officers of the Australian Customs Service, gives notice that Jemella has commenced the proceedings in question and the email attaches a letter confirmatory of that matter as well. Therefore, I am satisfied that s 136 of the Trade Marks Act has been met. That question is material to whether or not the court ought to make an order under s 137(5) directed to the CEO of the Australian Customs Service as sought in the interlocutory application. If, of course, the applicant had not given notice within the action period, then the CEO of the Australian Customs Service would be under a statutory obligation to release the goods and a question would arise as to whether an order ought to be made s 137(5) in all the circumstances. The position here is that notice has been given and those elements have been satisfied. The further matter is that there is a supplementary affidavit by Ms Gardner which goes to attempts to serve documents on the respondents. This application is an ex parte application. The report as to service identifies aspects of the attempts to serve the respondents with the Court papers. The service report contains material which suggests that the first respondent is, and will be, out of the jurisdiction for approximately three to four months. Nevertheless, the applicant proposes to continue to attempt to effect service of the papers on the respondents. The proposed orders contemplate that if any notice of motion is to be brought on which would arise in circumstances where the applicant has been able to find and serve the first and second respondents with the Court papers, such a motion would also be brought on, on the review date. On the footing that the first respondent is likely to be out of the jurisdiction for some time, it seems to me that the appropriate course is to re-list the matter for directions at 9.30 am on 20 January 2009 so the court might be informed about the status of the matter generally, and information will then be forthcoming about whether a notice of motion is to be heard and determined in relation to the matter more generally and if so, when. The background circumstances relating the trade mark and a copy of the trade mark certificate and the matters relating to the verification code, analysis of counterfeit articles and, in particular, the virtue of the authentic article that it meets all electricity safety approvals and is thus safe for the use for which it is intended, is deposed to in the affidavit of Mr Anthony Grigson sworn 23 November 2009. Having regard to all of these matters, then, I propose to make orders in terms of the draft orders which provide for liberty to apply on three days' notice in the event that service is effected upon the respondents, and they seek to discharge the interlocutory injunction for any reason. I will make orders in terms of the draft as initialled by me, subject to the amendment to order 7, adding the directions date of 9.30, 20 January 2010. There is one further matter that should be mentioned and that goes to a further affidavit of Ms Gardner. Ms Gardner filed an affidavit sworn 24 November 2009, in which she deposes to her search of eBay, which is part of her standard protocol for seeking to isolate and identify counterfeit articles. In this affidavit Ms Gardner says that on 14 September 2009, the applicant reported to eBay a listing for user name, \"gabbyandsara44\". The applicant then obtained copies of the eBay listing which provided information as to the seller's list of items for sale and the seller's items sold in the last 15 days. Ms Gardner says that eBay suspended the listing and provided the third respondent, who is Jemella Group Limited, with information relating to eBay user, \"gabbyandsara44\". That information identified the user as \"Gabby Daizli of 12 Tantangara Street, Miller, New South Wales, 2170\", at an email address of gabbyandsara@live.com with a telephone number. The material suggests that the first and second respondents are seeking to sell GHD-designated articles on eBay which the applicant contends are not authentic articles. A copy of the eBay entry is attached to the affidavit. I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.

SCHEDULE B Attention to Client Name Address Date XX, 2009 Dear XXXXX, DISCLOSURE NOTICE - Federal Court Ordered Notice re Emerald Passport The Federal Court of Australia has made orders against Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd (\"Cosic Holdings\") and Mr John Cosic following action taken by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (\"ACCC\") in relation to an illegal pyramid selling scheme. Section 65AAC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (\"the TPA\") states that: (1) A corporation must not participate in a pyramid selling scheme. (2) A corporation must not induce, or attempt to induce, a person to participate in a pyramid selling scheme. An illegal pyramid selling scheme occurs when participants are induced to make a payment to join a scheme by the prospect that they will receive recruitment payments for introducing others to the same scheme. A scheme may be a pyramid selling scheme even though goods or services are offered as part of the scheme. The Court declared that Cosic Holdings breached section 65AAC of the TPA by participating in a pyramid selling scheme known as Emerald Passport. The Court found that during the period September 2006 to November 2007, Cosic Holdings participated in the Emerald Passport scheme (\"the Scheme\") by conduct including: establishing and controlling Internet websites that related to the Scheme; printing promotional material relating to the Scheme; arranging live and recorded telephone conference calls for prospective participants in the Scheme; arranging advertising about the Scheme in the Quokka and Community News newspapers; referring, encouraging and recommending to people that they obtain more information about the Scheme, or that they become involved in the Scheme; paying money to Emerald Passport Inc for the provisions of products to purchasers under the Scheme; paying money to other participants in the Scheme for products supplied or promoted by Emerald Passport Inc in relation to the Scheme; and receiving payments from Scheme participants in relation to the Scheme from at least 18 September 2006 to 26 October 2007. The Court also declared that Cosic Holdings' director, Mr John Cosic, was a party to that conduct. The Court has made orders which prevent Cosic Holdings and Mr Cosic from participating in similar schemes. The Court also ordered that Cosic Holdings: send this letter to persons who were introduced to the Scheme by Cosic Holdings or Mr Cosic; publish corrective notices in the West Australian, Quokka and Community News newspapers; and pay the ACCC's court costs. Should you require any further information, please contact me on [insert telephone number]. Yours sincerely, John Cosic Director Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd SCHEDULE C BY ORDER OF THE FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA The Federal Court of Australia has declared that Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd ( Cosic Holdings ) contravened the pyramid selling provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 ( TPA ) by participating in a pyramid selling scheme known as Emerald Passport . The declaration was made following court action taken by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. Pyramid selling is where people are induced to pay money to join a scheme by the prospect that they can make money primarily by getting other people to also pay to join the schemes. The participant's success depends on the number of other people they can recruit to the scheme, and in turn the people they can recruit. Such schemes are illegal. The Emerald Passport scheme ( Scheme ) was created by Emerald Passport Inc, a company incorporated in Panama. The Scheme involved the sale of various self help products. To earn income in the Scheme, participants were required to qualify as a 'Director' which involved making an annual payment to Emerald Passport Inc and recruiting other people to the Scheme. Once qualified, a Director was entitled to a commission when they recruited new participants and received further commissions from the qualifying sales that those people made. The Federal Court found that Cosic Holdings had contravened the pyramid selling provisions of the TPA by establishing or controlling websites relating to the Scheme, printing promotional material, and receiving payments from other participants in the Scheme. The Court also declared that the company's director, Mr John Cosic, was a party to that conduct. The Court has made orders which prevent Cosic Holdings and Mr Cosic from participating in similar schemes. The Court also ordered that Cosic Holdings publish this notice and pay the ACCC's costs of the court action. What follows are the reasons for the making of these orders by consent. AGREED FACTS The parties together submit that the Court should make the orders sought as set out in a minute of proposed consent orders, having regard to the conduct of the first respondent and the second respondent. In that regard, the parties through their solicitors signed a statement of agreed facts dated 4 December 2009. The Court received this statement of agreed facts at the hearing of the application. As explained further below it appears to the Court that it is appropriate to regard the statement of agreed facts in determining whether or not to make orders in the proceeding by consent of the parties. The statement of agreed facts provides as follows. The applicant (Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC)) is, and was at all material times, a body corporate established by s 6A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (Act). The first respondent, Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd (Cosic Holdings) is and was at all material times: (a) a company duly incorporated and carrying on business in Australia; and (b) a corporation within the meaning of the Act. The second respondent (Mr Cosic) is and was at all material times a director of Cosic Holdings. Emerald Passport Inc is and was at all material times: (a) a company duly incorporated in the Republic of Panama; and (b) the publisher of the Internet websites www.emeraldpassport.cc and www.epassportinc.com (Emerald Passport website).

Emerald Passport Inc: (a) creates, and at all material times created, product marketing tools for participants to use in their promotional activities in relation to the Emerald Passport Scheme; (b) maintains the operation of the Emerald Passport website; (c) accepts registrations to become a Distributor through the Emerald Passport website; (d) receives payment of the Annual Fee from participants in the Emerald Passport Scheme; and (e) receives payment of a portion of the product price as described in [12(h)] above. The payment of the Annual Fee referred to in [12(d)] above, which must be made by persons to become Distributors, is a payment to Emerald Passport Inc. At all material times, the Paramount Partners website (as defined in [17(b)(iv)] below) promoted the income earning potential of the Emerald Passport Scheme through recruiting new participants, to a much greater degree than it promoted the Products themselves. The Paramount Partners website did this by: (a) having the substantial majority of information on its web pages dedicated to promoting the income earning potential of the Emerald Passport Scheme, rather than the Products (see the web page indexes in Sch D1, Sch E and Sch F; see also Sch D2 --- D5); (b) using the following words and phrases (see Sch D2): (i) 'To understand why our business model is superior to any other and to see why joining our business could easily make you a millionaire over the next 2-5 years, you need understand the power of this compensation program. ' (ii) 'High Ticket, High Demand, High Profit Product line pays you an instant profit of $1000, $4500 or $10,000 per sale. ' (iii) 'All customers in your customer base will purchase these products through you, and once qualified you'll be positioned to receive profits of $4500 and $10,000 on Phase 2 and Phase 3 product sales'; and (c) using the words, phrases and images on slides 6 to 10 of the 'Comp Presentation' available for download from the Paramount Partners website (see Sch D2). The following table sets out the sale price of the Products against the commissions retained for the sale of Products to participants. The commissions represent a high proportion of the Product price: Product Product price Commission Phase 1 Product US$1,295 US$1,000 Phase 2 Product US$5,995 US$4,500 Phase 3 Product US$14,995 US$10,000 Between 18 September 2006 and November 2007, Cosic Holdings: (a) traded as LifestyleXpress; (b) established, controlled, operated and contributed to or was otherwise involved with the following Internet websites that refer to, link to or otherwise relate to the Emerald Passport Scheme: (i) www.lifestylexpress.info; (ii) www.profitmasters.biz; (iii) www.growthconnections.biz; and (iv) www.paramountpartners.info (Paramount Partners website); (c) printed promotional material, including pamphlets about the Emerald Passport Scheme; (d) arranged live and recorded telephone conference calls made available for download by prospective participants; (e) arranged internet advertising about the Emerald Passport Scheme on the www.seek.com.au, www.google.com.au, ubiz and ubetheboss Internet websites; (f) arranged advertising in the Quokka and Community News newspapers; (g) referred, encouraged and recommended or otherwise suggested to at least 30 people that they obtain more information about the Emerald Passport Scheme, or that they become involved in the Emerald Passport Scheme (see the summary of invoices issued by Cosic Holdings (trading as LifestyleXpress) at Schedule A (but not reproduced in this judgment), which lists the people that Cosic Holdings and/or Mr Cosic introduced to the Scheme); (h) paid money to Emerald Passport Inc for the provision of Products to purchasers under the Emerald Passport Scheme; (i) paid money to other participants in the Emerald Passport Scheme for products supplied or promoted by Emerald Passport Inc in relation to the Emerald Passport Scheme; and (j) received: (i) payments from individuals to whom Cosic Holdings promoted the Emerald Passport Scheme (see Sch A); and (ii) commissions from individuals to whom Cosic Holdings promoted the Emerald Passport Scheme of approximately $115,000 (USD) (see Sch A). Between 18 September 2006 and November 2007, Mr Cosic: (a) established the Paramount Partners website on behalf of Cosic Holdings for the purpose of promoting and giving information in relation to the Emerald Passport Scheme; (b) chaired recorded conference calls relating to the Emerald Passport Scheme on behalf of Cosic Holdings; (c) created and edited documents and guides available on the Paramount Partners website; (d) established personal websites for potential participants to contact Mr Cosic directly; and (e) designed and approved advertising flyers for use by Emerald Passport Scheme participants in marketing the Products and the Emerald Passport Scheme. The Emerald Passport Scheme is promoted by making available to persons, including persons within Australia, information on the Internet and through the methods described in [17(c)] to [17(g)] above. The information referred to in [12] above is made available on the Emerald Passport website, and other websites to which the Emerald Passport website provides links. These websites include: (i) www.productwow.com; (ii) www.wealthandself.com; and (iii) www.sixfigureincomeschool.com; Information about the Emerald Passport Scheme was also made available on the websites referred to in [17(b)] above and through the methods described in [17(c)] to [17(g)]. Information on the websites referred to in [17(b)] above was made available to persons within Australia by Cosic Holdings. Cosic Holdings promoted, participated and took part in the Emerald Passport Scheme. Mr Cosic was the person solely responsible for the acts and omissions of Cosic Holdings, and was party to all of the conduct engaged in by Cosic Holdings that is referred to in this document. THE CONTRAVENING CONDUCT The applicant, ACCC, and the respondents do not dispute that the conduct of the respondents identified by the facts agreed between them constitutes a pyramid selling Scheme. Section 65AAC of the Act provides that a corporation must not participate in a pyramid selling Scheme and must not induce, or attempt to induce, a person to participate in a pyramid selling Scheme. Section 64AAD(1) of the Act defines a \"pyramid selling Scheme\" to mean a Scheme with both the following characteristics: (a) to take part in this Scheme, some or all new participants must make a payment (participation payment) to another participant or participants in the Scheme; (b) the participation payments are entirely or substantially induced by the prospect held out to new participants that they will be entitled to a payment (recruitment payment) in relation to the introduction to the Scheme of further new participants. Section 65AAE provides that, to decide whether a marketing Scheme is a pyramid selling Scheme, the Court may have regard (but is not limited) to the following matters in working out whether the participation payments under the Scheme are entirely or substantially induced by the prospects held out to new participants of entitlement to recruitment payments: (a) the extent to which the participation payments bear a reasonable relationship to the value of the goods or services that participants are entitled to be supplied under the Scheme, as assessed, if appropriate, by reference to the price of comparable goods or services available elsewhere; (b) the emphasis given in the promotion of the Scheme to the entitlement of participants to the supply of goods or services by comparison with the emphasis given to their entitlement to recruitment payments. The Emerald Passport Scheme promoted by the respondents contained three phases of self-help products, sold through the internet by people who had registered as \"Distributors\" or who had qualified as \"Directors\" in that Scheme. The Scheme promoted income earning opportunities for Directors through the introduction of new participants to the Scheme. Participants could only earn an income by becoming a Director and inducing new participants to the Scheme. The details of the operation of the Scheme are set out in [12] above. To take part in the Scheme the participants were obliged to first register as Distributors through the Emerald Passport website. To register as a Distributor, participants were required to pay an annual fee of US$99 (annual fee). This fee constitutes a participation payment under s 65AAD(1)(a) of the Act. This is because participants must pay this fee annually to take part in the Scheme. As noted, s 65AAD(1)(b) requires that a participation payment made by a new participant be entirely or substantially induced by the prospect held out that they will be entitled to a recruitment payment for introducing further participants to the Scheme. The payment itself must be in relation to the introduction and it must be the predominant inducement: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Wordplay Services Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1138 ; (2004) 210 ALR 562 at [110] . In determining the requisite connection between the payment described as a recruitment and the introduction to the Scheme of further new participants, there needs to be a relevant, sufficient or material connection, rather than merely a causal connection or relationship: see Australian Communications Network v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2005] FCAFC 221 ; (2005) 146 FCR 413 at [33] , where the Full Federal Court stated that: A payment that is, in substance, a payment for the introduction of new participants is an aspect of the vice or mischief aimed at by the legislative scheme. But the question of whether payments made, eg, under a multi-level marketing scheme as a result of post-introduction activities of the members introduced by participants were also intended to be recruitment payments requires consideration of whether such payments were also considered to be part of that vice or mischief. The concept of inducement entails some analysis of what persuades or influences the relevant persons: ACCC v Wordplay Services Pty Ltd at [106]. This analysis requires an objective inquiry: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Communications Network Pty Ltd (2005) 146 FCR 23 at [24]. In this case, on an objective view, it is open to the Court to find the annual fee participation payment which people were required to make to participate in the Scheme was substantially induced by the prospect held out to new participants that they would be entitled to payments, or commissions, in relation to the introduction of new participants to the Scheme. These commission payments constitute recruitment payments under s 65AAD(1)(b) because the only reason a participant would pay the annual fee participation payment is so that they could participate in the Scheme and earn the frequent payments by introducing other participants to the Scheme. In this regard, the terms of the agreed facts set out at [12], [13] and [14], above, are relevant. It should also be said that on this basis the Scheme would constitute a pyramid selling scheme and not a marketing scheme for the following reasons: Between 18 September 2006 and November 2007, the first respondent: Between 18 September 2006 and November 2007, the second respondent: It is therefore open to the Court to declare that by its conduct in relation to the Scheme, Cosic Holdings participated in a pyramid selling Scheme in contravention of s 65AAC(1) of the Act. The parties concur that this declaration should be made. It is also open to the Court to declare that by his conduct in relation to the Scheme, Mr Cosic knew of the elements of the contravention of s 65AAC(1) by Cosic Holdings and was a party to Cosic Holdings' contravention of s 65AAC(1). The parties also concur that this declaration should be made. THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE PROPOSED ORDERS While the parties have signed a minute of proposed consent orders, it is well understood and recognised by the parties to this proceeding that it is finally for the Court to determine what relief, if any, should be ordered. In determining whether to make the orders sought, the Court must be satisfied that what is proposed is in the public interest. The Court must weigh the public interest and the desirability and agreed resolution of enforcement proceedings such as these commenced by the ACCC: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79. The Court's power to make orders extends to making orders in proceedings resolved between the parties by consent. In this regard in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Target Ltd [2001] FCA 1326 at [24] , Lee J stated: It is the Court's duty in receiving consent orders in any matter to scrutinise such orders as to their appropriateness. However, after being satisfied as to the appropriateness of the orders, the Court should be slow to impede final settlement of such matters, particularly those involving public interest considerations. Moreover, the public has an interest in the mutual resolution of litigation, and subject to the foregoing the Court should be careful not to refuse to make orders simply because the orders may have been different had it been the Court's task to formulate them. See also Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc at [20], per French J. A question first arises as to the appropriateness of the declarations that the parties have proposed by consent. By the proposed declarations, the Court would declare certain conduct of the respondents to be in contravention of the pyramid selling provisions of the Act. The power of the Court to make a declaration in this case is found in s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Ordinarily speaking, declarations should determine a legal controversy and not answer abstract or hypothetical questions: see Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] . In a case such as the present, it seems to me that the proposed declarations deal with real issues with real consequences and do not involve abstract or hypothetical questions. In particular: Furthermore, Cosic Holdings and Mr Cosic are proper contradictors because they are persons whose conduct is referred to in the proposed declarations and who have an interest in opposing them. Finally, the making of the proposed declarations is in the public interest and serves to mark the Court's disapproval of the particular conduct engaged in, in contravention of the Act. While there is a well understood rule of practice that a Court should be slow to grant a declaration involving a public right in the absence of \"evidence\" that supports the declaration (as to which see BMI v Federated Clerks Union of Australia (1983) 51 ALR 401 at 413 - 414; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 960, Finkelstein J at [18] --- [19]), I am satisfied that on the material before the Court and in light of the statement of agreed facts to which the parties to this proceeding have subscribed and the Court has received, it is appropriate for the Court to make the declarations sought without requiring the taking of evidence in a more formal way. In taking this practical approach it seems to me relevant to note that the application is that of the ACCC, a public agency charged with the administration of these relevant consumer provisions of the Act, and that the agreement between the parties of the facts that are relevant to the outcome of the case and the orders that should be made follow pleadings filed and served by the parties. It is appropriate in such circumstances for the Court to treat the information put forward if not strictly \"evidence\" then as sufficiently reliable for the Court to act upon. Further, the parties are represented by experienced, competent solicitors and counsel and are fully aware of the consequences of the making of the declarations. To the extent that there are parties not directly involved in these proceedings who may be interested in or affected by the proposed orders , the declarations are sufficiently narrowly couched so as to direct attention to the conduct of the named respondents in this proceeding and no others. In general terms I consider that enforcement proceedings under the Act brought by the ACCC, the objects of the Act, and the overarching principles that ought govern a proceeding such as this, in terms of expedition and costs, all support the view that the Court should be prepared to entertain the making of declarations by consent on the basis of the sort of information currently before the Court. I note that in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Allergy Pathway Pty Ltd , Finkelstein J of this Court, at [16], noted a number of New South Wales Supreme Court decisions that have followed the course that I now propose to adopt, but different from what his Honour there proposed. In those other decisions the Court had acknowledged the general rule that a declaration on a matter relating to a public or analogous right should not be made by consent. However, those cases considered that a declaration could be made if the Court was satisfied by evidence that it ought to be made, the \"evidence\" to which regard may be had, including \"facts\" admitted to be true about which there is no direct evidence --- facts, for example, contained in a statement of agreed facts. I am persuaded that the approach adopted in such cases as Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2004] NSWSC 836 ; (2004) 50 ACSR 500 , referred to by Finkelstein J at [16], provide useful guidance in this regard. I am therefore satisfied that it is appropriate in a case such as the present to make the declarations sought by the parties. The parties also consent to the making of injunctions. Injunctions granted pursuant to s 80 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) are in the nature of public interest injunctions. They are in a category different to and not subject to the same constraints as injunctions granted pursuant to the Court's equitable jurisdiction. As s 80(4) and (5) suggest, the Court has a wider jurisdiction to grant an injunction under s 80 than under the general law, although traditional principles of equity may not be irrelevant: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 850 ; (2003) 200 ALR 491 at [216] ; ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248. In ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd at 255, Lockhart J, with whom French J agreed, stated: Section 80 is essentially a public interest provision. Conduct of the kind proscribed by both Pts IV and V may be detrimental to the public interest because many persons can be affected and considerable loss or damage may be sustained by them. Injunctions can be made under s 80 if it is in the public interest to do so. The public interest may warrant the making of an injunction notwithstanding that the contravener is not likely to engage in the contravening conduct again: see Trade Practices Commission v Mobile Oil Australia Ltd [1984] FCA 363 ; (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 300, per Toohey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41 --- 811 at [32]. In this case, the proposed injunctions are in the public interest to reduce the risk that Cosic Holdings and Mr Cosic will engage in conduct in the future that would contravene Pt V , Div 1AAA of the Act, even though the Court is informed they are no longer engaged in the promotion of the Scheme. The admitted facts disclose a sufficient nexus between the conduct alleged and the orders sought: compare Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1987) 148 ALR 339. The respondents admit to engaging in conduct of the specific type referred to in the proposed injunctions. The injunctions are, in my view, sufficiently clearly stated to be capable of being complied with and do not require any additional supervision of the Court: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc. I am satisfied that the injunctions should go. The parties also request the Court to make orders pursuant to s 86C of the Act so that letters are sent to all Australian participants who were introduced to the Scheme by the respondents, advising them of the Court's judgment and the findings and the remedies granted; and also requiring the respondents to publish advertisements in named newspapers advising of this judgment, the findings and the relief granted. I am satisfied that these orders will inform participants of the Scheme and the general public about the outcome of the proceedings and in doing so will protect consumers and help to prevent further incidence of the conduct. The orders will also help to educate recipients of that information about features of pyramid selling Schemes and the prohibitions on such Schemes in Pt V of the Act. This is consistent with the purpose of s 86C, which is raising awareness of the type of conduct that may contravene the Act and the outcome of particular cases : see, in this regard, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v On Clinic Australia Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41 --- 517. I am advised that the ACCC has not sought an order requiring Mr Cosic to participate in a trade practices compliance program because it is informed that he is no longer involved in the Scheme nor in any business of a remotely similar nature to the Scheme. This was confirmed by counsel for the respondents and I act on this basis. I was further informed by counsel for the ACCC that this is not a case the ACCC considered should require any orders for compensation to be paid by the respondents to any other person. In cases such as this, the ACCC has discovered by experience that it is difficult to obtain any information concerning any loss suffered by persons who may have dealt with promoters such as the respondents of pyramid selling Schemes. I accept that regulatory experience and proceed on that basis in this case. CONCLUSION AND ORDERS For these reasons, I am satisfied that the consent orders proposed by the parties are appropriate and should be made. They properly reflect the public interest in the enforcement of the Trade Practices Act provisions governing pyramid selling Schemes. They also bring to an end, in an efficient and cost effective manner, these civil enforcement proceedings commenced by the ACCC. I certify that the preceding sixty-four (64) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Barker. Associate: Dated: 22 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr W Keane Solicitor for the Applicant: Corrs Chambers Westgarth Counsel for the Respondents: Mr S Butcher Solicitor for the Respondents: Dwyer Durack Date of Hearing: 8 December 2009 Date of Judgment: 8 December 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1579.html","title":"09_1579.txt","id":"7"},{"snippet":"This matter arises from strike action taken by employees of several contractors on 5, 6, 8, 24 and 25 June 2009 at a high rise building site at 915 Hay Street, Perth (Site) which is controlled by Diploma Constructions (WA) Pty Ltd (Diploma). In its substantive application filed in June 2009, the applicant (the ABCC) seeks relief in respect of alleged breaches by the respondents of s 38 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (BCII Act ), a civil penalty provision, which prohibits a person engaging in unlawful industrial action. On 29 September 2009 I delivered reasons for judgment in relation to the application by the ABCC for an interlocutory injunction to restrain the respondents from engaging in further unlawful industrial action in which I concluded that interlocutory relief ought be granted: Australian Building and Construction Commissioner v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 1092. At that time, however, I deferred making orders as the respondents indicated that they wished to be heard on the form of those orders. I heard the parties in this respect on 16 December 2009. The applicant seeks relief in terms that will restrain the respondents from unlawful conduct in respect to all building work being performed for Diploma throughout Western Australia. The central submission of the respondents is that the interlocutory relief ought be confined to restraining unlawful conduct at the Site. This is so, they submit, because the originating Application, properly construed, seeks relief only in relation to the Site. This turns on the definition of \"Diploma Workers\" in para 1 of the Application under which declarations of contravention are sought. The respondents correctly submit that a Court, in granting interlocutory injunctive relief, should generally grant the minimum relief necessary to do justice between the parties: Cardile v LED Builders Pty Ltd [1999] HCA 18 ; (1999) 198 CLR 380 at 409. The question then is what will achieve that result in this case between these parties. It is important, in this respect, to bear in mind that the applicant is not a private litigant. As I pointed out in my earlier reasons at [153]: The ABCC's application is made in the public interest of improving the building and construction industry under a statutory capacity to so apply. It is not in respect of any interference with any legal right of the ABCC. The legislature plainly conferred on the ABCC powers to obtain interlocutory injunctions, damages and penalties as instruments for effecting that improvement: ICI Operations [1992] FCA 474 ; 38 FCR 248 per French J at [268]. As I observed in CBI Construction Pty Ltd v Abbott (2008) 177 IR 134 at [22]: Consideration of the main object is a relevant consideration to the construction and application of the provisions of the BCII Act: United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399 at [23]-[25]; Cahill v Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2008] FCA 1292 at [50] - [51] . The source of power I identified in my reasons at [30]-[33] and [156] as sufficient for present purposes was s 49(1) and (3) of the BCII Act. As I said at [32]: The power to grant an injunction, including an interim injunction, under s 49 is additional to the Court's power under s 39 and, unlike the power in s 39, is not predicated on the Court's satisfaction that unlawful industrial action is occurring or is threatened, impending or probable. Rather, the Court may make any order \"that it considers appropriate\". The minimum relief necessary to do justice between the parties will equate to what is \"appropriate\". The question of what is appropriate also arises were the power sourced in s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). In Jackson v Sterling Industries Limited [1987] HCA 23 ; (1987) 162 CLR 612 at 622, Deane J said that: Section 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) confers upon the Federal Court a broad power to make orders of such kinds, including interlocutory orders, as it \"thinks appropriate\" . Wide though that power is, it is subject to both jurisdictional and other limits. It exists only \"in relation to matters\" in respect of which jurisdiction has been conferred upon the Federal Court. Even in relation to such matters, the power is restricted to the making of the \"kinds\" of order, whether final or interlocutory, which are capable of properly being seen as \"appropriate\" to be made by the Federal Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction [emphasis added]. The respondents submit that the relevant subject matter, in respect of which relief ought appropriately be granted, concerns only the actions of the respondents in relation to the 'Diploma Workers' as defined in the Application, who were required to perform building work at the Site. Further, the respondents submit that the only evidence concerning other Diploma sites adduced by the ABCC at the hearings on 17 and 20 July 2009 was from Mr Paul Day, project manager of the construction project at 915 Hay Street, Perth. Mr Day gave evidence by statement that he heard the third respondent, Mr Michael Buchan, say he was going to \"raise a petition for all of the Diploma sites with regards to general safety concerns and send it to John Norup (a Diploma Director)\". By contrast, Mr Buchan gave evidence by statement that it was Mr Wes Francis, the Diploma Site Manager, who suggested that there should be a petition when he (Buchan) was telling the meeting about \"issues\" on other Diploma sites. The ABCC submits that it is not germane whether it was Mr Francis or Mr Buchan who first suggested such a petition. What is significant, he submits, is that before the petition was mentioned by anyone, Mr Buchan had begun addressing issues on other sites, a matter which appears clearly from Mr Buchan's affidavit. Paragraphs 24 and 25 of his affidavit are in these terms: As I was telling the meeting about issues on other Diploma sites, Wes Francis, the Diploma site manager, suggested that we get a petition up. In respect of the rest of paragraph 15, it is correct to say that I was discussing issues , not just at Hay Street, but at other Diploma sites. (Emphasis added) This, the ABCC submits, evidences an implicit threat that there would be action of some sort on all or on other Diploma sites. As I said at [59] of my earlier reasons Mr Buchan did not expressly deny what he is alleged to have said but only that it was Mr Francis who (first) raised it. The respondents submit that, in any assessment of this evidence, neither version is anything more than a comment about raising a petition of complaint and that such comments, even if followed up with a petition, could never amount to unlawful industrial action on other sites, without more. They further contend that there was no evidence that such a petition was ever raised and that Mr Buchan was not cross-examined on the point. Accordingly, the respondents submit that extending the terms of the injunction to all building sites operated by Diploma is: (a) more than is just or appropriate; (b) more than the minimum relief necessary to do justice between the parties; (c) beyond the grant of remedies appropriate to the protection and enforcement of the right or subject-matter in issue as set out in the Application; (d) not supported by any evidence adduced by the applicant related to either a serious issue to be tried (because that is limited in the Application to the events at the Site), or the balance of convenience. Reasoning I do not consider that the Court is constrained by the language of the originating application. In any event, there is a basis for reading the Application in a more expansive way. The ABCC submits, concerning his Application under Part B that relief 1(a)(i) and (ii) applies to all sites for two reasons. First, he submits, the words are quite general and apply to workers failing or refusing to attend for building work or failing or refusing to perform any work after attending for building work, and placing a ban, limitation, restriction on the performance of building work adopted in connection with industrial dispute. Second, the ABCC submits that (a) is plainly intended to apply to all sites because of the contrast made between 1(a) on the one hand and 1(b) on the other hand. It is unnecessary for me to resolve this aspect of the parties' submissions as to the proper construction of the terms of the application. I do not regard the respondents' construction argument concerning the application, even if correct, as imposing a strait jacket on the court's wide discretionary powers to grant injunctive relief in light of the evidence and the findings which I have made. The appropriate relief to be granted should be fashioned against the principle of proportionality in achieving a fair result. The respondents placed reliance on the case of CBI Construction v Abbott 177 IR 134. There I said at [66]: While the power to grant an interim injunction under s 49(3) should be exercised having regard to the principles applied by a court of equity, the main object of the BCII Act is also relevant consideration in applying its provisions: United Group Infrastructure Pty Ltd v Automotive, Food, Metals, Engineering, Printing and Kindred Industries Union (2005) 148 IR 399 at [23]-[25]. The respondents submit that the application of ordinary equitable principles to the grant of a statutory injunction, in this case, requires that I take into account the interests of third parties and further that the ABCC ought proffer an undertaking as to damages. I do not accept this submission for the following reasons. First, the interests of third parties are not affected by the orders I propose to make which merely restrain the respondents from engaging in unlawful industrial action. Second, s 76 of the BCII Act provides relevantly that, in proceedings under s 49, as in this case, the Court cannot require the ABCC, as a condition of granting an interim injunction to give an undertaking as to damages. I regard the use of the word \"interim\" as referrable to any injunction granted prior to the final disposition of the substantive proceeding. The injunction here sought is, accordingly, an interim injunction. It follows that the ABCC does not have to provide nor can the Court require him to provide an undertaking as to damages. I will now turn to important findings I made in my earlier reasons. I rejected the respondents' claims, at the interlocutory hearing, that their conduct was justified or excused under s 36(1)(g)(i) of the BCII Act by reason that the industrial action was based on a reasonable concern by the employees about an imminent risk to health or safety. I said at [144]: The ABCC submits that I should find a prima facie case, by inference, that the real reasons why the strikes occurred were because Diploma involved the police in having Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan removed from the Site on 5 June 2009 and because they were a response to Diploma's actions taken, advice of which was given to CFMEU on 21 April 2009, that Mr McDonald would no longer be allowed access to the Site or to any Diploma Site and that, in order to gain Federal Accreditation Diploma would require adherence by the CFMEU to Diploma's Guidelines. These reasons may well have been the motivation behind the strikes. It is unnecessary that I form a view as to this even on a prima facie basis. It is enough that I have concluded that there is a prima facie case established by the ABCC that the respondents engaged in unlawful industrial action. Whatever the real reasons I am satisfied to the necessary degree that they had nothing to do with any reasonable concern as to any imminent danger to the health or safety of any employee on the Site . (Emphasis added) At [145] I added: It is of particular concern that the CFMEU, Mr McDonald and Mr Buchan have, as I have found on a prima facie basis, hidden behind spurious concerns as to the health and safety of employees to advance, as I infer, their own unspecified industrial aims. It is the very behaviour which the Commonwealth Parliament has made clear should be eradicated from the building industry in this country. It is conduct that directly undermines the main object of the BCII Act (s 3(1)) which is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work to ensure that building work is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and for the benefit of the Australian economy as a whole. (Emphasis added) Whilst I was not prepared to reach a view as to the precise reasons underlying the respondents' conduct, it involved, plainly enough, action directed against Diploma. That the action was taken at the Site was incidental. It could have been at any other Diploma site in Western Australia. The action taken was directed not at the Site, given my rejection of the respondents' claims made at the hearing of the interlocutory application for interim injunctive relief. No other reason was advanced by the respondents which confined their action to the Site. These findings place the evidence that Mr Buchan and Mr Day gave, concerning a petition in relation to safety issues at Diploma sites, in a particular context. I am not prepared to conclude, even provisionally, that any such alleged safety issues even existed in June 2009. It is a reasonable inference to draw then, as I do, that the target of the respondents action was Diploma itself and not matters peculiar to the Site. The relief ought then extend to any building work being performed for Diploma throughout Western Australia. This, in my opinion, is appropriate to do justice between the parties in relation to the findings I have made, on a prima facie basis, as to the true nature of the issues between them exposed by the evidence. I received minutes of proposed orders from both parties. In each case, proposed order 1(a) concerns the extent of the restraint to be imposed subject to certain lawful exceptions. The Respondents seek the inclusion of the words \" or action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to, in advance and in writing by or on behalf of employees of the employer \" in Order 1(a) for the sake of completeness. They submit that those are the words of section 36(1)(f) of the BCII Act, and constitute one of the statutory exceptions to what constitutes \"building industrial action\" in the BCII Act. The Applicant opposes the insertion of these words into Order 1(a) on the following grounds: 1. The purpose of Order 1(a) is to restrain the Respondents from organising or procuring industrial action; 2. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the employers have ever been (or are likely to be) involved in organising or procuring industrial action to be taken by employers against the members of the First Respondent or any other person who would normally be an employee; 3. For this reason, it is inappropriate and unnecessary for the terms of the injunction to be extended in the manner suggested. I accept the submission of the respondents that since the applicant only intends to enjoin unlawful conduct, and for the avoidance of any ambiguity, it is appropriate that the terms of the injunction precisely reflect the statutory scheme for unlawful conduct sought to be prohibited, together with all the exceptions to that definition which may constitute lawful conduct. I will make the following orders: 1. Until further determination of this application or until further order, each of the respondents (whether by their officers, delegates, agents, employees or other representatives) be restrained from: (a) being engaged in or involved in any contractor (and their employees) or employee who is required to perform building work for Diploma Constructions (WA) Pty Ltd (Diploma): (i) failing or refusing to attend for building work or failing or refusing to perform any work after attending for building work; or (ii) placing a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of building work adopted in connection with an industrial dispute, (together action) save and except in relation to action by any employee of a contractor or of Diploma, required to perform building work for Diploma if the action by the employee is authorised or agreed to, in advance and in writing, by the employer of the employee; or action by an employer that is authorised or agreed to, in advance and in writing, by or on behalf of employees of the employer; or action based on a reasonable concern held by the employee about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety and the employee did not unreasonably fail to comply with a direction of his or her employer to perform other available work, whether at the same or another workplace, that was safe to perform. (b) attending or organising or procuring any person or persons, to attend, within 100 metres of any entrance to the Diploma construction site located at 915 Hay Street, Perth, Western Australia, save for such entry to the site as may be authorised by law pursuant to the provisions of Part 3-4 of the Fair Work Act 2009 , for the purpose of using a public road for reasons unconnected with the said site or for the purpose of complying with these orders. (c) Costs reserved. I certify that the preceding thirty-five (35) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour. Associate: Dated: 23 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr K M Pettit (SC) with Mr S Harben Solicitor for the Applicant: Clayton Utz Counsel for the Respondents: Ms K A Vernon Solicitor for the Respondents: Slater & Gordon Date of Hearing: 16 December 2009 Date of Judgment: 23 December 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1587.html","title":"09_1587.txt","id":"8"},{"snippet":"This is an application to review a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (\"Tribunal\") dated 9 September 2009 made under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) (\"AAT Act\"). The sole ground of the application is that the Tribunal erred in law and committed a jurisdictional error in determining that it had jurisdiction to review a specific decision of the applicant. The applicant submits that, properly understood, that decision, made in respect of review application No AAT Q2009/1524, was not a decision to which the Tribunal has jurisdiction conferred by the AAT Act or any other Act. The applicant seeks the following relief pursuant to s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) and s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth): A writ of prohibition restraining the first respondent from proceeding to review application No AATQ2009/1524. A writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of the first respondent dated 9 September 2009, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to review application No AATQ2009/1524. A declaration that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to review application No AATQ2009/1524. Costs. Further, the applicant claims under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (\"ADJR Act\"): An order quashing or setting aside the decision of the first respondent dated 9 September 2009, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to review application No 2009/1524. A declaration that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to review application No 2009/1524. It is common ground between the parties that the Court has jurisdiction to determine this application pursuant to either s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) or the ADJR Act, and that the matter is amenable to the relief sought in the application. On the basis that the parties accept that the Court has jurisdiction to make the relief sought, I do not propose to consider the issue of jurisdiction further in this judgment. Summary In summary, the applicant contends that the Tribunal failed to correctly construe the relevant provisions of the Accreditation Grant Principles 1999 (Cth) (\"the Principles\") made pursuant to s 96-1 of the Aged Care Act 1997 (Cth) (\"the Act\"). More specifically, the applicant contends that, in summary: Section 7.1 of the Principles requires that, in order to be a \"reviewable decision\", a decision made under s 2.32 must be a \" Variation of the period for which residential care services is to be accredited\". The second respondent applied for a further period of accreditation under the Principles. The applicant decided to grant accreditation for a further two years. The second respondent applied to the applicant to reconsider the decision in respect of the length of the period of accreditation. The applicant affirmed the reconsidered decision in respect of the two years accreditation (in other words --- the applicant did not vary the period of accreditation on reconsideration). On application to the Tribunal for review of the reconsidered decision, the Tribunal held that the applicant had made a \"reviewable decision\" within the meaning of s 7.1 of the Principles because \"reviewable decision\" included a decision adopting or affirming the original decision. The applicant contends that the Tribunal was wrong in so holding. The second respondent contends that the Tribunal was correct in finding that the reconsidered decision was a \"reviewable decision\" within the meaning of s 7.1 , and that any other interpretation lends itself to producing an absurdity. Background The background facts to this application are found primarily in the affidavits of Mr Michael Palfrey, solicitor with Clayton Utz lawyers, the solicitors for the applicant, and Ms Victoria Crawford, General Manager Accreditation of the applicant. The background facts are not in dispute in these proceedings. The applicant is an independent company limited by guarantee. It is responsible for managing the accreditation and ongoing supervision of Commonwealth-funded aged care homes. The applicant's functions set out in the Principles include assessing and determining applications made by accredited residential care services that wish to be accredited for a further period. The applicant performs this function through, inter alia , conducting accreditation site audits and review audits which involve an assessment team visiting the service's premises to undertake a review of the quality of services. The team then presents to the applicant a Site Report with a recommendation as to whether the service should be accredited, and, if so, the period of accreditation. After receiving the Site Report the agency applicant then decide whether or not to accredit the service: s 2.27 of the Principles. If the decision is to accredit the service provider, the agency must determine the period of accreditation, or if already accredited, the further period of accreditation: s 2.28 of the Principles. The second respondent is an approved provider of residential aged care. It has a residential aged care facility at 9 Havana Street, Rowes Bay in Queensland (\"the facility\"). The facility has been accredited by the applicant since 27 February 2006. In response to an application for a further period of accreditation by the second respondent in January 2009 an assessment team of the applicant conducted a site audit of the facility between 20 and 22 January 2009 and provided the second respondent with a Site Audit Report. On 4 March 2009 the applicant made a decision (\"the original decision\") to accredit the second respondent, pursuant to s 2.27 and s 2.28 of the Principles, for two years from 30 March 2009 to 20 March 2011. It appears that the second respondent had expected to be accredited for three years. In practice the maximum period for which a service is accredited is three years (TS p 5 ll 46-47). On 10 March 2009 the second respondent applied to the applicant for reconsideration of the accreditation period pursuant to s 2.32(1) of the Principles. On 18 March 2009 the applicant made a further decision (\"the reconsideration decision\") namely: Not to vary the site audit decision. The home is accredited for two years. On 15 April 2009 the second respondent lodged application No AATQ2009/1524 with the Tribunal to review the reconsideration decision pursuant to s 7.2 of the Principles. Statutory scheme The statutory scheme is helpfully summarised in the decision of the Tribunal and submissions of both parties. In summary: The Act establishes that residential care subsidies are payable under Pt 3.1, to \"approved providers\" who, inter alia , meet accreditation requirements. \"Accreditation requirements\" are defined in Sch 1 to the Act to mean requirements set out in s 42-4 of the Act. Section 42-4(1) of the Act provides that a residential care service meets its accreditation requirement at all times during which there is in force an accreditation of the service by an accreditation body. The applicant is an accreditation body. Section 96-1 of the Act provides that the Minister may make, inter alia , Accreditation Grant Principles. These principles have been made (namely \"the Principles\" which I identified earlier in this judgment). Part 2 of the Principles provides for the accreditation of residential care services such as the Rowes Bay facility. Division 2 Pt 2 of the Principles provides for procedures for accreditation. Division 3 Pt 2 of the Principles provides for the procedures for the assessment of applications for accreditation. A decision by an accreditation body to accredit or not to accredit is made pursuant to s 2.27 of the Principles. If the decision is to accredit, the period of accreditation must also be decided pursuant to s 2.28 of the Principles. Section 2.32 of the Principles allows an applicant for accreditation to apply for reconsideration of the period for which the service is to be accredited. Specifically the section provides: (1) The applicant may, within 7 days after being told about a decision to accredit the residential care service, give to the accreditation body a written request to reconsider the period mentioned in paragraph 2.29(2)(a). (2) The accreditation body must, within 7 days of receiving a request: (a) decide whether or not to vary the period; and (b) tell the applicant, in writing, about its decision. (3) If the decision is to vary the period, the accreditation body must also give the applicant a replacement certificate setting out the revised period for which the service is to be accredited. Section 7.2 of the Principles provides that an application may be made to the Tribunal for review of a reviewable decision A table in s 7.1 of the Principles sets out a table of \"reviewable decisions\" as follows: 7.1 What is a reviewable decision Each of the following decisions of the accreditation body is a reviewable decision : Item Decision Section under which decision is made 2 Variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited 2.32 3 Refusal of an application on reconsideration 2.38 4 Refusal to include an applicant's nominated assessor in an assessment team 2.44 5 Refusal to accept an applicant's objection to a quality assessor 2.45 6 Revocation of an accreditation 3.15 and 3.24 7 Variation of a period of accreditation 3.15 and 3.24 8 Refusal of an application to review registrar's decision to remove from register 8.6 Decision of the Tribunal ([2009] AATA 684) The Tribunal considered the primary contention of the applicant, namely that a decision not to vary the period of accreditation determined in the original decision was not itself a reviewable decision because it was not a \" variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" within the meaning of s 7.1 of the Principles. The Tribunal considered that if the applicant's interpretation was correct, an adverse decision regarding the period of accreditation (for example, a decision to accredit for a shorter period) which was subsequently affirmed in the course of an internal review process was practically unreviewable by the Tribunal (at [7]). Importantly the Tribunal continued: 10. While the outcome contended for by the agency may surprise at first glance, the agency suggests it is not unusual when one has regard to the operation of the Principles. The agency's written submissions dated 17 July 2009 point out that a reviewable decision made under s 3.24 would be subject to the same objection if the reviewable decision affirmed what had already been decided at first instance. The Tribunal would only have the power to deal with the outcome of the reconsideration if the reconsideration varied what had already been decided. As I understand it, the agency is arguing that the legislative scheme has intentionally created an administrative regime in which an adverse decision can only be reviewed once. If it is unchanged upon review --- even if that review is an internal review, rather than an independent review conducted by the Tribunal --- that is the end of the matter. 11. I accept that the interpretation contended for by the agency is open upon a plain reading of the words of the Principles. It is arguably the most obvious interpretation of what is written. But it does seem to be at odds with the purposes of the legislative scheme. That scheme has created an accreditation process that is administered by a private organisation. It is no surprise in the circumstances that the Principles should provide for appeal rights in respect of decisions of the agency which go to questions of accreditation. The scheme contemplates an internal reconsideration of a decision as the first step in the appeal process, but did the Parliament intend that the process should end there if the internal review affirmed what had already been decided? The answer to that question appears to depend on the nature of a reviewable decision under the Principles. 12. A reviewable decision is, first and foremost, the product of a review of the original decision. But that review is not simply a reconsideration of the process that was undertaken at first instance. The Principles appear to contemplate the agency starting afresh and reviewing all of the material on reconsideration with a view to reaching a fresh decision as to what should be done. A perusal of the text of the reconsideration decision in this case confirms that is what occurred here. Where, as here, the agency decides on reconsideration of that material that the original decision to change the accreditation period was right, it is effectively adopting the decision that the period of accreditation be varied from what it was before the original decision. The outcome of the reconsideration decision is, in a practical sense, a variation rather than an affirmation. To treat it as anything else would be to prefer an overly restrictive interpretation of the words in the Principles that appears to defeat the intentions of the legislative scheme. That scheme favours meaningful administrative review of the private agency's decisions. Accordingly the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine application No AATQ2009/1524. Submissions of the parties Both written and oral submissions of the parties in this case were helpful and clear. In summary, the applicant submitted as follows: In reply, the second respondent submitted in summary: The Court should adopt a broader, contextual interpretation of the right of review conferred by s 7.1, so as to confer such a right in respect of all decisions made under section regardless of the outcome. The focus thus becomes the fact that there has been the exercise of the statutory function, rather than its outcome. The statutory scheme is to provide rights of external review of decisions made in the exercise of certain powers under the Principles. In essence, rights of review are conferred under s 7.1 where the statutory function is exercised in such a way as to cause the person affected by the decision dissatisfaction. On the construction contended by the applicant, if on reconsideration the accreditation body decided to vary the accreditation period, either upward or downward, by a single day, an approved provider could choose to have that decision reviewed on its merits by the Tribunal. However if the accreditation body decided that the period of accreditation should remain precisely the same, no appeal lies. The substantive statutory function exercised in the making of a decision under s 2.32(2)(a) is \"whether or not to vary the period\". Accordingly, it is clear that the expression \"Variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" as used in item 2 of the table in s 7.1 of the Principles is a shorthand method of describing the nature of the decision to be made under s 2.32 in response to an application for reconsideration of the period of accreditation (namely whether or not to vary). A number of the decisions set out in s 7.1 leave the status quo unchanged, yet confer rights of review. It is appropriate for the Court to give effect to the legislative intent where the result otherwise would be absurd, extraordinary, capricious, irrational or obscure. In its decision, the Tribunal strove for an interpretation which would not promote absurdity. Consideration In these proceedings there is, in essence, only one question of substance for decision. Does \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" within the meaning of s 7.1 of the principles and by reference to s 2.32 of the Principles, include a decision to confirm the period for which residential care service is to be accredited? If the answer to this question is no, the applicant will be successful in its appeal. In my view the answer to the question is reached in two stages, namely: Considering the natural meaning of \"variation\"; and Considering the meaning of the phrase \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" in the broader context of the statutory framework. 1. Natural meaning of \"variation\" The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd edition) defines \"variation\" as follows: I. Difference, divergence, or discrepancy between two or more things or persons II. 1. The fact of varying in condition, character, degree, or other quality; the fact of undergoing modification or alteration, esp within certain limits b . The action of making some change or alteration. \"Vary\" in turn is defined as: 1. Of things: To undergo change or alteration; to pass from one condition, state, etc., to another... 2. To differ, to exhibit or present divergence, from something else. The fact that \"vary\" imports the notion of change in some form has also been endorsed by Courts in different contexts. I note, for example, the following comment of Andrews J in The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone (1906) 2 IrR 164 at 170: The Court of Quarter Sessions, it will be observed, is empowered, on hearing the appeal, to confirm, vary or reverse the order appealed against. I think each of these three words has a separate and appropriate meaning. \"Confirm\" requires no explanation; \"vary\" in my opinion, means alter in part , as distinguished from discharging the entire order appealed against , and making a wholly different one; and \"reverse\", in my opinion, imports more than discharge , and means \" changed to the contrary \". (emphasis in original) In R v Industrial Court (S.A.); ex parte Mount Gunson Mines Pty Ltd (1982) 2 I.R 336 at 340, after considering The King (Conway) v Justices of The County Tyrone Mitchell J (King CJ and White J agreeing) observed: The dictionary meaning does not accord with that given by Andrews J in that there is no suggestion that the change or alteration must be a change or alteration only in part . The common theme in both the dictionary and judicial commentary is that plain meaning of \"variation\" entails an alteration of some kind. To that extent, \"variation\" is distinguishable in that sense from \"confirmation\", which entails preservation of the status quo. 2. The context in which the phrase appears in section 7.1 The more complex question however is whether, in the broader context of the statutory scheme, \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" includes a decision by the applicant not to vary its previous decision. Plain meaning of words There is little doubt that \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" means, prima facie , circumstances where there is a change to the period for which a residential care service is to be accredited. At first blush, the proposition that this includes a decision not to vary an earlier decision appears absurd. There is long tradition of Courts assuming that Parliament, through the enactment of legislation, intends what is enacted. As Lord Atkinson said in Vacher & Sons Ltd v London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; [1913] AC 107 at 121-122: If the language of a statute is plain, admitting of only one meaning, the Legislature must be taken to have meant and intended what it has plainly expressed, and whatever it has in clear terms enacted must be enforced though it should lead to absurd or mischievous results. If the language of this sub-section be not controlled by some of the other provisions of the statute, it must, since its language is plain and unambiguous, be enforced, and your Lordships' House sitting judicially is not concerned with the question whether the policy it embodies is wise or unwise, or whether it leads to consequences just or unjust, beneficial or mischievous. More recently the High Court in Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1981] HCA 26 ; (1981) 147 CLR 297 considered the risks in imputing meaning to a legislative provision, which meaning is not apparent on the face of the provision. As Gibbs CJ said (at 304-305): It is an elementary and fundamental principle that the object of the court, in interpreting a statute, \"is to see what is the intention expressed by the words used\": River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson (1877) 2 App Cas 743 , at p 763. It is only by considering the meaning of the words used by the legislature that the court can ascertain its intention. And it is not unduly pedantic to begin with the assumption that words mean what they say: cf. Cody v. J. H. Nelson Pty. Ltd . [1947] HCA 17 ; (1947) 74 CLR 629 , at p 648. Of course, no part of a statute can be considered in isolation from its context - the whole must be considered. If, when the section in question is read as part of the whole instrument, its meaning is clear and unambiguous, generally speaking \"nothing remains but to give effect to the generally speaking \"nothing remains but to give effect to the unqualified, words\": Metropolitan Gas Co. v. Federated Gas Employees' Industrial Union [1925] HCA 5 ; (1925) 35 CLR 449 , at p 455 There are cases where the result of giving words their ordinary meaning may be so irrational that the court is forced to the conclusion that the draftsman has made a mistake, and the canons of construction are not so rigid as to prevent a realistic solution in such a case: see per Lord Reid in Connaught Fur Trimmings Ltd. v. Cramas Properties Ltd . [1965] 1 WLR 892 , at p 899; (1965) 2 ALL ER 382 , at p 386. Examples of that sort of case may be found in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes , 12th ed., (1969), at p. 228 et seq., and Craies on Statute Law, 7th ed., (1971), at p. 520 et seq. However, if the language of a statutory provision is clear and unambiguous, and is consistent and harmonious with the other provisions of the enactment, and can be intelligibly applied to the subject matter with which it deals, it must be given its ordinary and grammatical meaning, even if it leads to a result that may seem inconvenient or unjust. To say this is not to insist on too literal an interpretation, or to deny that the court should seek the real intention of the legislature. The danger that lies in departing from the ordinary meaning of unambiguous provisions is that \"it may degrade into mere judicial criticism of the propriety of the acts of the Legislature\", as Lord Moulton said in Vacher & Sons Ltd. v. London Society of Compositors [1912] UKHL 3 ; (1913) AC 107 , at p 130; it may lead judges to put their own ideas of justice or social policy in place of the words of the statute. On the other hand, if two constructions are open, the court will obviously prefer that which will avoid what it considers to be inconvenience or injustice. Since language, read in its context, very often proves to be ambiguous, this last mentioned rule is one that not infrequently falls to be applied. Similarly, Aickin J observed (at 336-337): In Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd . [1978] 1 WLR 231 ; (1978) 1 All ER 948 , five members of the House of Lords dealt with this question and although their speeches differ in emphasis they were united in declining to read words into the Act there in question. Viscount Dilhorne, with whom Lord Fraser of Tullybelton agreed, said [1978] 1 WLR, at pp 234-235; (1978) 1 All ER, at p 951: It is now fashionable to talk of a purposive construction of a statute, but it has been recognised since the 17th century that it is the task of the judiciary in interpreting an Act to seek to interpret it \"according to the intent of them that made it\" (Coke 4 Inst. 330). If it were the case that it appeared that an Act might have been better drafted, or that amendment to it might be less productive of anomalies, it is not open to the court to remedy the defect. That must be left to the Legislature. The appellants contend that in view of the anomalies which they say would result from the interpretation the respondent seeks to have placed on the paragraph, to have paragraph 8(2) read as if it said: \"who also took part and at the date of the dismissal were taking part in that action\". As Stephenson L.J. said in the Court of Appeal, the paragraph does not so provide. \"It is a strong thing to read into an Act of Parliament words which are not there, and in the absence of clear necessity it is a wrong thing to do\" said Lord Mersey in Thompson v. Goold & Co. (1910) AC 409, at p 420. \". . . we are not entitled to read words into an Act of Parliament unless clear reason for it is to be found within the four corners of the Act itself\" said Lord Loreburn L.C. in Vickers, Sons & Maxim Ltd. v. Evans (1910) AC 444 , at p 445. Lord Simon of Glaisdale agreed with Viscount Dilhorne but added some further observations. After referring to the rule in Heydon's Case [1584] EngR 9 ; (1584) 3 Co Rep 7a , (76 ER 637) his Lordship said [1978] 1 WLR, at p 236; (1978) 1 All ER, at p 953: \"The final task of construction is still, as always, to ascertain the meaning of what the draftsman has said, rather than to ascertain what the draftsman meant to say. But if the draftsmanship is correct these should coincide. So if the words are capable of more than one meaning it is a perfectly legitimate intermediate step in construction to choose between potential meanings by various tests (statutory, objective, anomaly, etc.) which throw light on what the draftsman meant to say. \" At 338-339 Aickin J also endorsed comments of Lord Scarman in Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton) Ltd . [1978] 1 WLR 231 at 239 where his Lordship said: If the words used by Parliament are plain, there is no room for the \"anomalies\" test, unless the consequences are so absurd that, without going outside the statute, one can see that Parliament must have made a drafting mistake. If words \"have been inadvertently used\", it is legitimate for the court to substitute what is apt to avoid the intention of the legislature being defeated: per MacKinnon L.J. in Sutherland Publishing Co. Ltd. v. Caxton Publishing Co. Ltd . [1938] Ch 174 , at p 201 . This is an acceptable exception to the general rule that plain language excludes a consideration of anomalies, i.e. mischievous or absurd consequences. If a study of the statute as a whole leads inexorably to the conclusion that Parliament has erred in its choice of words, e.g. used \"and\" when \"or\" was clearly intended, the courts can, and must, eliminate the error by interpretation. But mere \"manifest absurdity\" is not enough: it must be an error (of commission or omission) which in its context defeats the intention of the Act. Turning now to the terms of item 2 in the table in s 7.1 of the Principles, I consider that the meaning of the words \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" is plain. There is no ambiguity to warrant further exploration in an attempt to identify the intention of Parliament. The intention of Parliament appears clearly in the words used --- a reconsideration decision is reviewable when the accreditation body varies (either up or down) the period for which a residential care service is to be accredited. A reconsideration decision where the accreditation body simply confirms its original decision in relation to the period of accreditation is not a decision which \"varies\" that period --- and it is not reviewable. To read into \"variation\" a meaning which includes \" no variation\" strikes me as absurd, and in stark contradiction to the specific language of s 7.1. The second respondent submitted that an interpretation which excludes review of a reconsideration decision which merely confirms the original decision of the applicant is potentially artificial and irrational. However an interpretation the result of which is surprising, even illogical, does not mean that that interpretation is not sound or that Parliament did not intend that outcome. The second respondent also submitted that the decisions listed in the second column of the table in s 7.1 of the Principles were actually a \"shorthand\" description of decisions made under the corresponding sections identified in the first column of the table and, in that respect, strict reliance could not be placed on the language used in the second column of the table. As Mr Horneman-Wren submitted, the tabular format of s 7.1 does not always strictly use the wording of the provisions within the various sections, thus requiring a person construing the section to look beyond those words. This point is illustrated by reference to the other items listed in the table in s 7.1. So: Paragraph 2.38 of the Principles is headed \"Decision on reconsideration\", and so far as relevant provides that: (1) The accreditation body must, after considering an application for reconsideration, decide: (a) to accredit the service; or (b) not to accredit the service ... (3) If the accreditation body decides to accredit a residential care service, the accreditation body must decide: (a) the period for which the service is to be accredited; and (b) whether there are any matters in respect of which improvements must be made to improve its compliance with the Accreditation Standards; and (c) the form and frequency of support contacts with the service ... However item 3 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 2.38 and describes the reviewable decision as \"Refusal of an application on reconsideration\". Paragraph 2.44 of the Principles is headed \"Accreditation body may refuse to include nominee\", and so far as relevant in subs (1) provides that: The accreditation body may refuse to include in an assessment team a quality assessor nominated by the applicant if the assessor is not eligible for inclusion in the team under subsection 2.45 (1),(2),(3), or (4). However item 4 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 2.44 and describes the reviewable decision as \"Refusal to include an applicant's nominated assessor in an assessment team\". Paragraph 2.45 of the Principles is headed \"Eligibility for assessment team\", and so far as relevant provides that: (1)Each member of an assessment team must be a registered quality assessor ... ... (5) The applicant may, in writing, within 14 days after being told under subsection 2.42 (5) who is in the team, object to a quality assessor in the team because the assessor is not eligible for inclusion in the team under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4). (6) If an applicant makes an objection for subsection (5), the accreditation body must decide to: (a) accept the objection and create a new assessment team; or (b) reject the objection. However item 5 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 2.45 and describes the reviewable decision as \"Refusal to accept an applicant's objection to a quality assessor\". Paragraph 3.15 and para 3.24 of the Principles are both headed \"Decision about review audit\" and so far as relevant in subs (1) provide that: The accreditation body may decide: (a) to vary the period of accreditation; or (b) to revoke the accreditation of the service; or (c) not to revoke the accreditation. However item 6 of the table in s 7.1 refers to these sections and describes the reviewable decision as \"Revocation of an accreditation\". Similarly item 7 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 3.15 and s 3.24 of the Principles and describes the reviewable decision as \"Variation of a period of accreditation\". Paragraph 8.6 of the Principles is headed \"Decision on application\" and so far as relevant in subs (1) provides that: (1) The accreditation body must decide whether to grant or refuse the person's application within 28 days after receiving it. However item 8 of the table in s 7.1 refers to s 8.6 and describes the reviewable decision as \"Refusal of an application to review registrar's decision to remove from register\". While it is feasible that the words in the second column of the table in s 7.1 are merely intended to act as an abridged reference to the section identified in the third column, in my view this proposition does not withstand close scrutiny. The better view is that the words in the second column of the table, including the words \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" have independent significance. I consider that the words in the second column describe the actual decision which is reviewable, and the reference to the section in the third column is a reference to the section pursuant to which the specific reviewable decision is made. So, for example: I agree with Mr Bickford for the applicant that, despite the arguably inelegant drafting, the second column in the table in s 7.1 actually describes the reviewable decision and is not mere \"shorthand\". For this reason alone, in my view the decision of the Tribunal cannot be sustained and the appeal should be allowed. However in the event that I am wrong in this finding, and also in deference to the thorough and well-reasoned submissions of the second respondent, I now turn to consider whether, in the context of the legislation (including the Principles), the phrase \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" in s 7.1 of the Principles bears the interpretation contended by the second respondent. Broader context First, I note that it is common ground that no assistance can be gleaned from explanatory memoranda or speeches in Parliament as to the meaning of the phrase \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" in s 7.1 (TS p 5 ll 7-14). Accordingly, it is necessary to turn to the relevant legislative instrument itself, namely the Principles, in order to identify whether the decision of the applicant falls within the meaning of \"variation of period for which residential care service is to be accredited\" and is thus a reviewable decision for the purpose of the Principles. Second, a key pillar of the second respondent's case is that the statutory scheme provides for external review of decisions made in the exercise of certain powers under the Principles. The second respondent submitted that, in each instance in which a right of review is conferred under s 7.1, the review available extends to those aspects of the exercise of the statutory function in such a way as to cause the person affected by the decision residual dissatisfaction . A number of the decisions set out in s 7.1 leave the status quo unchanged, but confer rights of review. In fact in a number of cases it is the fact that the status quo has not changed which gives rise to a right of review. Accordingly, the right of review conferred by item 2 of s 7.1 should be construed in the same way. In my view the interpretation of s 7.1 suggested by this line of reasoning is credible. However after considering submissions of both parties I am not persuaded that I should so construe item 2 of s 7.1. I have formed this view for the following reasons: In my view, it does not therefore follow that this means that any decision of the applicant pursuant to s 2.32 with which an applicant for accreditation is dissatisfied is reviewable by the Tribunal. Finally, while I note the submission of the second respondent concerning to the possibility of a reconsideration decision whereby the accreditation period of a residential care facility is varied upward or downward by a single day, I am not persuaded that the interpretation of s 7.1 should be resolved by an apprehension of extreme examples and distorting possibilities (cf Singh v Commonwealth [2004] HCA 43 ; (2004) 222 CLR 322 at [155] , Forge v ASIC [2006] HCA 44 ; (2006) 229 ALR 223 at [46] , New South Wales v Commonwealth [2006] HCA 52 ; (2006) 231 ALR 1 at [188] ). Conclusion In my view the appeal should be allowed. I certify that the preceding forty-seven (47) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier. Associate: Dated: 16 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr P Bickford and Ms A Wheatley Solicitor for the Applicant: Clayton Utz Counsel for the First Respondent: The First Respondents did not appear Counsel for the Second Respondent: Mr A Horneman-Wren Solicitor for the Second Respondent: McCullough Robertson Date of Hearing: 10 November 2009 Date of Judgment: 17 December 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1514.html","title":"09_1514.txt","id":"9"},{"snippet":"The applicant is an inspector appointed pursuant to s 57 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (the \"BCII Act\"). The first respondent was an officer and/or employee and/or duly authorized agent of the third respondent acting in the capacity of organizer. In the application the applicant appears to have misspelt the first respondent's surname name as \"Nisbet\". The correct spelling \"Nesbit\" is reflected in the respondent's amended defence. I give the applicant leave to amend the application to correct this error and direct it accordingly. The third respondent is an industrial association for the purposes of the BCII Act. The second respondent was dismissed from the proceedings prior to the hearing. The applicant seeks declaratory relief and the imposition of pecuniary penalties upon the first and third respondents in connection with conduct which allegedly occurred on 23 June 2008. The parties have filed an agreed statement of facts concerning this matter which I attach to these reasons as Annexure A. Section 44 of the BCII Act provides: (1) A person must not: (a) take or threaten to take any action; or (b) refrain or threaten to refrain from taking any action; with intent to coerce another person, or with intent to apply undue pressure to another person, to agree, or not to agree: (c) to make, vary or terminate, or extend the nominal expiry date of, a building enterprise agreement; or (d) to approve any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c). (2) Subsection (1) does not apply to action that is protected industrial action (as affected by Part 3 of Chapter 5 of this Act). (3) An employer must not coerce, or attempt to coerce, an employee of the employer in relation to who is to be, or is not to be, the employee's bargaining representative. (4) An employer must not apply, or attempt to apply, undue pressure to an employee of the employer in relation to who is to be, or is not to be, the employee's bargaining representative. (5) To the extent that section 343 of the FW Act relates to: (a) the making, varying or terminating of an enterprise agreement; or (b) the appointment, or termination of appointment, of a bargaining representative for an enterprise agreement; that section does not apply if the agreement is a building enterprise agreement. I do not understand the respondents to oppose the making of an appropriate declaration. I am informed that the maximum penalty in the case of the first respondent is $22,000 and in the case of the third respondent, $110,000. The applicant submits that taking all factors into account the appropriate penalty for each of the first and third respondents is \"in the vicinity of the upper end of the mid-range of potential penalties\". The respondents submit that in the case of the first respondent the appropriate penalty is in the range $8,000-$10,000 and in the case of the third respondent, $15,000-$20,000. The first respondent was employed as an organizer from 7 June 1999 until 24 February 2009, during which period he was responsible for a number of industries including the shop fitting industry. He had been responsible for that industry since about 2006. The affidavit by Mr Close filed on 7 August 2009 discloses that shortly after the visit on 23 June 2008 referred to in the statement of facts, he was informed that there had been an \"incident\". Mr Close was informed that: There was a nasty argument that took place between Tim and Stan. His daughter was involved in the argument and there was a fair bit of foul language used. In addition to this there is a long lists of safety concerns at the factory that were noted and advised to Stan. Subsequently Mr Close learnt that the Australian Building Construction Commission (the \"ABCC\") was investigating the incident. As a result, he attended with the first respondent at Budget Shopfitters' premises in order to see if the matter could be resolved. At one stage Mr Lewis told Mr Close that matters had become \"quite ugly\" and that both parties were \"quite aggressive\". Certain safety issues were discussed, and there was then an inspection. Mr Close considered that many of the safety matters about which concerns had previously been raised had been remedied. The meeting on that day ended amicably. I proceed upon the basis that when Mr Close became aware that the incident was being investigated, he took steps to resolve any continuing difficulties. I also proceed upon the basis that although there may have been some safety issues requiring attention, the relevant threats were substantially motivated by broader industrial considerations. The first respondent's threats involved threatened abuse of power in order to cause ongoing disruption to Budget Shopfitters' business undertaking through industrial action, and to compel the expenditure of substantial amounts of money. The first respondent's refusal to provide a list of the alleged safety issues suggests that much of his conduct was not motivated by concerns about those matters. Similarly, his assertion that he would \"find something\" was an assertion of an intention to abuse his position and the power of his union. The matter is curious in that it is unclear why the first respondent should have chosen to behave in this way on this particular occasion. Mr Close thought it to be quite out of character. One infers from some of the things which were said that his attitude may have been partly the product of what might be described as the \"cultural war\" associated with the industrial policy of the previous federal government and the changes which have been made under the present government. Of course I make no comment as to the correctness or appropriateness of either approach to industrial relations. The first respondent has no record of previous contraventions of the Act or the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (the \"WR Act\"). In those circumstances he may be treated upon the basis that this incident was a one-off lapse, to some extent out of character. However the conduct was quite extreme and completely unacceptable. The Court must demonstrate its disapproval of that conduct by fixing a penalty which will operate as a deterrent to others. There is no real suggestion that the first respondent expressed any remorse for his conduct at the time, although he has participated in the resolution of the matter and must be given credit for that, particularly for the fact that it has resulted in the avoidance of the need for a lengthy trial. The first respondent has left the third respondent's employ. It seems that he is no longer involved in the industrial relations field. Given that there was no previous misconduct of this kind, and that the relevant incident occurred on one discrete occasion, I am inclined to think that a penalty in excess of half of the maximum would be difficult to justify, even having regard to the seriousness of this particular conduct. The respondents suggest a range of $8,000-$10,000. I accept that submission. I fix the penalty at $9,000. As to the third respondent, a great deal of attention has been paid by the applicant to previous occasions on which unlawful conduct has been demonstrated, going back to 2003. Whilst such a record is no doubt relevant, two points must be kept in mind. First, many of the earlier events related to actions in other states. The union seems to operate through a series of semi-autonomous state organizations across the country. It may be that the record of one state branch is better than that of another. This fact may be relevant to the weight attributable to prior misconduct. Similar considerations might be taken into account in considering the previous misconduct of an employer corporation which operates through semi-autonomous branches. The second consideration is that any organization will, over a period of time, acquire a history, good or bad. The dynamics within a particular organization, which may produce misconduct at one point in time, may not be present at some other time. One should be cautious about inferring that a long history of misconduct, going back over many years, necessarily reflects the current mindset of the organization. Nonetheless the third respondent has a history of infringement of industrial legislation, including some infringements in Queensland. On the other hand, in this case, the conduct for which it is responsible, namely that of the first respondent, seems to have been out of character for him, and therefore not reasonably predictable. However as an employer itself, it was for the third respondent to ensure that clear guidelines were provided to its officers and reinforced so as to ensure that such behaviour did not occur. The third respondent cannot be treated as being innocent of previous infringements. The seriousness of the allegations cannot be overlooked. Further, when dealing with corporate employers or unions it is generally the case that only a substantial financial penalty is likely to have any deterrent effect. Loss will generally be borne by a relatively large number of people, so that perhaps none will actually feel any part of it. However it is also clear that the third respondent took steps to remedy the situation and has also cooperated in bringing the matter to a speedy and relatively economical conclusion. In the circumstances I consider that a penalty roughly equivalent to that imposed upon the first respondent, but reflecting the difference in maximum penalties, is appropriate. I fix the penalty at $40,000. I have been referred to the penalties imposed in numerous cases. However many were pursuant to the WR Act which provided for significantly lower maximum penalties. The penalties which I have imposed are generally consistent with those imposed by Jessup J in Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (No 2) [2009] FCA 548. The conduct in that case was somewhat more serious than in this. However the penalties for individual breaches were reduced to reflect the overall extent of the misconduct. I will make declarations in terms of paras 48 and 49 of the applicant's submissions as follows: Upon the admissions which the respondents made in the amended defence filed on 7 July 2009 and agreed statement of facts filed on 29 July 2009, it is declared that: (a) On 23 June 2008, [the first respondent] contravened section 44(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) by asking an employer to: (i) terminate its current workplace agreement; and (ii) enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU; (iii) on the basis that if the employer did not do so, the employer would be: (A) banned from building sites across Australia; and (B) subjected to a workplace health and safety audit which would result in the employer spending a significant amount of money, at least $30,000, in that [the first respondent] intended to coerce the employer to terminate its existing workplace agreement and enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU. (b) On 23 June 2008, the CFMEU contravened section 44(1) of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) by virtue of the conduct of its officer, Tim Nesbit, in asking an employer to: (i) terminate its current workplace agreement; and (ii) enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU; (iii) on the basis that if the employer did not do so, the employer would be: (A) banned from building sites across Australia; and (B) subjected to a workplace health and safety audit which would result in the employer spending a significant amount of money, at least $30,000, in that [the first respondent] intended to coerce the employer to terminate its existing workplace agreement and enter into a new workplace agreement with the CFMEU. I order that the first respondent pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty fixed at $9,000. I further order that the third respondent pay to the Commonwealth of Australia a pecuniary penalty fixed at $40,000. I certify that the preceding fourteen (14) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett. Associate: Dated: 23 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr CJ Murdoch Solicitor for the Applicant: Deacons Counsel for the First and Third Respondents: Mr DR Kent Solicitor for the First and Third Respondents: Hall Payne Lawyers Date of Hearing: 18 September 2009 Date of Judgment: 23 December 2009 Annexure \"A\" AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1574.html","title":"09_1574.txt","id":"10"},{"snippet":"This dispute raises a novel question about the interaction of the undertaking given by a plaintiff under r 41 of the Admiralty Rules 1988 (Cth) to pay to the Marshal money in respect of his costs and expenses of arresting a ship with the undertaken given under r 53 by an applicant for release of the ship to pay the costs and expenses of the Marshal in relation to the custody of the ship while under arrest. Here, both the plaintiff, EMAS Offshore Pte Ltd, and the defendant, APC Marine Pty Ltd, which was the owner of the barge that had been arrested, the \" APC Aussie 1\" , paid the Marshal the whole of the costs and expenses he had incurred. Thus, he held twice as much as he needed. Both parties rely in differing ways on the payment by the other. THE DEMANDS MADE BY THE MARSHAL IN RESPECT OF COSTS AND EXPENSES On 31 July 2009, I refused EMAS leave to amend to add a wholly new claim that had arisen after T-D Joint Venture Pty Limited had ceased to be a relevant person following termination of its charter of the \" APC Aussie 1 \": EMAS Offshore Pte Ltd v The Ship \"Aussie 1\" (2009) 258 ALR 454. APC paid $1,439,601.05 into Court in order to secure the release of the barge. At the same time, APC filed an application to Court for release of ship or other security under r 52(1) of the Admiralty Rules , being in form 19 prescribed under the Rules. In the form 19, APC was named as applicant and owner of the barge. The grounds on which the release was sought were described as: \"Payment of the amount claimed by the Plaintiff (including interest and costs) in the sum of $1,439.601.05 into Court as security for the plaintiff's claim in the proceedings. \" In addition, the form 19 contained a statement that APC had telegraphically transferred the amount of $92,100 into the Marshal's Fund: \"... for the costs and expenses of the Marshal in relation to the custody of the ship, ' APC Aussie 1 ', while under arrest, including the costs and expenses associated with the release of that ship. \" On 30 June 2009, EMAS, a Singaporean company, had paid $5,000 in answer to the initial demand of the Marshal for his costs and expenses of the arrest. On 30 July 2009 EMAS met a second demand by the Marshal for a further $60,000 and soon after, paid a further $35,000 to meet a subsequent demand of the Marshal. The total of the Marshal's costs and expenses, exclusive of goods and services tax was $91,673.63. Thus, at about the time of the release on 31 July 2009 and immediately after, the Marshal held $192,100 in respect of the total of his costs and expenses incurred during the period that the barge was under arrest. APC PAYS A FURTHER $25,000 IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN COSTS In addition, APC explained in an affidavit by Scott Chesterman, its solicitor, filed at the time at which the release from arrest was sought, that an amount of $25,000 had been included in the sum paid into Court as \"costs of arrest and release\". APC asserted that this was a payment in respect of the Marshal's costs. I do not accept that characterisation of the $25,000. Having regard to Mr Chesterman's explanation, it was a payment of security made in respect of APC's potential liability for the costs that EMAS might recover as its costs in the proceedings. The $25,000 amount was the only portion of the total sum paid into Court by APC that could represent security for its liability for EMAS' legal costs of the proceedings. EMAS by then had obtained the arrest, incurred legal costs in respect of the arrest, the proceedings against the barge and then against APC, after it entered an appearance. Thus, I am satisfied that the $25,000 represented a payment of security for EMAS' potential entitlement to an order for its taxable costs of the arrest and release quite apart from whatever amounts EMAS had had to pay to the Marshal in respect of his costs and expenses. THE PRESENT CLAIMS EMAS argued that the form 19, lodged by APC to secure the barge's release, identified the only purpose for which APC had paid the $92,100, namely to meet the Marshal's costs and expenses in connection with the custody of the barge while it was under arrest, including its release. On the other hand, APC argued that the money should be held as security for what it might ultimately be liable to pay at the end of the proceedings, when final orders were made, including for costs. EMAS now seeks that it be repaid the $100,000 that it had paid to the Marshal in answer to his calls for security. APC opposed that relief. It argued that the $100,000 paid by EMAS to the Marshal should be used to discharge the costs and expenses of the arrest and release and that the balance of $8,326.37 be refunded to EMAS. In contrast, APC sought that some of the $92,100 it had paid into the Marshal's fund to secure the release of the barge be held as security for any liability it may ultimately be found to have to EMAS. APC argued that the $25,000 should be treated as an overpayment of what was due to the Marshal. APC argued that the $92,100 that it had paid on 30 July 2009 should be used to pay $66,674 into the same account as the $1,439,601.05 so that it would be security, with the $25,000, for any entitlement EMAS may later establish against APC for the Marshal's costs of the arrest and release. APC said that the balance of the $92,100, namely $25,426, should be repaid to it, treating this sum as an overpayment of security it had made to obtain the release. Neither party contended that the Marshal was entitled to retain more than the amount necessary to pay the actual costs and expenses he had incurred (or, before they were crystallised, an amount on account of those costs and expenses). I have not been referred to any case that has considered how to apply a double payment in full to the Marshal of his demands for actual costs and expenses by each of the parties in compliance with their undertakings under rr 41 and 53. Under s 34(1)(a)(ii) of the Admiralty Act 1988 (Cth) if, a party unreasonably and without good cause obtains the arrest of a ship under the Act, that party or person will be liable in damages to any party to the proceeding or to a person who has an interest in a ship who suffered loss or damage as a direct result. Thus, if it were established that the arrest was unjustified (i.e. obtained unreasonably and without good cause) a person in APC's position would be entitled to claim damages from the person in EMAS' position who caused the arrest to be made. EMAS argued that s 34(1)(a)(ii) provided the only basis on which it could be required to pay for the costs and expenses payable by APC to obtain the release pursuant to it undertaking under r 53. And EMAS contended that in any event APC had paid the $92,100 unconditionally, in accordance with the form 19 it lodged by APC to obtain there lease. Importantly, when an application for an arrest warrant is made, r 41 provides that the application itself constitutes an undertaking to the Court to pay to the Marshal on demand an amount equal to the amount of the costs and expenses of the Marshal in relation to the arrest, including costs and expenses in relation to the ship while it is under arrest. The rule provides that this undertaking is given by the person who actually makes the application for the arrest warrant. Thus, if the application is made personally by a plaintiff, it will be personally liable on the undertaking under r 41, if it is made by a plaintiff's Australian legal practitioner, the practitioner will be personally liable. When an application is made to release a ship from arrest, relevantly under r 52 and 53, that application too constitutes an undertaking to the Court made by whomever personally makes it, to pay to the Marshal on demand the amount of the Marshal's costs and expenses in connection with the custody of the ship while it was under arrest, including the costs and expenses associated with the release from arrest of the ship or property. Next, neither party sought to apply at the present time under r 75C which provides: \" 75C Orders relating to undertakings and securities (1) This rule applies if the court accepts more than one undertaking or security in relation to the Marshal's costs and expenses. (2) The court may make directions and orders in relation to: (a) the just and fair allocation of responsibilities between those undertakings or securities; and (b) if appropriate, the release of a person from an undertaking, with or without conditions. \" CONSIDERATION The purpose for the undertaking under r 41 is to ensure that the Marshal will be able to meet the costs and expenses first, of the actual arrest and, secondly, of preserving and maintaining the ship or other property while it is under arrest. The purpose of the arrest, of course, is to obtain security for the plaintiff's claim and to encourage a relevant person to file an appearance in personam . The purpose of the undertaking in r 53 given to obtain the release from arrest of the ship under rr 51 and 52 is different. It is to meet the costs and expenses actually incurred by the Marshal \"... in connection with the custody of the ship or property while it was under arrest, including costs and expenses associated with its release from arrest\". Notably, the forms of undertaking in rr 41 and 53 have different scopes. The former covers the costs and expenses of the actual arrest, while the latter does not extend that far. And, the undertaking under r 53 covers the costs and expenses of the release, while that under r 41 does not. It is an important feature of r 53 that the Marshal is not authorised to demand the initial costs and expenses of the arrest. That, however, does not prevent the plaintiff seeking proper provision for these as a condition of the release of the ship. Once the ship has been released, the Marshal will no longer be able to resort to it as security for his costs and expenses. Thus, a person seeking the release must pay, or undertake to the satisfaction of the Marshal under r 53(2) to pay, to the Marshal the costs and expenses as provided in r 53(1) and form 19. Often, the person seeking release will be a relevant person who has provided security for the plaintiff's claim. The relevant person should also bear primary responsibility for the costs and expenses of the Marshal because it regains the ship from arrest. If no relevant person had appeared, then in the ordinary course, the ship would be sold and all the Marshal's costs and expenses in relation to its arrest and custody would be paid out of the proceeds as a priority claim. In Patrick Stevedores No 2 Pty Limited v Ship MV \"Turakina\" (No 2) (1998) 84 FCR 506 at 509E-F, Tamberlin J said that it was neither necessary nor appropriate to approach the undertakings, as then provided for in the Rules, on the basis that they were mutually exclusive. He also said that the undertakings did not have to be read down so as not to cover costs or expenses that may be encompassed by other undertakings that might be given by other persons. He observed that the Marshal could not claim double reimbursement in respect of the same costs or expenses. His Honour suggested that the parties should negotiate and resolve, as between themselves, the working out of the entitlements and obligations of each party who had provided an undertaking. However, this was prior to the introduction of r 75C. The undertaking that form 19 requires extends to the whole of the period of the arrest and the release, because the applicant for release must apply under r 52(1) in accordance with form 19 for the release of the ship. Once the person seeking the release of the ship from arrest provides a payment to the Marshal, or a sufficient level of confidence in the undertaking given, the ship will be released. Ordinarily, the person seeking the release of the ship will be the relevant person or someone acting for the relevant person. If the arrest has been short, the costs and expenses are not likely to be large. But, if the arrest has been for a long period of time (until the relevant person has been impelled to appear or to provide the security necessary to recover the ship from arrest) prima facie, there could be a hardship on a plaintiff if APC's construction of the operation of the Rules were correct. As Tamberlin J pointed out the Marshal cannot obtain double reimbursement. In the present case, the Marshal obtained security from EMAS, in the form of cash paid pursuant to his demands. But, the Marshal did not pay any costs and expenses prior to receiving the form 19 and payment from APC. Giving effect to APC's argument would produce the consequence that EMAS would now have to pay all of the Marshal's costs and expenses while APC would simply provide security for those payments to be available in the event that it were held liable for them at the conclusion of the proceedings. Such a construction does not lie easily with the requirements of r 52(1), r 53 and form 19. Nor, does it sit easily with the ordinary and natural meaning of s 34(1)(a)(ii) that limits the right of, among others, a relevant person in APC's position to recover damages from a plaintiff in EMAS' position for wrongful arrest. If the person seeking the release of the ship were not, prima facie, liable to pay all of the costs of and in connection with her custody and release, there could be a serious inhibition on the exercise by plaintiffs of their rights to arrest. And, this construction would extend the limited form of liability of a person who caused an arrest created by the Parliament in s 34 in cases where the power to arrest had been misused. I reject APC's argument that a defendant who seeks the release of its ship, would simply be required to provide security for the costs and expenses which the plaintiff had already paid to the Marshal in connection with its arrest. A literal meaning of the Rules does not support that construction : Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 7 ; (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 338 [34] - [35] . CONCLUSION I am of opinion that at the present time the costs and expenses of the actual arrest should be paid out of the amount that EMAS has paid to the Marshal and the balance of its payment of $100,000 returned to it. And, all other costs and expenses of the Marshal, including in connection with keeping the barge in custody and its release, should be paid out of the $92,100 paid by APC to secure the release. So much of the balance of those funds, equal to what was paid out of EMAS' $100,000, should be added to the amount paid into court by APC as security to abide the ultimate disposition of the proceedings. EMAS may later be able to establish its entitlement to this sum under r 75C or in the substantive proceedings. This allocation of responsibility reflects the prima facie distribution of the burden of the undertakings in rr 41 and 53 which EMAS and APC respectively assumed when each of them became bound to honour them. And it ensures that the security available to EMAS will not be diminished by the costs of the arrest in the event that it is successful in the end result. The parties asked that I make no order in relation to the costs of the present application, until after they had had an opportunity to consider these reasons and make submissions on the basis of stances each taken in the negotiations prior to the hearing. I will direct that the parties bring in short minutes to give effect to these reasons. I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

The matter involved an appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court and raised an issue about the power of the Minister to remove the applicant from Australia having regard to the terms of s 198(6)(c)(i) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). Section 198(6)(c)(i) imposes an obligation upon the relevant officers to remove an unlawful citizen as soon as reasonably practicable in circumstances where, relevantly, the grant of a visa has been refused and the application has been \"finally determined\". The circumstances in which the matter came before the Full Court are identified in [2]-[7] of the Full Court's reasons for judgment. In short, the applicant attended a hearing of the Refugee Review Tribunal ( the Tribunal ) in response to an invitation to do so; through some form of administrative error, the applicant was not called into the hearing room to give evidence in support of his application for review of a decision of the Minister's delegate to refuse the applicant a protection visa. Consequently, the Tribunal, pursuant to s 426A(1) of the Migration Act , dismissed the applicant's application for review on the basis of the Tribunal's understanding that the applicant had failed to attend the hearing without any explanation. After a lengthy delay, the applicant applied to the Federal Magistrates Court seeking orders quashing the Tribunal's decision. In SZKUO v Minister for Immigration & Anor [2007] FMCA 2073 the Federal Magistrate accepted the facts relating to the applicant's attendance at the Tribunal. The Federal Magistrate determined that although these factual circumstances amounted to a jurisdictional error by the Tribunal there was a discretion to withhold relief. The six year delay between the Tribunal hearing and the application to the Federal Magistrates Court was not adequately explained. Accordingly, the Federal Magistrate made orders dismissing the application. The applicant attempted to obtain an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal against the Federal Magistrate's decision but this was refused ( SZKUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 93). Thereafter, the applicant commenced further proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court seeking a declaration that he was not liable to detention or removal from Australia because his visa application had not been \"finally determined\" within the meaning of s 198(6)(c)(i) of the Migration Act . The Federal Magistrates Court dismissed that proceeding ( SZKUO v Minister for Immigration (No 2) [2009] FMCA 498). An appeal thereafter followed to the Full Court of the Federal Court. The decision of the Full Court that the appeal be dismissed was unanimous ( SZKUO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCAFC 167). The reasoning underlying that decision is set out in [22]-[34] of the Full Court's judgment. In the present application there was no dispute between the parties that I had the power to make the orders sought by the applicant, although there was an issue raised about whether the substance of the orders sought would be a stay of the orders of the Full Court or an order restraining the Minister from exercising his powers of removal under the Migration Act . The Minister, nevertheless, accepted that an order in the nature of an injunction could be made. That acceptance is consistent with the observations of Branson J in Papachristopoulos v Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (unreported, NG 719 of 1997, 17 December 1997) in which Branson J referred to her own decision in Re Cortaus Ltd (in liq); Sheahan v Joye (1996) 19 ACSR 591 to the effect that a single judge has the power to grant an application of the kind sought in this case, that power being derived from s 20 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Although the parties were on common ground in relation to the issue of power, they diverged about the correct test to apply. In Jennings Construction Limited v Burgundy Royale Investments Pty Limited (No 1) [1986] HCA 84 ; (1986) 161 CLR 681 at 684 Brennan J identified that a \"stay to preserve the subject matter of litigation pending an application for special leave to appeal is an extraordinary jurisdiction\". His Honour said that \"exceptional circumstances\" must be shown before exercise of this power is warranted. Mason CJ in Smith Kline & French Laboratories (Australia) Limited v Secretary, Department of Community Services and Health [1991] HCA 13 ; (1991) 99 ALR 417 at 419 also stated that the jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief to preserve the subject matter of litigation pending the determination of an application for special leave to appeal or of an appeal pursuant to such a grant of leave is an \"extraordinary one\" and would be granted only in \"exceptional circumstances\". Kirby J in Bryant v Commonwealth Bank of Australia [1996] HCA 3 ; (1996) 134 ALR 460 at 463 referred to a distinction between the general approach in the High Court (where special or exceptional circumstances must be shown in order to secure provision of a stay pending an appeal) and the approach in other courts, specifically the New South Wales Court of Appeal, which have adopted a less stringent approach. At 463-464, Kirby J explained the reasons underlying this distinction as follows: In the High Court the old rule of stringency continues largely to be maintained with particular force where no grant of special leave to appeal has yet been secured. There are obvious reasons for a measure of greater stringency at this point. Ordinarily, the case will have proceeded through at least two tiers of the judicial process. The would-be appellant's arguments will have been rejected by the court whose orders are the subject of the special leave application. Only a relatively small proportion of the applications for special leave succeed. To succeed, something more than legal or factual error must be shown. There are reasons for maintaining a higher standard in this court for the provision of a stay then would now usually be imposed by other Australian appellate courts in respect of invocations of their jurisdiction. The Minister, based on these authorities, advocated the application of the stringent test identified by Brennan J in Jennings Construction . The applicant referred to decisions of the New South Wales Court of Appeal in which that Court applied the less stringent test to which Kirby J made reference in Bryant . In Minister for Local Government v South Sydney City Council (No 3) [2002] NSWCA 327 at [10] to [12] Spigelman CJ identified that the principles applicable to a stay and an injunction substantially overlap. His Honour read the decisions in Jennings Construction and Smith Kline as being authority for the proposition that an intermediate court of appeal should not be diffident in granting a stay or an injunction in an appropriate case notwithstanding the difficulty that may be occasioned for a member of such a court in making an assessment of the prospect of a grant of special leave in a particular case. McColl J in Miller v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2008] NSWCA 261 also identified the divergence between the approach of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and that of the High Court. The approach of the New South Wales Court of Appeal, her Honour observed, derives from the decision of Sibuse Pty Limited v Shaw (No 2) (1988) 13 NSWLR 125 in which the Court adopted the test that a stay or injunction would be granted pending an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court only in an \"appropriate\" case. McColl J adopted the Sibuse line of authority on the basis that it was a decision of three judges of the New South Wales Court of Appeal which had been followed in other cases of that Court and which had not yet been the subject of criticism by the High Court. In so doing her Honour made express reference to the decision of Kirby J in Bryant . The applicant ultimately submitted that, irrespective of the test to be applied, the circumstances of this case met the requisite standard. It seems to me that there is a divergence of approach between the High Court and the New South Wales Court of Appeal, the latter being an intermediate appellate court. Given the status of this Court as an intermediate appellate court, the considerations and approach adopted by Branson J in Papachristopoulos , as well as the other decisions of single judges of this Court to which I have been taken in oral submissions, it seems to me that I should apply the less stringent test; however, I also propose to deal with the matter by reference to both standards given that I have reached a conclusion of a sufficient degree of confidence to be able to do so. In relation to the relevant factors both parties relied on the decision in Jennings Construction where Brennan J at 685 said that: In each case when the Court is satisfied a stay is required to preserve the subject matter of the litigation it is relevant to consider: first, whether there is a substantial prospect that special leave to appeal will be granted; secondly, whether the applicant has failed to take whatever steps are necessary to seek a stay from the court in which the matter is pending; thirdly, whether the grant of a stay will cause loss to the respondent; and, fourthly, where the balance of convenience lies. The Minister's submissions accepted (as was appropriate) that the factors relevant to the balance of convenience mostly weighed in favour of the applicant. However, the Minister said that this was insufficient to warrant an injunction. The Minister emphasised that the Full Court had unanimously dismissed the appeal from the Federal Magistrates Court. Although the applicant sought to identify issues of legal principle about the legal effect of discretionary decisions having regard to the reasoning in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Bhardwaj (2002) 209 CLR 597 ; [2002] HCA 11 , the present case involved nothing more than a matter of statutory construction. Hence, the Minister submitted that Bhardwaj and the issues to which it gives rise should be seen as an interesting side-line in this matter. For these reasons the Minister submitted that there was no substantial chance that the applicant would be granted special leave. The Minister also referred to the fact that the applicant has been in detention, at the cost of the Australian public, since 9 April 2008. In consequence the Minister submitted that the Minister should be entitled to the fruits of his success and be able to implement the removal of the applicant on the date as scheduled, being this Friday, 18 December 2009. It is true and I accept that the applicant has been in detention for a considerable period of time. If I make orders as the applicant seeks, the applicant will continue to be so detained at the expense of the Australian public. As Branson J identified in Papachristopoulos that is a relevant factor. Branson J also identified, however, that very considerable weight should be given to the right of all persons in Australia to approach the Australian courts and to have their legal rights and obligations determined according to law. Ultimately in Papachristopoulos her Honour considered that the Full Court in dismissing the appeal had not identified any point of legal principle with the consequence that the prospect of the grant of special leave to the High Court was \"so remote\" that no extension of the injunction earlier made in that proceeding should be granted. In Bryant Kirby J said that a decision on a stay application should not become an occasion for a detailed analysis of the issues that will arise in the special leave application and (if granted special leave) the appeal. His Honour noted (at 463) that the evaluation of the prospects of success will necessarily involve a matter of judicial impression. That judicial impression, his Honour noted, does not predetermine one way or the other the substantive application. As both parties are aware I was a member of the Full Court which unanimously dismissed the applicant's appeal. That latter fact, however, does not remove the overall judicial impression that one can obtain from reading the reasons for decision. Specifically, insofar as I am aware, the applicant is correct in identifying that the High Court has not yet had an opportunity to consider the legal effect of a discretionary decision on the Minister's power of removal. Further, the applicant is also correct in identifying that there is scope for debate arising from the High Court's decision in Bhardwaj as to the existence and relevance of a party's underlying rights and the source of those underlying rights in terms of the relief granted on a judicial review application. This emerges from paragraphs to which I have been taken by the applicant particularly at [46], [57] and [58] of the reasons for judgment in Bhardwaj . The applicant also submitted that the definition of \"finally determined\" (s 5(9) of the Migration Act ), which refers to a decision which is no longer \"subject to any form of review\", describes a legal rather than a factual condition. The relevant authorities appear to indicate that the concept of a substantial prospect of a grant of special leave includes a prospect which may be described as not insubstantial or not remote. This matter gives rise to issues which satisfy me that the applicant has a not insubstantial or not remote prospect of obtaining a grant of special leave. In addition to my satisfaction about this issue, it is also apparent (and indeed not disputed by the Minister) that an order is required to preserve the subject matter of the litigation. The subject matter of the litigation is the capacity or power of the Minister to deport the applicant from Australia. If the applicant is deported from Australia on 18 December as proposed the subject matter of the litigation will be entirely removed. The balance of convenience also heavily favours the applicant. The notice of removal which was served on the applicant on or about 11 December 2009 appears to identify three restrictions that would apply to the applicant if removed. First, the applicant may not be eligible for the grant of another Australian visa pending repayment of debts owed to the Commonwealth of Australia. Second, the applicant may not be eligible for the grant of another Australian visa for a period of three years because the basis of his deportation is as an unlawful non-citizen more than 28 days after the applicant's last substantive visa ceased. Third, the applicant may not be eligible for the grant of another Australian visa for 12 months on the basis of the statutory powers relied upon by the Minister to remove the applicant. In these circumstances, all of the relevant discretionary factors weigh heavily in favour of the applicant. The only factor which weighs against the applicant is the cost of maintaining the applicant in detention for the relevant period. This factor, even taken together with the fact that the applicant has been unsuccessful before the Federal Magistrates Court and unanimously before this Court, cannot outweigh the other factors to which I have referred. In summary, my overall impression is that there are matters of general importance to the operation of the Migration Act and the Minister's powers (as well as the individual position of the present applicant) which arise in this case. I cannot conclude that there is not a substantial prospect of special leave being granted. It follows that I am comfortably satisfied that this is an appropriate case for the making of an order in the nature of an injunction. I am also able to say, if I need to, that having regard to the factors as identified by Brennan J in Jennings Construction , the matter meets the standard of an exceptional case. It raises new issues about the Minister's powers which have not been previously determined. It raises what seems to me to be an important point about the operation of the provisions of the Migration Act . Accordingly, I am minded to make the orders sought by the applicant. I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jagot.

In turn, this depends upon whether the Victorian Arts Centre Trust, a statutory corporation established by the Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 (Vic) ('the VAC Act'), is properly described as a State Government department or instrumentality, for the purposes of the award provisions. 2 The applicant seeks penalties, pursuant to s 178 of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act') for breaches of the terms of two awards. The first award is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 1994 ('the 1994 Award'). The second is the Building Services (Victoria) Award 2003 ('the 2003 Award'). In each case, the respondent is alleged to have failed to pay named employees amounts it was required to pay by a specified clause of the award. The applicant seeks an order, pursuant to s 178(6) of the WR Act, that the respondent pay to each of those employees the amount owing to him or her. The applicant also seeks that those payments include interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act. Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, the applicant also seeks an order that each penalty be paid to it. The admitted or agreed facts 3 The following is a summary of the facts admitted on the pleadings or agreed between the parties prior to the trial. 4 The applicant is an organisation of employees, registered pursuant to the WR Act. The respondent is a company and is capable of being sued as such. The 1994 Award is an award made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission ('the Commission'), pursuant to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (Cth), which subsequently became the WR Act. Each of the applicant and the respondent is a party to, and bound by, the 1994 Award. Similarly, the 2003 Award is an award made by the Commission, pursuant to the WR Act. Each of the applicant and the respondent is a party to, and bound by, the 2003 Award. (The fact that the applicant is a party to each of the awards gives it standing to sue for a penalty for a breach of a term of each of the awards, pursuant to s 178(5)(b) of the WR Act. ) 5 Between 1 February 1998 and 23 January 2003, the respondent employed a number of persons in the contract cleaning industry, to perform work at the Victorian Arts Centre at 100 St Kilda Road, Melbourne. Specifically, it employed the following persons in the following classifications, prescribed by cl 8 of the 1994 Award: (a) employed in the classification of Building Attendant Grade 1 were Maria Andronikis, Stavroula Athinis, Emanuel Azzopardi, Peter Blanas, Menka Crneska, Fay Dervenis, Koray Mehmet Dincer, Randolph Patrick Guiman, Trajanka Jancev, Athanasios Kasapis, Eugenia Kasapi, John Markopoulos, Vasilios Paganis, Nick Papoutsoglou, John Peroustianis, Vijoleta Rzanovska, Souze Stylianos, Maria Tapia, Suzana Tasevski, Athina Tsalparos, Despina Tsirakidis, Cvetanka Vermeska and Gorica Zatkoska; (b) employed within the classification of Building Attendant Grade 2 were Peter Koukouvaos, Kanelos Pyliotis and Peter Skevis; and (c) Helen Kostakis was employed in the classification of Building Attendant Grade 3. 6 Throughout the period from 1 February 1998 to 23 January 2003, cl 8A of the 1994 Award provided relevantly as follows: 'That in addition to the rates of pay prescribed in clause 8 --- Classifications and wage rates, the following payments shall be made for all purposes of the award. Adult employees (a)(i)... (ii) S.G.D.I. : In premises of State Government Departments and Instrumentalities. Full-time; per week Building Attendant Grade One $24.70 Building Attendant Grade Two $25.90 Building Attendant Grade Three $28.40 Part-time; per hour Building Attendant Grade One Mon --- Fri $0.75 Saturday $1.07 Sunday $1.40 Public Holidays $1.72 Building Attendant Grade Two Mon --- Fri $0.78 Saturday $1.12 Sunday $1.46 Public holiday $1.80 Building Attendant Grade Three Mon --- Fri $0.86 Saturday $1.23 Sunday $1.61 Public holidays $1.98' 7 The second period in respect of which the applicant claims is the period between 23 January 2003 and 1 June 2003. During that period, the respondent employed a number of persons in the contract cleaning industry, to perform work at the Victorian Arts Centre. Specifically, the following employees were employed within the following classifications listed in cl 15 of the 2003 Award: (a) employed within the classification of Building Attendant Grade 1 were Maria Andronikis, Stavroula Athinis, Emanuel Azzopardi, Peter Blanas, Menka Crneska, Fay Dervenis, Koray Mehmet Dincer, Randolph Patrick Guiman, Trajanka Jancev, Athanasios Kasapis, Eugenia Kasapi, John Markopoulos, Vasilios Paganis, Nick Papoutsoglou, John Peroustianis, Vijoleta Rzanovska, Souze Stylianos, Maria Tapia, Suzana Tasevski, Athina Tsalparos, Despina Tsirakidis, Cvetanka Vermeska and Gorica Zatkoska. (b) employed within the classification of Building Attendant Grade 2 were Peter Koukouvaos, Kanelos Pyliotis and Peter Skevis. (c) Helen Kostakis was employed within the classification of Building Attendant Grade 3. 8 Throughout the period between 23 January 2003 and 1 June 2003, cl 15.3 of the 2003 Award provided relevantly as follows: 'That in addition to the rates of pay prescribed in clause 15 --- Classifications and wage rates, the following payments shall be made for all purposes of the award. 15.3.1 Adult employees 15.3.1(a)... 15.3.1(b) S.G.D.I --- in premises of State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Full-time --- per week $ Building Attendant Grade 1 24.70 Building Attendant Grade 2 25.90 Building Attendant Grade 3 28.40 Part-time --- per hour $ Building Attendant Grade 1 Mon-Fri 0.75 Saturday 1.07 Sunday 1.40 Public holidays 1.72 Building Attendant Grade 2 Mon-Fri 0.78 Saturday 1.12 Sunday 1.46 Public holidays 1.80 Building Attendant Grade 3 Mon-Fri 0.86 Saturday 1.23 Sunday 1.61 Public holidays 1.98' 9 The respondent concedes that it has not made the payments required by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to any of its employees performing work at the Victorian Arts Centre. The respondent contends that it is not bound to make such payments. If it is required to make such payments, the parties are agreed that the respondent has underpaid the following persons by the following amounts in respect of the two periods concerned: Name Amount Maria Andronikis $ 4,688.04 Stavroula Athinis $ 7,570.93 Emanuel Azzopardi $ 7,987.31 Peter Blanas $ 5,930.38 Menka Crneska $ 3,137.42 Fay Dervenis $ 3,170.22 Koray Mehmet Dincer $ 707.93 Randolph Patrick Guiman $ 6,752.25 Trajanka Jancev $ 9,316.66 Athanasios Kasapis $ 1,383.58 Eugenia Kasapi $ 4,094.56 Helen Kostakis $13,195.85 Peter Koukouvaos $ 7,066.19 John Markopoulos $ 4,510.81 Vasilios Paganis $ 6,728.50 Nick Papoutsoglou $ 7,156.83 John Peroustianis $ 1,951.67 Kanelos Pyliotis $ 8,712.20 Vijoleta Rzanovska $10,903.80 Peter Skevis $ 7,925.81 Souze Stylianos $ 3,817.75 Maria Tapia $ 2,424.32 Suzana Tasevski $ 1,658.34 Athina Tsalparos $ 5,661.93 Despina Tsirakidis $ 5,531.25 Cvetanka Vermeska $ 2,021.19 Gorica Zatkoska $ 1,737.28 The Victorian Arts Centre Trust 10 The legislative history of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust ('the Trust') goes back at least to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Act 1956 (Vic) ('the 1956 Act'). The preamble to the 1956 Act recited that a power to reserve certain land as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre had been given to the Governor-in-Council under the Melbourne South Land Act 1946 (Vic), and that it was expedient to make provision for the vesting of such land in a committee constituted for the purpose of raising funds and providing a suitable building on such site. Section 3(1) of the 1956 Act provided: 'For the purposes of raising funds for the erection of a suitable building on the land reserved under the Principal Act and for the erection of such a building on such land there shall be a committee which committee shall be a body corporate under the name of the \" National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee \" with perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and being sued. ' 11 Section 5 provided for the grant to the National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre Building Committee ('the Building Committee') of land reserved as a site for a National Art Gallery and Cultural Centre. Section 8 made provision for part of the land concerned to be used as a road, without such use operating to dedicate it as a public highway, and for part of the land to be used for ornamental purposes, for which the City of Melbourne was to have responsibility. Section 9(1) provided that the Building Committee would be entitled to the rents and profits of any land granted to it by the Crown. 12 The 1956 Act was amended by Act No. 6522 of 1959. The amendments included the insertion among the powers of the Building Committee of the power to borrow on terms and conditions approved by the Treasurer of Victoria and the addition of a power, granted to the Treasurer of Victoria, to guarantee the repayment of any sum borrowed by the Building Committee with the Treasurer's approval and any interest on such sum. 13 By s 12(1)(b) of Act No. 8249 of 1972, the Building Committee was renamed the Victorian Arts Centre Building Committee. 14 The Trust was established by the VAC Act, which came into operation on 13 March 1980. Section 4 provided: '(1) There shall be established a body corporate by the name of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust which shall have perpetual succession and a common seal and shall be capable in law of suing and of being sued and of taking purchasing holding demising selling transferring conveying mortgaging or otherwise disposing of real and personal property for the purposes of and subject to this Act and of being and suffering all acts matters and things which bodies corporate may by law do and suffer. (2) Subject to the general direction and control of the Minister the Trust shall be responsible for the management of the Centre. ' 15 The word 'Centre' is defined in s 3 of the VAC Act as including the relevant land, and the buildings and improvements erected on it. By s 2(a) and (b) of the VAC Act, the Building Committee went out of office on the day on which the VAC Act came into operation, and the Trust became its successor in law. By s 2(d) of the VAC Act, all property vested in the Building Committee became vested in the Trust on that date. 16 The functions of the Trust are set out in s 5 of the VAC Act: '(1) The functions of the Trust are− (a) to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Centre; and (b) to present and produce theatrical performances, operas, plays, dramas, ballets and musical and other performances and entertainment of any kind at any place; and (c) to promote the use of the theatres, concert hall and other places of assembly by suitable persons and bodies; and (d) to provide leadership in the promotion and development of the performing arts; and (e) to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development and promotion of the State collection of performing arts material; and (f) to oversee the exhibition of performing arts material from the State collection and make any performing arts material from the State collection available on loan to persons or institutions; and (fa) to establish, maintain, conserve, develop, promote and exhibit the public art collection; and (fb) to make any object from the public art collection available for study or loan to persons or institutions, subject to any conditions that the Trust determines; and (g) to carry on, whether within or outside Victoria, whether alone or in association with any other person or persons and whether or not in relation to the Centre, a business of providing ticketing, inventory management of admissions, marketing and related services; and (h) to perform any other functions appropriate to the Centre as the Minister may approve; and (i) to carry out any other function conferred on the Trust under this Act. (2) In carrying out its functions, the Trust must endeavour to contribute to the enrichment of the cultural, educational, social and economic life of the people of Victoria. ' 17 The powers of the Trust, conferred by s 6 of the VAC Act, are the sorts of powers ordinarily conferred on a statutory corporation, with the addition of some that might be considered unusual for a government body. For example, s 6(2) confers on the Trust the following powers: '(e) to apply for and hold any licence or permit under the Liquor Control Reform Act 1998 or any other Act; (f) to register, purchase or apply for or otherwise acquire either wholly or in part any invention, copyright, trade-mark or other mark or design, patent, patent rights and privileges, licences, concessions or other like rights which in the opinion of the Trust will be of assistance to the Trust in carrying out its functions and to sell, dispose of, use, exercise and develop such rights or inventions or to grant licences or privileges in respect thereof; ... (h) to install, use, work and maintain film cameras and projectors and broadcasting and television apparatus, and to grant the right of installing, using, working and maintaining the same within the areas under its control upon such terms and conditions and subject to the payment of such charges as may be determined by the Trust; (i) to print or reproduce in any manner or form and to publish or to arrange for the printing or reproduction or publishing of plays, music, programmes, posters and advertisements and such other material as the Trust may deem expedient and to acquire the copyright therein; (j) to commission plays, compositions, musicals, ballets, operas or other works;' 18 The Trust's borrowing powers, conferred by s 7 of the VAC Act, are confined to borrowing with the approval of the Treasurer and subject to such terms, conditions and limits as the Treasurer imposes. The Treasurer has power, given by s 7(3), to guarantee repayment and the payment of interest, charges and expenses. 19 By amendment to the VAC Act in 2000, s 14(4) provides that a person employed by the Trust is not, in respect of that employment, subject to the provisions of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic). Also by later amendment, ss 3A and 3B of the VAC Act provide that the Trust has vested in it collections of performing arts material and artworks. By s 18 of the VAC Act, the Trust may not sell or dispose of any item that is part of those collections without advertising its intention. If any objection is received, the decision whether to sell is one for the Minister, or a delegate of the Minister. By amendment of the VAC Act in 1994, s 18A was inserted, to give the Trust power to make by-laws. 20 It may be relevant to observe how the Trust sees itself. In its annual report for 2003-2004, the Trust described itself as follows: 'Purpose and statutory functions The core purpose of the Victorian Arts Centre Trust (the Trust) is to enrich the lives of Victorians --- culturally, educationally, socially and economically ( Victorian Arts Centre Act 1979 Section 5 ). The Trust's responsibilities include: • to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Arts Centre; • to produce and present theatrical performances of any kind; • to promote the use of the Arts Centre by the community; • to ensure the maintenance, conservation, development, promotion and exhibition of the State collection of performing arts materials and the public art collection, as well as making material available for study or loan. Our role • providing leadership in the creation, presentation, promotion and advocacy of the performing arts; • stimulating curiosity and understanding of the performing arts; • increasing accessibility and enjoyment of the performing arts; • creating partnerships that increase the value and potential of the performing arts; • exercising responsible care and presentation of publicly owned cultural assets. Our vision Our vision is of a society that values the performing arts. ' 21 In two places on its web site, the Trust describes itself as: 'a statutory authority of the Arts Portfolio. The Arts Portfolio is administered by Arts Victoria, a division of the Department of Premier and Cabinet. ' 22 Further, on its web page, the Trust says: 'The Arts Centre is the flagship of the performing arts in Victoria, and the focal point of Melbourne's cultural precinct. The Arts Centre is owned by the people of Victoria, and we welcome people at large to experience all that the Arts Centre has to offer. In assocciation [ sic ] with some of Australia's top performing arts companies, and an array of national and international companies, we present a unique diversity of arts and entertainment choices all year round. The Arts Centre also offers eating and exhibitions to appeal to every age, taste and budget. ' 23 The Arts Victoria Act 1972 (Vic) creates the office of Director, Arts Victoria, and provides for the appointment of a body called the Victorian Council of the Arts. Section 4 of that Act provides, in relation to the Department of Premier and Cabinet: 'The objects of the Department under this Act are− (a) to develop and improve the knowledge understanding appreciation and practice of the Arts in Victoria; (b) to increase the availability and accessibility of the Arts to the public of Victoria; (c) to encourage and assist in the provision of facilities to enable the Arts to be performed or displayed; (d) to continually survey and assess the position of the Arts in Victoria and to report to the Parliament at least once in every year on the condition of the Arts in Victoria and to suggest ways in which the Arts may be further and better assisted; (e) to administer the Acts and enactments for which the Minister is responsible; (f) to advise and co-operate with other Departments of the Government public statutory authorities municipalities and other persons or bodies concerned with the promotion or practice of the Arts in Victoria. ' 24 It is clear that the Trust is not a State Government department, for the purposes of the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in the award clauses with which this case is concerned. There is a clear contrast between the Trust and Arts Victoria, which is described as a division of what is undoubtedly a State Government department. The test for determining whether a particular body is an 'instrumentality' of a State, within the ordinary meaning of that term, is found in Re Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; Ex parte State Public Services Federation [1992] HCA 53 ; (1992) 175 CLR 442 at 448, where the High Court said: 'It is well settled that union eligibility rules are to be interpreted liberally and according to their ordinary and popular meaning. However, the expression \"State instrumentality\" is one that carries much the same meaning in popular usage as in a legal context. That meaning directs attention to the purpose or end served, so that a body is a State instrumentality if it is empowered to and does, in fact, serve some State government purpose. And that is so even if it is neither a servant nor an agent of the State. ' [Footnotes omitted] 25 Among the authorities cited for the central proposition is the passage in the judgment of Isaacs and Rich JJ in Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees' Union of Australia v Melbourne Corporation [1919] HCA 72 ; (1919) 26 CLR 508 at 530---531, where their Honours said: 'If a municipality either (1) is legally empowered to perform and does perform any function whatever for the Crown, or (2) is lawfully empowered to perform and does perform any function which constitutionally is inalienably a Crown function − as, for instance, the administration of justice − the municipality is in law presumed to represent the Crown, and the exemption applies. Otherwise, it is outside that exemption, and, if impliedly exempted at all, some other principle must be resorted to. The making and maintenance of streets in the municipality is not within either proposition. ' 26 In the Anti-Cancer Council case, the court held that the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria ('the ACCV') was not a 'State instrumentality', within the meaning of that expression in a trade union's eligibility rules. The ACCV was not under ministerial control. Its only function that might have been described as serving a State Government purpose was the receipt of reports and the keeping and compiling of a register, for which the ACCV received a small amount of government funding. Significantly, there was no obligation imposed on the ACCV with respect to the reports it received or the cancer register. The court held that the ACCV fell within another limb of the rule of the trade union in question, which defined those eligible for membership. 27 Counsel for the respondent relied on R v Industrial Court of South Australia; Ex parte Australian Broadcasting Commission (1976) 13 SASR 460. The Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the Australian Broadcasting Commission ('the ABC') was not an 'instrumentality or agency of the Government of the Commonwealth', within the meaning of s 114 of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1972---1975 (SA). At 284, Bray CJ, with whom Hogarth J agreed, referred to Electricity Trust of South Australia v Linterns Ltd [1950] SASR 133, in which it was held that the Electricity Trust of South Australia was a government instrumentality, as it managed the undertaking for the supply of electricity and the mining of coal in South Australia, exercised its functions on behalf of the Crown, and was the means or agency for managing a Crown asset. At 284---285, Bray CJ conceded that the ABC might be regarded as an instrumentality of the Commonwealth, but expressed the view that it could not be regarded as an instrumentality of the 'Government' of the Commonwealth. His Honour took the view that the word 'Government', with a capital initial, in s 114 meant the executive government of the Commonwealth. At 285, his Honour examined various provisions of the statute creating the ABC, emphasising the degree of autonomy from the executive government enjoyed by the ABC (with ministerial control only over a small number of specified functions, or in some exceptional specified circumstances), and the obligation of the ABC to indemnify the Postmaster-General in respect of any claim for anything done by the Postmaster-General's Department at the request of the ABC. His Honour also pointed out that there was nothing in the statute declaring that the ABC held its assets on behalf of the Crown. At 285---286, Bray CJ also regarded as relevant the question whether the degree of ministerial control was sufficient to entitle the ABC to the shield of the Crown. Assuming it to have been decided correctly, the ABC case is readily distinguishable from the present. 28 In the present case, one of the most striking features of the Trust is the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control. By s 4(2) of the VAC Act, the Trust's management of the Victorian Arts Centre is expressly subject to the general direction and control of the relevant Minister of the Crown. The Trust can only perform functions outside those expressly conferred by s 5(1) if the Minister approves of such functions (see s5(1)(h)). The exercise of the Trust's borrowing power is only possible with the approval of the Treasurer, under s 7. The extent of ministerial control is such that the Trust would be very likely to have the benefit of the immunity of the Crown from the application of legislation not expressed to bind the Crown, or from being sued or convicted of a criminal offence. In determining whether a statutory authority has such immunity, the extent to which it is subject to ministerial control under its establishing legislation is of great importance. See Superannuation Fund Investment Trust v Commissioner of Stamps (SA) [1979] HCA 34 ; (1979) 145 CLR 330 at 347---350 per Stephen J, and State Bank of New South Wales v Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia [1986] HCA 62 ; (1986) 161 CLR 639 at 650. 29 The first function of the Trust, listed in s 5(1) of the VAC Act, is to control, manage, operate, promote, develop and maintain the Victorian Arts Centre. The land and buildings comprising the Victorian Arts Centre are vested in the Trust, by virtue of s 2(d) of the VAC Act, and by virtue of the vesting of what was formerly Crown land in the Trust's predecessor, the Building Committee, by the 1956 Act. 30 The legislative history, and the terms of the VAC Act, suggest strongly that the principal purpose for the Trust's existence is to hold the title to, and to manage, a major public asset on behalf of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria. That this is the purpose of the VAC Act is confirmed by reference to the speech of the Minister for the Arts upon the second reading of the bill that became the VAC Act. In the course of that speech, the Minister said: 'The Government's investment in the project to date has been substantial. Its commitment to it has been a strong one. This Bill provides a means of protecting that investment by establishing an operating style that is flexible, business-like and expressly designed for the needs of a major performing arts centre. The centre is not just a set of buildings. ' 31 This extract from the second reading speech also suggests that the powers to which I have referred in [17], which I have described as unusual for a government body, have been conferred on the Trust as a means of enabling the better performance by the Trust of its principal function. The unusual powers enable the Trust to act as an impresario and a promoter, so that it can do all that might be thought necessary to manage effectively the important public asset vested in it. When viewed in this way, the unusual powers do not detract from the Trust's otherwise clear status as a government instrumentality. Further, the removal of the employees of the Trust from the area of operation of the Public Sector Management and Employment Act 1998 (Vic), by s 14(4) of the VAC Act, is seen simply as a means of achieving the degree of flexibility thought to be necessary for the Trust to exercise its range of powers. Again, it should not be thought that such flexibility is necessarily inconsistent with the Trust being a government instrumentality, especially when it is viewed in the light of the ancillary nature of the unusual powers. 32 Another significant indicator that the Trust is established to serve a government purpose is the grant to it, by s 18A of the VAC Act of the power to make by-laws. The delegation of legislative power suggests that the Trust carries on governmental activity. See State Bank of New South Wales at 651. 33 The examination of the legislative history, and of the current state of the VAC Act, makes it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Trust is both empowered to serve, and does serve a State Government purpose. That purpose is the control and management of a significant public asset, which successive governments of Victoria have wished to make available for the economic and cultural enrichment of the citizens of Victoria. The information on the Trust's web site confirms this view. The Trust therefore falls clearly within the ordinary meaning of the phrase 'State instrumentality'. 34 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the expression 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award should not bear its ordinary meaning. His submissions were based on the history of the making of the two awards and the circumstances surrounding them. He also advanced a number of other arguments about the construction of the relevant provisions, including the argument that a purposive construction of them should be adopted. The history and context of the awards 35 Prior to 1992, terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry in Victoria were regulated pursuant to Victorian law. By that time, there were two main awards regulating the contract cleaning industry, the Building Services Award and the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award . 36 In or about 1992, the Victorian Government began to contract out the cleaning of government premises. As a consequence, the applicant or one of its predecessor unions applied to the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria to vary the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award . The variation sought was the insertion of a clause that would ensure that the conditions in that Award, which were superior to those in the Building Services Award , would continue to be available to employees cleaning government premises in Victoria, although those employees were employed by contractors and not by the State of Victoria itself. On 21 September 1992, Commissioner Pimm made an order, inserting into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award a new clause, designated as cl 1A Incidence of Award. So far as is relevant to this proceeding, that clause provided: 'The Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award applies to the whole of the State of Victoria for persons engaged in the provision of building services in the occupations of building attendant, caretaker, cleaner, lift attendant or security officer, howsoever designated, employed --- (a) By a contractor engaged by a State Government Department or Instrumentality'. 37 On 29 October 1992, when the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria in full session made a new Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award , to supersede the former award of that name, this incidence clause appeared in Pt A of that award. 38 Counsel for the respondent contended that, both before and after the insertion of the incidence of award clause, cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre were employed by a contractor and were not paid any allowance referable to the Trust being a government instrumentality. He contended that the purpose of the incidence of award clause was solely to ensure that superior terms and conditions of employment enjoyed by cleaners employed by the State of Victoria continued to apply when the State contracted out the cleaning of its premises. 39 Not long after October 1992, there was a substantial flight from Victorian state awards to federal awards, as unions attempted to avoid new Victorian legislation. The applicant attempted to obtain a federal award for cleaners. Employers in the industry opposed this. Although the applicant was successful in overcoming an objection that the Commission had no jurisdiction to make an award, the Commission refused to make an interim award sought by the applicant. On 25 October 1993, a Full Bench of the Commission published a decision following a review of wage fixing principles. Among the principles it laid down for the making of first federal awards was a principle providing that: 'In awards regulating the employment of workers previously covered by a State award or determination, existing State award rates and conditions prima facie will be the proper award rates and conditions. ' 40 Following negotiations about the making of a federal award for the contract cleaning industry, the applicant entered into a memorandum of agreement dated 16 March 1994 ('the memorandum of agreement'), with the Australian Building Services Association, the Property Services Council of Australia, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce & Industry, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and Eski Cleaning Services. That memorandum of agreement provided relevantly as follows: 'The parties agree: 1. To make a joint application for a Federal Award that preserves rates of pay and allowances as they were prescribed for the contract cleaning industry in the expired awards of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria, known as the Building Services Award, the Building Services (State Government Departments & Instrumentalities) Award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-Secondary Education (TAFE) Award and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistants (Government Schools) Award. 2. That the Award made prescribe common conditions of employment for the industry, other than where to prescribe such common conditions of employment would result in a reduction in income contrary to Point 1 of this agreement. It is acknowledged by the parties that the implementation of 1 and 2 of this agreement shall be staged as follows: (a) An initial application to the Commission for a minimum rates award, the scope and Incidence of that award being in similar terms to the Incidence of the former Building Services Award. (b) A second stage where the paid rates applicable in the former paid rates awards applicable to the cleaning industry are incorporated as separate parts into the Building Services Award. ' 41 On 16 March 1994, a representative of the applicant announced the memorandum of agreement to Deputy President Acton of the Commission, and sought the making of an award in accordance with it. In the course of his submissions, the applicant's representative told Deputy President Acton: 'The award that I would be asking that the commission make, arising out of today's proceedings is a minimum rates award, the incidence of which is in similar terms to the incidence of the former Building Services Award of the former Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria. There will be a second stage in the implementation of this agreement at which time the parties will approach the commission and seek to have the award which we would have made today, amended to incorporate rates of pay which were expressed in the former state awards known as the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities award, the Miscellaneous Workers Post-secondary Education TAFE Award, and the Cleaners and Domestic Arts Assistance Government Schools Award, and that will be the subject of subsequent application to the commission, and of course there will need to be detailed negotiations between the parties as to the final form of such variations to the award. ' 42 The applicant's representative also told Deputy President Acton that the proposed award reflected the situation as it was when the Building Services Conciliation and Arbitration Board and the Building Services State Government Departments and Instrumentalities Conciliation and Arbitration Board had been restructured by decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of Victoria on 7 March 1991. The abolition of those boards by statute in August 1992 led to the introduction into the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award of the incidence clause to which I have referred in [36]. The Commission made the consent award, which is the 1994 Award. 43 As had been promised to Deputy President Acton, a further application was made to the Commission to incorporate into the 1994 Award the specific rates derived from several former Victorian awards, including the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award . The Commission heard that application on 20 July 1994. The application was not opposed by representatives of employers, although two of them expressed concern about differential rates within the industry and foreshadowed discussions with a view to absorbing the specific rates into future general increases. Commissioner Bacon accepted the submission of the parties and invited them to submit an order for him to make. This was the origin of cl 8A of the 1994 Award. 44 This history might be of some assistance to the respondent's case if there were any evidence that the non-payment of rates specified in the Building Services (State Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Award to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre had ever been the result of a conscious decision not to apply those rates, or an awareness that, for some reason, they were inapplicable. For present purposes, I am prepared to accept that the construction of an award can be affected by a common understanding of the parties to it about a particular state of affairs. If such a common understanding existed when the award was made, it should not be departed from when the Court comes to construe the award at a subsequent time. Care must be taken, however, to distinguish a common understanding from common inadvertence. If the only reason why the government instrumentality rates were not paid at the Victorian Arts Centre was that neither the union nor the employer adverted to the possibility that there was an obligation to pay them, no common understanding results. In order to have an understanding, it is necessary that there be a meeting of minds, a consensus. There can be no meeting of minds, no consensus, if no-one has thought about the issue. 45 Such evidence as there is in the present case leads to the conclusion that it is only in recent years that the applicant has realised that there is a possibility that those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre have been underpaid. There were several parties to the memorandum of agreement. There is no evidence that any of those parties held a view on the issue at all. In this respect, three significant witnesses gave evidence in this proceeding. Dimitrios Demos was the Operations Manager of the company that became the contractor for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre from the time the Trust took possession of it in 1981. He worked for that company until 1987. During that time, he became its State Manager for Victoria. John Lazzari was the State Manager for Victoria of a predecessor company of the respondent from 1993. He had direct responsibility for overseeing the carrying out of the contract to clean the Victorian Arts Centre. At the time of the transition from State to federal regulation of terms and conditions of employment in the contract cleaning industry, Mr Lazzari was State President of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia, which he said was incorrectly described in the memorandum of agreement to which I have referred in [40] as the Property Services Council of Australia. In that capacity, he was a signatory of the memorandum of agreement. John Grant was on the State Executive of the Building Services Contractors Association of Australia at the time of the transition. None of these three witnesses gave any evidence suggestive of a common understanding between the applicant or its predecessor and any employer, or employer association involved in the contract cleaning industry, to the effect that the Victorian Arts Centre was not regarded as premises of a State Government instrumentality. It is clear that no-one adverted to the status of the Trust, and to whether it was a State Government instrumentality for the purposes of either the earlier State award or the 1994 Award. 46 It is not the case that the applicant has changed its mind and gone back on a common understanding. It is the case that no common understanding ever existed. Other construction arguments 47 The adoption of a purposive construction of the 1994 Award does not assist the respondent. Even if the purpose can be ascertained from the express statements of the subjective intentions of the parties to the process of making the 1994 Award, acceptance that the purpose was to reproduce the situation as it had been in Victoria does not answer the question whether there existed an obligation to pay the government instrumentality rates to those employed as cleaners at the Victorian Arts Centre. The stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement was to preserve rates of pay 'as they were prescribed'. If it could be shown that some provision of the earlier Victorian award excluded those employed to clean the premises of the Trust, the stated purpose of the memorandum of agreement would not be fulfilled if the 1994 Award, which was the result of the agreement expressed in the memorandum of agreement, were to be construed as including the Trust's premises. No such provision existed. On no view can an examination of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award, by itself or in the context of other provisions of the 1994 Award, yield a purpose as specific as the exclusion of the Trust from the concept of a State Government instrumentality. The purpose was to provide higher rates of pay for those employed in cleaning in the premises of 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities'. The question remains whether that concept includes or excludes the Trust. 48 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in relation to industrial instruments operating in Victoria by the time the 1994 Award was made. To establish this proposition, he tendered a copy of the original print of the Metal Industry (Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities) Interim Award 1981 ('the Metal Industry Award'), dated 14 October 1981. Clause 2 of the Metal Industry Award provided: '2 --- PARTIES BOUND This award shall be binding upon members of The Amalgamated Metal Workers' and Shipwrights Union, Australasian Society of Engineers, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, The Federated Ironworkers' Association of Australia and the Victorian Government Departments and Instrumentalities named hereunder in respect of their employees performing work covered by this award. In Part 1: Country Roads Board, Victoria. Forests Commission of Victoria. Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria. Housing Commission, Victoria. Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works. Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board. State Rivers and Water Supply Commission, Victoria. In Part 2: State Electricity Commission of Victoria In Part 3: Geelong Harbour Trust Commissioners. Port of Melbourne Authority. Portland Harbour Trust Commissioners. ' 49 Just how the making of the Metal Industry Award could operate to create a term of art for industrial instruments is unclear. The organisations that later amalgamated to form the applicant were not parties to the Metal Industry Award, and therefore played no part in the choice of bodies named. Mr Lazzari, who was a signatory to the memorandum of agreement referred to in [40], gave evidence that he was not aware of the list in the Metal Industry Award. It is unlikely that the concept of a State Government department or instrumentality could be frozen in time by a specific listing in one award. In any event, the list included 'Her Majesty the Queen In Right of the State of Victoria', an entity apt to include all statutory bodies entitled to the immunity of the Crown in right of the State of Victoria. On the basis that the Trust is such a body, it would be comprehended by the list in the Metal Award. 50 Although three witnesses with long experience of the contract cleaning industry gave evidence on behalf of the respondent, no witness gave evidence to the effect that the phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' had become a term of art in the industry, whether as a result of the Metal Industry Award or otherwise. 51 Counsel for the respondent attempted to rely on the capitalisation of the initial letter of the word 'Instrumentalities' in each of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, as well as in the earlier Victorian award, as indicative that a particular meaning of the word had been intended. Capitalisation of the initial letters of words in headings is a common practice. Inappropriate capitalisation of the initial letters of words, when not used in headings, is also common. It is unlikely to indicate the use of a term of art. In any event, if a conscious decision had been made to use the word 'Instrumentalities' as a term of art, the option of defining it in the award was available. It is unlikely that whoever drafted the 1994 Award made a conscious decision to use a term of art, and to indicate that a term of art had been used solely by the use of an initial capital letter. I do not accept that the fact that the word 'Instrumentality' has a capital initial in the 1994 Award and the earlier Victorian award that replaced it can be said to be indicative of a term of art. This is so, even when the word is contrasted with the word 'instrumentality' in the clause considered by the High Court in the Anti-Cancer Council case. 52 Counsel for the respondent also attempted to argue that I should have regard to possible anomalies that might arise from the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award to high-rise buildings, occupied by a mix of tenants, only some of which were State Government entities. This argument is completely irrelevant to the present case. There is no suggestion that the Victorian Arts Centre is occupied by any entity other than the Trust. The question of multiple occupancy of buildings and the application of cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award is dealt with in Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union v Prestige Property Services Pty Ltd [2005] FCA 408 , a judgment delivered subsequent to the hearing of the present case. 53 For these reasons, I am persuaded that the word 'Instrumentalities' when used in the composite phrase 'State Government Departments and Instrumentalities' in cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award is used in its ordinary and natural meaning. When so used, as I have already found, it encompasses the Trust. Conclusion and orders 54 It follows that the respondent has been in breach of its obligations, imposed by cl 8A(a)(ii) of the 1994 Award and cl 15.3.1(b) of the 2003 Award, to pay the allowances required by those clauses to its employees engaged in performing cleaning services at the Victorian Arts Centre. 55 Section 178(2) of the WR Act provides that multiple breaches of a term of an award, arising out of a course of conduct, are to be treated as a single breach. Counsel for the applicant accepted that all breaches of the 1994 Award were to be treated as a single breach and all breaches of the 2003 Award were to be treated as another single breach. This involves the concession that each of the relevant clauses contains a single 'term', for the purposes of s 178 of the WR Act. I am prepared to accept this concession in the present case. 56 The maximum penalty applicable is $10 000 for each breach. There has been an increase in the maximum amount, by amendment to the WR Act since the proceeding was commenced, but counsel for the applicant conceded that the earlier maximum is the appropriate one. In fixing the appropriate penalty, I bear in mind that the real penalty for the respondent will be the necessity to make the payments of underpaid entitlements, together with interest, to each of the employees underpaid. This will be an expensive exercise for the respondent. It will have an effect on the profitability of the contract under which the respondent is responsible for the cleaning of the Victorian Arts Centre. I accept that that contract was negotiated without regard to the need to pay the allowances specified by the 1994 Award and the 2003 Award. Some reference was made to the possibility of renegotiating the contract in light of the outcome of this proceeding. Whether that can be done, and the Trust can be induced to pay a greater sum in respect of work already done, I do not know. I also accept that, at least until recent times, the breaches have arisen from inadvertence, and not from a deliberate intention to underpay. No suggestion was made that the respondent had a record of prior breaches of awards. The only aggravating factor appears to be the want of any contrition. In his evidence, Mr Lazzari was very dismissive of the claim, describing it as 'frivolous'. Obviously, there was a need for the respondent to look more closely at its obligations, when the issue was first raised by the applicant. 57 It is also necessary to acknowledge the need for deterrence in an industry in which Mr Grant, who has held several offices in the Building Services Contractors Association over a long period, acknowledged that there is some non-compliance with awards. 58 Taking all these factors into account, it is appropriate to fix the penalty at $2000 in respect of the breach of the term of the 1994 Award and $1500 in respect of the breach of the term of the 2003 Award. The usual order is that a penalty be paid to the party seeking its imposition. There was no submission that such an order would be inappropriate in the present case. Pursuant to s 356 of the WR Act, there will be an order that each penalty be paid to the applicant. 59 I also propose to make an order that the respondent pay to each of the persons it employed at the Victorian Arts Centre the amount agreed to be outstanding. To each amount there should be added interest, pursuant to s 179A of the WR Act. In this respect, the applicant's claim is modest. Because of the difficulty of calculation of interest when it is payable on a series of payments that were due over a long period, the applicant has asked for interest only from 1 June 2003, ie. on the total sum owed to each employee in respect of the two periods claimed. The applicant calculated that interest only up to the date when the case was being heard. It should be calculated to the date of judgment. As to the rate, the applicant sought interest at 11 per cent per annum, that being the operative rate at 1 June 2003, pursuant to the Penalty Interest Rate Act 1983 (Vic). It is appropriate to choose that rate for the reasons advanced in EMCL Pty Ltd v Esanda Finance Corporation Ltd (No. 2) (1998) 160 ALR 382 at 384, and Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Givoni Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 1406 at [91] . The rate of interest was increased to 11.25 per cent from 26 June 2003, and to 12 per cent from 1 July 2004, but counsel for the applicant forwent any entitlement to a rate greater than 11 per cent. The order that I make for payment to each employee will therefore include an amount of interest on the sum owing to that employee at 1 June 2003, at the rate of 11 per cent per annum (non-compounding), from 1 June 2003 to the date of judgment. 60 The case is covered by s 347 of the WR Act, so no question of cost arises. I certify that the preceding sixty (60) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gray. Associate: Dated: 23 January 2006 Counsel for the applicant: C Dowling Solicitor for the applicant: Australian Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union Counsel for the respondent: MD Murphy Solicitor for the respondent: Tanya Cirkovic & Associates Dates of Hearing: 15, 16 March 2005 Date of Judgment: 23 January 2006 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/11.html","title":"06_11.txt","id":"13"},{"snippet":"I made orders on 16 November 2009 approving the proposed scheme of arrangement (Scheme) and exempting the plaintiff, GRD Limited (GRD), from compliance with the provisions of s 411(11) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act). I indicated then that I would deliver written reasons in due course. These are my reasons. On 1 October 2009 (the First Court Hearing) the Court granted approval to GRD for the convening of a meeting (Scheme Meeting) to consider the Scheme. The Scheme, if approved and implemented, will result in GRD becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC Australia Finance Company Limited (AMEC). GRD now seeks an order approving of the Scheme pursuant to s 411(4)(b) of the Corporations Act and an order exempting it pursuant to s 411(12) of the Corporations Act from compliance with s 411(11) of the Corporations Act . The application is supported by the following affidavits: Affidavits before the Court at the First Hearing on 1 October 2009 (a) Mark Clifford Lawrenson sworn 8 September 2009 (the First Lawrenson Affidavit); (b) Garrick John Archer sworn 30 September 2009 (the First Archer Affidavit). Affidavits before the Court since the First Hearing on 1 October 2009 (c) Garrick John Archer sworn 11 November 2009 (the Second Archer Affidavit); (d) Melissa Stevens sworn 12 November 2009 (the Stevens Affidavit); (e) Richard Fairfax Court sworn 11 November 2009 (the Chairman's Affidavit); (f) Mark Clifford Lawrenson sworn 12 November 2009 (the Second Lawrenson Affidavit); (g) Desmond John Barrie sworn 12 November 2009; and (h) Garrick John Archer sworn 16 November 2009. On 1 October 2009, by Order 1, I approved, pursuant to s 411(1) , the explanatory memorandum and Scheme Booklet in its final form. Events subsequent to 1 October 2009 orders On 9 October 2009 Computershare Communication Services Pty Ltd assembled packages of the materials in relation to the Scheme and posted them to the Shareholders. The materials sent to each Shareholder were: (a) a copy of the Scheme Booklet; (b) a personalised Proxy Form for the Scheme Meeting; and (c) a reply paid envelope addressed to Computershare. On 9 October 2009 the solicitors for GRD lodged a copy of the Scheme Booklet with ASIC for registration under s 412(6) of the Corporations Act . An advertisement concerning the Scheme Meeting, and giving notice of the hearing before this Court on 16 November 2009 to consider and, if thought fit, approve the Scheme was published in 'The West Australian' newspaper on 11 November 2009. The Scheme Meeting was held on 10 November 2009. The resolution to approve the Scheme was conducted by poll. 68.33% of Shareholders present in person or by proxy at the Scheme Meeting voted in favour of the Scheme. 31.67% voted against the Scheme. The votes in favour of the Scheme represented 95.93% of the votes cast on the resolution. Accordingly the majority voting requirements under s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Corporations Act have been met. All of the Conditions of the Scheme have been satisfied or waived. Following the above advertisement neither GRD nor the solicitors for GRD have received any notice or appearance or other communication from any party intending to appear at the Court hearing which occurred on 16 November 2009 in this proceeding, save for notice from AMEC that it intended to appear at that hearing. I am satisfied that all GRD Shareholders received sufficient notification of this Court hearing and were adequately informed of their right to be heard at, and to oppose the application for approval of, the Scheme. ASIC wrote to the plaintiff's solicitors by letter dated 12 November 2009 confirming, under s 411(17)(b) of the Corporations Act , that it has no objection to the Scheme. Legal principles Section 411(4)(b) provides a discretion to the Court. At the approval stage, the Court considers matters that do not precisely correlate to those considered at the first meeting approval stage. At the approval stage, the Court, in this case, must be satisfied that: (a) the meeting convened by GRD was convened and held in accordance with the orders made on 1 October 2009; (b) the explanatory memorandum and Scheme Booklet was sent with every notice of such meeting; (c) the resolutions were passed at the meeting by the majority required by s 411(4)(a)(ii) of the Corporations Act ; (d) GRD has otherwise complied with the orders made on 1 October 2009; and (e) ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the explanatory statement and to make submissions to the Court in relation thereto as required by s 412(7) of the Corporations Act . The opportunity to be accorded to ASIC under s 412(7) of the Corporations Act is in addition to that provided for prior to the first meeting approval stage by s 411(2). The Court has additionally a residual discretion to withhold approval which is a long standing and recognised power: Re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas & Pacific Junction Railway Company [1891] 1 Ch 213 at 243. It has more recently been confirmed in Re NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 408 ; (2000) 156 FLR 412 at [21] - [24] , Re Hudson Conway Ltd (2000) 33 ACSR 657: Re Kalgoorlie Lake View Pty Ltd (2005) 56 ACSR 144. A passage from the judgment of Santow J in Re NRMA Ltd [2000] NSWSC 408 ; 156 FLR 412 at [21] - [24] is frequently cited: [21] Finally, I should record again what I said in my earlier judgment regarding the Court's task at the approval stage. First, the Court must be satisfied that there has been no misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 995 of the Corporations Law which is of such materiality as to vitiate the vote. The Court's discretion to give or withhold approval at the approval hearing remains unfettered by what has occurred at the convening hearing. That approval may be given or withheld, or given on conditions. It will take account of what has been revealed or transpired since the convening hearing, as well as any matters properly raised at the approval hearing. As regards the scheme proxy, my earlier provisional conclusion not precluding its use needs now to be reviewed following the scheme meetings and in light of the voting at those meetings on the scheme and on those associated resolutions already passed. The intention is for the demutualisation special resolution to be held reasonably soon after the scheme, this having, as my earlier judgment makes clear, direct relevance to the legitimacy of the scheme proxy. So too does the very strong support for the scheme at around 80% or more assuming reliable voting figures: see paras 72 and 73 of my earlier judgment. [22] At [41] of my earlier judgment I conclude: Once the approval stage is reached, the court's task is well settled, and accurately set out in I A Renard and J G Santamaria \"Takeovers and ReconstructionsG9 in Australia\", Butterworths (looseleaf) at 15,061: ... the court will determine: (1) whether all the conditions required by CL s 411 have been complied with; (2) whether the majority of members or creditors, though acting regularly, have acted in good faith and not in pursuit of some illegitimate purpose; and (3) whether the proposal was `at least so far fair and reasonable, as that an intelligent and honest man, who is a member of that class, and acting alone in respect of his interest as such member, might approve it' (Per Fry LJ in Re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railway Co [1891] 1 Ch 213 at 247). Fundamentally, the jurisdiction is supervisory; the court is concerned to be satisfied that there has been an absence of oppression and that the compromise or arrangement is one which is capable of being accepted: see Re Dorman Long & Co Ltd [1934] Ch 635 ; Scottish Insurance Corp Ltd v Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd [1949] UKHL 3 ; [1949] AC 462 at 486. [23] When it comes to appraising the fairness of a scheme, the Court does not determine that the scheme is intrinsically in the members' interest or otherwise. As White J said in Re Pheon Pty Ltd (1987) 47 SASR 427 at 435 in dealing with a creditors' scheme of arrangement but equally applicable to a members' scheme: \"The court must leave it to the commercial sense of the creditors to judge what is reasonable in their interests. After all, it is their money which is at stake. \" [24] That limited supervisory role of the court in a share scheme was again affirmed in a recent Victorian case: Re Hudson Conway Limited (2000) 33 ACSR 657. Apposite also is the observation of Warren J in Re Timor Sea Petroleum NL (2000) 35 ACSR 186 at [37]: The principle applied on an application for approval of a scheme to which no objection has been made is that if the court is satisfied that there has been an absence of oppression and that the relevant scheme is one capable of being accepted by the shareholders it should be approved... On the basis of the principles expressed in Re Hudson Conway Ltd (2000) 22 ACSR 657 by Beach J at 662, 665, 667, it is appropriate to regard the shareholders as the best judges of whether these schemes are to their commercial advantage. In light of the passing of the resolutions and, in particular, the majorities achieved, it is apparent that the shareholders have resolved that the schemes are to their commercial advantage. Application to this matter I am satisfied that the formal requirements of Part 5.1 have been met. The Scheme has been overwhelmingly approved by members. No member or creditor has provided any indication to GRD that it proposes to oppose the orders sought. ASIC has been kept fully and thoroughly informed at all stages of the process. I do not see any basis for the Court to exercise its residual power to withhold approval of the Scheme. Shareholders will receive substantial benefits from the Scheme. The independent expert has concluded that the Scheme is in the best interests of GRD Shareholders. Although, the independent expert concluded that the scheme consideration was not fair but reasonable, the basis of this conclusion was expressed clearly and openly in the Independent Experts' Report. The Independent Expert's opinion was broadly that the Scheme (being the offer of 55c per GRD Share) is \"in the best interests of GRD shareholders\", and though not fair it was reasonable. It was explained, in summary, in the amended Independent Expert's Report this way: Opinion In Grant Samuels's opinion, the Proposal is in the best interests of GRD shareholders. The Proposal does not deliver a full premium for control. However, unless a superior alternative proposal emerges before the Scheme meeting, GRD shareholders are likely to be better off voting in favour of the Proposal. Valuation of GRD is subject to considerable uncertainty given the range of valuation conclusions that could be reached in relation to the Lancashire Waste Project. Accordingly, other factors need to be taken account as to whether the Proposal is in the best interests of GRD shareholders. The assessment of the Proposal is an overall conclusion having regard to all these factors. Grant Samuel has valued GRD in the range of $133.7-185.1 million, or 69.5-96.2 cents per share. The valuation reflects the estimated full underlying value for GRD and exceeds the price at which Grant Samuel would expect GRD shares to trade in the absence of the Proposal or speculation regarding some alternative corporate transaction. The consideration under the Proposal of 55 cents per share is less than Grant Samuel's estimate of the full underlying value of GRD. Accordingly, the Proposal is not in the fair value range. This suggests that GRD shareholders have not been offered a full premium for control. It can be argued that GRD shareholders need not accept an offer that is not \"fair\": alternative proposals could emerge. There are no impediments to an alternative proposal and there is ample time for an alternative proposal to be made before the Scheme meeting; if the Proposal is rejected, AMEC may improve its offer; GRD could ultimately deliver value above 55 cents through the sale of its interest in Global Renewables following commissioning of the Lancashire Waste Project, albeit in the medium term; and the Proposal has been put forward in a period of adverse market conditions for GRD Minproc and during the construction phase of the Lancashire Waste Project. It may not be the optimal time for shareholders to sell. On the other hand: given the uncertainty of judgements regarding GRD's valuation (particularly in relation to the Lancashire Waste Project), the conclusion that the Proposal is not \"fair\" needs to be treated with some caution. It should be recognised that there remains significant risk associated with the Lancashire Waste Project. If no value is attributed to Global Renewables (i.e. the gross value for the Lancashire Waste Project is less than the project senior debt) the value range for GRD would be $96.7-122.1 million (50.3-63.5 cents per share) and the consideration under the Proposal would be within the fair value range; GRD Minproc and Global Renewables are entirely different businesses and it is difficult to envisage buyers equally interested in both. Inevitably an offeror for GRD would discount the value of one of the businesses; The Proposal is the only firm offer that has been received. The scheme process establishes a clear value benchmark and a defined timetable within which alternative interested parties could act. If no superior proposal is received prior to the Scheme meeting it could be argued that the Proposal represents fair value; and there is no evidence to suggest that AMEC would improve its offer. Furthermore, in considering whether the Proposal is reasonable, the following factors have been taken into account: GRD is relatively highly geared and is required to repay $55.3 million of deferred purchase consideration by 30 June 2010. In the absence of the Proposal and given the continuation of current market conditions, GRD faces significant refinancing risk over the next 12 months and is likely to need to raise equity; if the Proposal is approved, shareholders will receive 55 cents cash. GRD shares have not traded above 55 cents since October 2008 despite improving equity markets and the Proposal; and if the Proposal is rejected, under current market conditions GRD shares are likely to trade below 55 cents for the foreseeable future, particularly in view of the risk associated with the Lancashire Waste Project and the refinancing risk facing GRD. It is Grant Samuel's judgement that, if no superior proposal emerges prior to the Scheme meeting, there are sufficient reasons for shareholders to vote for the Proposal notwithstanding that it is not in the fair range value. Therefore, in Grant Samuel's opinion, the Proposal is not fair but reasonable and, accordingly, the Proposal is in the best interests of shareholders. The Court at the First Court Hearing was referred to the decision of Dodds-Streeton J in Zenyth Therapeutics Ltd v Smith (2006) 60 ACSR 548 and, in particular, at [109] - [114]: 109 In Re Rancoo Ltd , Hayne J referred to ASIC Policy Statement 75 and expressed reservations about the attribution of different meanings to the concepts \"fair\" and \"reasonable\". He acknowledged the difficulty in accepting that an offer which was not fair could still be reasonable. 110 Hayne J stated: \"Policy statement 75 expresses the views of the commission about the expression \"fair and reasonable\". It does so in a way that seeks to attribute different meanings to the words \"fair and reasonable\". The policy statement does not treat the expression \"fair and reasonable\" as a single portmanteau statement conveying a meaning to the listener but, rather, seeks to take each element of the expression and attribute a different meaning to it. Thus, the policy statement expressly contemplates the circumstance that an expert might conclude that a particular offer is not fair but nevertheless is reasonable. I must say that, for myself, I find the proposition that an offer may be 'not fair' and yet still 'reasonable' one which presents some difficulty. Perhaps that view stems from the impression I have that the expression 'fair and reasonable' is but a single expression intended to convey a single overall meaning which is not to be identified by reference to particular constituent elements. \" 111 Hayne J observed that \"the net effect of the two transactions is thus, an effect which leads to the overall benefit of the remaining shareholders of Rancoo by a considerable sum, and it is on that basis that the expert concluded that the selective capital reduction is reasonable\". 112 Despite his reservations, Hayne J confirmed the reduction of capital, which was unopposed. He stated that \"Thus the reduction that has been proposed is a step that is to be taken, as a part of that overall transaction\". 113 There is great force in Hayne J's reservations about an offer which, although not fair, is nevertheless reasonable. Although Re Rancoo Ltd constitutes an example of a reduction of capital which was recognised to be such, persuasive applications of the distinction are likely to be rare. 114 Courts should adopt a cautious approach to the approval of any scheme which the independent expert considers \"not fair\", particularly when it may involve expropriation at an undervalue. In my opinion, a scheme involving an offer of an undervalue, which is not fair, should generally not be considered reasonable unless it is accompanied by some positive compensatory feature. The fact that the security holders are unable to exact fair, or better, consideration through any avenue alternative to the scheme would not necessarily render an unfair scheme reasonable in the relevant sense. (footnotes omitted) I accepted at the First Court Hearing that the content of the amended Independent Expert's Report, a summary of which I have set out above, accommodated the type of concerns expressed by Hayne J in Re Rancoo (1995) 17 ACSR 206 and Dodds-Streeton J in Zenyth Therapeutics 60 ACSR 548. I remain of that opinion. It was disclosed at the First Court Hearing that ASIC was content with the Independent Expert's Report and the form of the Scheme Booklet (as amended). There is no evidence that the Scheme is not being proposed in good faith or that it is commercially immoral in any respect. The reasons underlying the Scheme have been clearly stated and put to all GRD members. All conditions to the Scheme will on the making of the orders sought in the minute of proposed orders either have been satisfied or waived, or in the case of 'negative conditions' will not have occurred. The GRD Options All the holders of GRD Options have entered into cancellation deeds under which their GRD Options will be cancelled upon the Scheme becoming effective. Exemption from section 411(11) of the Corporations Act Section 411(11) requires, subject to s 411(12) , that a copy of the Court's order approving the Scheme be annexed to every copy of the relevant Company's Constitution issued after the order is made. Section 411(12) allows the Court to exempt a body from compliance with this provision or to determine the period during which it shall comply. Orders under s 411(12) have been made in a number of cases, including Re Hudson Conway Ltd 33 ACSR 657 at 668, Re Amcor Ltd [2000] VSC 157 ; 34 ACSR 199 at 209, Re Glencore Nickel Pty Ltd (2003) 44 ACSR 210 at 225 and Re Anaconda Nickel Holdings Pty Ltd (2003) 44 ACSR 229 at 240. In my opinion, exemption from compliance with s 411(11) is appropriate for the following reasons. The current GRD Shareholders are fully informed of the Scheme. Once the Scheme becomes binding on GRD Shareholders any purported transfers of GRD Shares will not be accepted for registration, other than a transfer to AMEC in accordance with the Scheme. Accordingly, new shareholders (apart from GRD) will not be entered into GRD's register of members once the Scheme becomes binding. Upon full implementation of the Scheme, GRD will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC. Further, the Court order approving the Scheme would effect no alteration to GRD's Constitution. Orders For these reasons there will be orders approving the Scheme and exempting GRD from compliance with s 411(11) of the Corporations Act . I certify that the preceding thirty-nine (39) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour. Associate: Dated: 24 December 2009 Counsel for the Plaintiff: Mr G Donaldson SC Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Hardy Bowen Date of Hearing: 1 October, 16 November 2009 Date of Judgment: 16 November 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1595.html","title":"09_1595.txt","id":"14"},{"snippet":"This is an application for an order that WR Estates Pty Ltd be wound up in insolvency under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The application was filed on 6 November 2009. The application relies upon a failure on the part of the company to comply with a demand within the period for compliance set out in s 459F(2) of the Corporations Act . The matter came before the court some three weeks ago and on that occasion, Mrs Victoria Walters applied for leave to appear on behalf of the company. The relevant director of the company is Mr Walters, the husband of Mrs Victoria Walters. On that occasion, Mrs Walters was accompanied by her son and she sought an adjournment of the application, essentially on two grounds. The first ground was that Mr and Mrs Walters had entered into a contract for the sale of a property at a price of $610,000. Settlement of that property was programmed to occur on 14 January 2010 and the net proceeds after the discharge of encumbrances was said to be approximately $120,000. Mrs Walters, on behalf of the company, sought the adjournment on the footing that those funds, when they became available at settlement, would be paid to the plaintiff and there was some discussion of the possibility of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation making arrangements to attend at settlement and obtain a bank cheque for the balance funds. Those funds would then have come from the sale of an interest in the property by the vendors which is not the company itself. In addition to those matters, Mrs Walters's son was present and he was invited to approach the bar table and advise the court what circumstances were then prevailing. He told the court that he was in the process of seeking to raise funds in relation to a property development project and his expectation was that an approval was likely to occur before 23 December 2009 and, once an approval was obtained, he intended to make $500,000 of the approved funds available to his parents to enable them to discharge the balance of the debt to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation. On that occasion, I advised Mrs Walters that I would adjourn the matter until 23 December 2009 on the basis that the contract was likely to settle on January 2010 and that Mrs Walters's son had an expectation that a finance approval might be forthcoming by the return date. On the return date, the court would examine the extent to which Mrs Walters and her son had been able to make good some of the things which would influence the question of whether a winding-up order ought to be made. I also directed Mrs Walters and her son to file affidavits deposing to the various matters which had been put to the court from the bar table. I pointed out at that time that the statements made were simply statements from the bar table and they would need to be put in the form of affidavits as admissible evidence, as statements from the bar table do not constitute evidence of the matters upon which they would seek to rely as informing the question of whether a winding-up order ought to be made or whether the application ought to be further adjourned. Subsequently, Mrs Walters prepared an affidavit as did her son, Gary John Rose, and Mrs Walters sought to fax those documents to the court. The Registry refused to accept them in the form in which they were proffered. I have seen a facsimile of those affidavits and I have before me now the original affidavits. Accordingly, I give leave to read and file the affidavit of Victoria Walters sworn 21 December 2009, and I give leave to read and file the affidavit of Gary John Rose, the son of Mrs Walters, also sworn 21 December 2009. The affidavit of Gary Rose is quite short and simply says that he is making his best endeavours: ...to seek and obtain finance with my own property and I state that I intend to gift my mother Victoria Walters the sum of $500,000 to assist them in paying their current ATO Bill. The affidavit does not provide any content to the application for finance. Nor does it identify who the financier might be, the state of the application, whether there is any preliminary approval subject to conditions, or any of those sorts of matters. The affidavit is simply one paragraph and it is handwritten. It gives no content or substance to those matters. Mrs Walters has also filed an affidavit which goes to the question of the contract and the settlement date in 2010. I pointed out on the last occasion the matter was before the court that it would be very important for Mr Walters, the director of the company, to appear and seek leave to appear on behalf of the company or, alternatively, to appear by lawyers. Unfortunately, Mr Walters is engaged in the business of the company and is not appearing before the court and is not seeking leave to represent the company. Mrs Walters is present and she seeks leave to appear on behalf of the company in relation to these matters. I give leave to Mrs Walters to appear on behalf of WR Estates Pty Ltd. She seeks a further adjournment of the matter. Mrs Walters, and thus the company, asks for an adjournment essentially on two grounds. The first is that the contract of sale which was previously before the court and is now before the court again is scheduled for settlement on 14 January 2010, and the court is advised by Mrs Walters that the net balance upon settlement after discharge of encumbrances will be $120,000. Therefore, it is put that the matter ought to be adjourned as these funds will become available to the Commissioner in part-discharge of the debt. The second basis upon which the matter is sought to be adjourned is that Mrs Walters has assembled a range of contracts which WR Estates Pty Ltd, as a real estate agent, has been instrumental in securing between various vendors and purchasers, and it is said that the commissions due to the company arising from this parcel of contracts will be $364,000. It is said that these commissions will flow into the company in the period January to March 2010. Thus it is said that the net proceeds from the contract of sale of the house property will be available by 14 January 2010, and the cash-flows from these commissions will be available between January and March 2010. It follows, it is said, that the debt due to the Commissioner will be fully discharged by March 2010. The plaintiff has sought certain material from the defendant and a letter has been put before the court from accountants called Farr RasmussenLucas dated 22 December 2009 marked \"To whom it may concern\". The letter seeks to identify the steps that the accountants are required to undertake and the difficulties of undertaking those steps within the immediate period due to the forthcoming Christmas break and other circumstances. The debt due to the Commissioner is a debt of $333,274.02. It represents the amount due and owing on a running balance in respect of the company's taxation affairs and interest on that running balance. The period of the debt in relation to the taxation obligation is for the financial years ending 2005 to 2009. In that sense, the amount claimed by the Commissioner as a debt due to the Commonwealth in respect of tax obligations (ultimately on behalf of the people of Australia) is a significant sum and is outstanding over a reasonably lengthy period. The effect, of course, of the failure of the company to comply with a statutory demand made upon it for payment of the amount recited in the demand notice is that a presumption of insolvency arises. That presumption is, of course, rebuttable. However, it is perfectly plain that the presumption of insolvency has not been rebutted and what is put forward is that a discretion ought to be exercised to adjourn the matter to enable further steps to be investigated by the accountants and then implemented with a view to discharging the debt over a period, in effect, from January to March 2010, at the outer boundary of the proposed payment period. The merits of that matter are said to be, of course, that there are demonstrated cash-flows and that there will be further funds arising out of additional contracts. However, the position seems to me to be that the company has not been able to demonstrate or rebut the presumption of insolvency. The company seeks an adjournment to enable further matters to be investigated and steps implemented which might have the effect of discharging the debt. The company continues to trade in circumstances where there is a presumption of insolvency and, since the company has not been able to put forward clear, comprehensive affidavits arising out of the matters raised on the last occasion the matter was before the court, which depose to all of the relevant matters, I am satisfied that the company is insolvent and that the presumption of insolvency has not been rebutted. I am satisfied that a discretion ought not to be exercised to further adjourn the matter, in all the circumstances. Accordingly, I propose to make an order that the defendant be wound up in insolvency under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), and an order that a liquidator be appointed. I will further order that the costs of the plaintiff are paid out of the assets of the defendant. Accordingly, I make orders in terms of the draft orders which will be: WR Estates Pty Ltd ACN 111 955 572 be wound up in insolvency under the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). Gregory Michael Maloney, an official liquidator, be appointed liquidator of the company. The plaintiff's costs be fixed in the sum of $1137.31 and reimbursed in accordance with section 466(2) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). I certify that the preceding twenty (20) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Greenwood.

The orders require consideration of the appropriate course of the winding up; that is, whether the scheme should be wound up immediately, by the appointment of liquidators or receivers with the usual functions, or whether the scheme should be wound up in a manner that permits the completion of the residential development the subject of the scheme. In addition, consideration needs to be given to the appropriate personal entity who should have carriage of the winding up and the precise terms upon which the winding up should proceed. 2 The plaintiffs' application is supported by an affidavit sworn on 9 October 2006 of Mr Brian McNamara, a Director of the first and third plaintiffs and a person authorised by the second plaintiff to make an affidavit on its behalf. Additionally there are two affidavits of M/s Glenda Currie of the plaintiffs' solicitors sworn on 5 and 13 December 2006 respectively. The defendant relies on the affidavit of Mr Steven Shadgett, an investigator with the Enforcement Directorate of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Western Australian office sworn on 18 October 2006. PLAINTIFFS' EVIDENCE 3 The relevant circumstances appear from the affidavit of Mr McNamara. The first plaintiff is a trustee of the Lake Coogee Estate Development Trust (the Unit Trust). The Unit Trust issued an information memorandum inviting investments by way of the purchase of units in the Trust. The memorandum set out information concerning the purchase, subdivision and sale of approximately 56 residential lots at the Lake Coogee Estate. This invitation for investments through the Unit Trust and the management of the development with a view to securing returns for unit holders is collectively described as 'the scheme'. 4 On 28 September 2006 ASIC wrote to the plaintiffs' solicitors threatening an application to wind up the scheme. The foundation for this contention was that the various activities involved in the development, constituting the scheme, resulted in it being a management investment scheme under ch 5C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act). 5 The orders which the plaintiffs seek are that the scheme not be wound up immediately but be wound up after opportunity has been given for completion of the development. The form of orders which they seek would be made up as follows. There would be a definitional section in which the foregoing events would be defined. The first order would be undertakings by the plaintiffs not to take any further steps in offering interests and related matters. The second order envisages undertakings from the second and third plaintiffs that they will use their best endeavours to assist the first plaintiff in the winding up of the scheme. Thirdly, it would be declared that the scheme constitutes a Management Investment Scheme under ch 5C of the Act operated by the plaintiffs, which was required to be registered under s 601EB of the Act and which was not so registered in contravention of s 601ED(5) of the Act. Fourthly, it would be ordered that the scheme be wound up pursuant to s 601E(1) of the Act and the first plaintiff appointed to wind up the scheme in accordance with the compliance plan and subject to the supervision and direction of the supervisor, namely, Mr Shaun Fraser of McGrath Nichol. It is proposed that the winding up is to involve 'Scheme Completion' which is defined to mean the completion of sales of all proposed lots comprising the subdivided real property, the final distribution of net proceeds to investors, and the proper completion and discharge of all other aspects of the scheme. The orders make provision that the plaintiffs are to provide the supervisor with unrestricted access to the scheme, books and records. Further, the first plaintiff is to provide monthly reports to the supervisor detailing all receipts and expenditure incurred and reporting on the progress of the winding up of the scheme; and quarterly reports to investors on the progress of the scheme. Further, the supervisor is to be ordered to provide quarterly reports to the Court and to the defendant detailing the progress made up to the date of each report to achieve Scheme Completion in accordance with the compliance plan and other relevant financial details. Finally, it is also to be ordered that the first plaintiff must, within 21 days of completing the winding up of the scheme, provide to the Court and the parties (verified on oath) a report of the actions taken by the plaintiffs in the winding up and all receipts and payments made in the winding up and in complying with the proposed orders. 6 The reason these orders are sought is set out in Mr McNamara's affidavit. He states that the development was set up, using the Unit Trust, as a vehicle for investors to derive financial gain in the manner set out in the information memorandum. The involvement of the various plaintiffs in the development to date has been as follows. The second plaintiff acquired the land, using in part loan funds advanced to it by the first plaintiff. A facility deed was entered into and a deed of charge secured this loan. The first plaintiff entered into a written agreement with the second plaintiff to manage the development of the scheme (the Management and Service Agreement). The third plaintiff provides project management, consulting and other services to the first plaintiff in its performance of the Management and Service Agreement. 7 The first plaintiff has entered into contracts to sell 42 of the 63 lots comprising the development. It has received deposits totalling $633 000 from the purchasers of the 42 lots. Mr McNamara anticipates that in the normal course of the scheme the remaining 21 lots will be sold within three to six months. He anticipates that construction will begin around March 2007 and be completed around September 2007. He envisages the scheme will then be wound up and capital and profit shares distributed to investors by December 2007. Projections have been prepared by the first plaintiff in respect of the probable net profit and returns to unit holders. The projections show that the projected net profit is likely to be sufficient to enable the 'A' class unit holders to receive 100 per cent of the first $1.575 million; the 'B' class unit holders to receive a 100 per cent of the further net income, that is, in a range $1.575 million - $2.575 million; and for a further return to be made to A and B class unit holders as envisaged in the information memorandum. Mr McNamara's evidence is that based on the current projections, A class unit holders should receive a final return of 79 per cent on their capital invested. 8 Mr McNamara's evidence is that it is not in the best interests of the unit holders that the scheme be wound up. He deposes however that if the scheme is to be wound up, that it should take place after completion of the development under the terms specified in the proposed orders so that unit holders returns are not prejudiced. FINANCING PROPOSAL 9 ASIC earlier stated to the Court that it was not prepared to agree to the proposed orders in the absence of evidence concerning the availability of finance to enable the scheme to be completed. Consequently, on 11 December 2006 the solicitors for the plaintiffs wrote to the Manager of BankWest, Balcatta Branch asking whether the Bank would, in writing, advise whether it was prepared to provide the further funding, either unconditionally or on conditions that orders in terms of the minute of proposed orders are made in the Federal Court. By letter dated 12 December 2006 the Area Manager of BankWest responded to the first plaintiff that 'based on our discussions and the information which you have provided to date (including detailed information with regard to the orders you are seeking from the Supreme Court to allow this project to proceed), BankWest is pleased to provide the attached Financing Proposal incorporating our Indicative Terms for your consideration'. The letter stated that the financing proposal was not an offer of finance, it was predicated on orders being made by the Court allowing a proposal to proceed on the basis submitted with the compliance plan being adhered to and the supervisor performing his functions as required. The letter envisaged that upon receipt of further information, the Bank would be able commence due diligence activities (which would include commissioning a valuation report and quantity engineers report) and seek formal accrediting approval. Upon completion of those steps the Bank would then be in a position to make a formal offer of finance, not necessarily in the same terms as the financial proposal. In that financial proposal as attached to the letter, there was a credit limit of $9 250 000 referred to with an unexplained additional reference in parentheses to +5 500 000. A term of 1.5 years is envisaged for the loan. ASIC'S POSITION 10 The position of ASIC is that it cannot permanently permit the undertakings envisaged in the orders to replace an application in accordance with the Act for appropriate remedies. Therefore it does not have powers to authorise the scheme. The Act provides that such schemes are to be wound up and ASIC agrees with that course. However ASIC does not consent to the proposed method of winding up or to the orders sought. It submits that the appropriate relief is to wind up the scheme now. It makes submissions in order to inform the exercise by the Court of what ASIC accepts is its discretion on the plaintiffs' proposed form of winding up. PRIOR AUTHORITIES 11 In seeking these orders the plaintiffs rely on the reasoning of White J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Mount Warren Park (Nominees) Pty Ltd (2005) 56 ACSR 43 ( Mount Warren Park 56 ACSR). There the Supreme Court of Queensland considered applications by ASIC for the winding up of four unregistered managed investment schemes. Orders were made for each of them to be completed within various periods ranging from 12 to 24 months. The orders incorporated extensive reporting requirements to investors, ASIC and the supervisor appointed to each of the schemes. At [31] White J said: 'In Tasman Investments Barrett J reviewed a great many of the authorities relating to section 601EE including a number of cases in this jurisdiction. He concluded: 'Several threads run through these cases. I would respectively adopt the observations of Mullens J in the Atlantic Three case [ASIC v Atlantic Three Financial (Aus) Pty Ltd (2003) 47 ACSR 52] that there can be a tension between what is required, as a matter of public interest, for the protection of the body of investors and what is perceived as a matter of private interest, to be in the interests of investors individually; and that is ultimately a matter of balancing all factors relevant to the particular case in determining who should be entrusted with the task of winding up the scheme and on what terms. At the same time, I remain of the general view (expressed in ASIC v Takaran (No 2) ) that the public interest dimension would cause winding up by the existing and contravening operator not to be favoured except in exceptional circumstances. ' ' 12 ASIC, in reviewing the provisions of the legislation, states it is not the case that winding up is only appropriate where the scheme is insolvent; rather winding up is the remedy for dismantling of an illegal scheme and it operates to protect as far as possible the investors recognising that their money is at risk in forms that do not comply with the requirements of the Act. 13 The submissions for ASIC refer to the reasons of Barrett J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 240 at 243-244, at [12]-[13]. There his Honour, in reference to the winding up power provided in s 601EE(2) of the Act, accepted that the powers conferred upon the Court were very broad and that 'it must be accepted that the court has jurisdiction to settle or prescribe any aspect or element of the basis for winding up or the winding up process which it is necessary to supply because that element cannot be obtained from any other source'. Further, that the statute itself does not attempt to lay down the basis for or method of winding up, so that the Court should be able to realise the assets of the scheme, discharge the liabilities and distribute any surplus among beneficiaries or members in an appropriate way as his Honour outlined. Reference is also made to the reasoning of Keane JA (with whom McMurdo P and Douglas J agreed) in Mier v FN Management Pty Ltd [2006] 1 Qd R 339 where he expressed agreement with these observations of Barrett J adding at [18] as a caveat that a court should be guided by analogies with the law relating to the winding up of companies, partnerships and trusts when deciding on the appropriate procedure for the winding up of a scheme. 14 ASIC also draws attention to the reasoning of Owen J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001) 36 ACSR 778. There, his Honour rejected an order allowing persons associated with the schemes to realise assets and distribute them among the investors. His reasons were as follows. Firstly, a receiver's report showed that some of the investors were in a questionable state and it would be better if an independent person were in control of the recovery processes. Secondly, because of intra-group transactions, it was conceivable there could be disputes concerning true ownership of some assets and the true purport of certain transactions. Thirdly, it was possible in those circumstances that investors could take different views concerning the appropriate method of finalisation. Fourthly, there was evidence of dividends having been paid to investors in returns for certain investments that were in excess of receipts in relation to those investments, so that accounting between various interests was inevitable. Fifthly, the placement of the scheme under the control of an independent external controller would remove conceptual difficulties arising if finalisation were to be effected with further breaches (albeit technical) of the law. 15 On the question of whether the circumstances under which winding up can be carried out by the operators, ASIC draws attention to the reasons of Muir J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Young [2003] QSC 29 ; (2003) 173 FLR 441 at [67] , citing from Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Koala Quality Produce Limited (2002) 41 ACSR 628 at 629. There Barrett J stated that: 'without registration and the regime it entails, necessary controls are lacking, with the result that investors are exposed to a situation in which their funds are not protected in the way the legislation intends them to be protected. This gives rise to serious public interest considerations which justify measures to put an end to the scheme. ' He concluded by stating that he could not 'think of circumstances in which the court might think it appropriate to decline to order winding up of an unregistered scheme under s 601EE, except perhaps where satisfactory remedial measures of some kind were virtually complete'. PLAINTIFFS' CONTENTIONS 16 In their submissions the plaintiffs contend that what makes it appropriate for the orders to be made in their case is that, given the volume of sales already made there will be an avoidance of a fire sale. Further, there will be a saving in costs and also there is a profit to be made upon completion of the scheme. 17 The plaintiffs also rely upon the circumstances of the meeting of investors as detailed in the first affidavit of M/s Currie. Orders proposed to have been made on 24 October 2006 provided, among other things, for the plaintiffs to arrange for a meeting of A class unit holders in the trust to consider a resolution by which the management investment scheme was to be wound up on the basis that the residential subdivision project was completed by the plaintiffs. There are 72 unit holders. A notice of meeting was dispatched to them dated 15 November 2006 together with an explanatory memorandum, a copy of legal advice, an investigative accountant's report, the minute of proposed orders and the compliance plan, being the attachment to them, a proxy form and a corporate representative form where appropriate. The meeting was called for and held on 1 December 2006. The plaintiffs received 50 valid proxy forms before the meeting and four late proxy forms. In summary, 2 570 000 valid proxy votes were received; 220 000 proxy votes were received late and 255 000 votes taken at the meeting all of which were in favour of the resolution. The total votes received represented 89.6 per cent of the total votes available. Votes were received from 61 of the 72 A class unit holders. There is, consequently, an extremely high level of support among the investors for the orders now sought. 18 ASIC submits that the views of investors are one factor to consider and do not bind the Court. It submits that the Court should take into account both those who voted for the resolution and the interests of those who did not vote. I consider this is the correct approach, although the very high level of those who did vote results in consideration of the factor being a significant one supporting the existence of exceptional circumstances in favour of the course urged by the plaintiffs. ASIC'S SUBMISSIONS 19 ASIC has given detailed consideration to the circumstances, the scheme and the proposed orders and draws attention to the following matters. Corporate entities and directors 20 The first plaintiff is owned by Mr McNamara, having two Directors, Mr McNamara and Mr Priestly ('Management'). The second plaintiff, known as 'Landbank' is owned by Property Pty Limited and Carnegie Capital Pty Limited (Carnegie Capital) having a single Director, Mr Priestly. Both of the owner companies are owned by Mr McNamara. Carnegie Capital is an underwriter to the scheme. The third plaintiff (Citibond) is also owned by Mr McNamara. Information memorandum 21 The information memorandum was distributed in about September 2005 by Citibond, Landbank and Management. It invited offers to subscribe for units in the Unit Trust to develop five properties in the Munster area by subdivision and then sale for residential use. Landbank was identified as the project developer. Management was identified as the trustee. Citibond was identified as the manager and project manager. The memorandum sought to raise $3 500 000 for A class units of $1 each in the Unit Trust. The purpose of the fundraising was to enable the purchase, subdivision and sale of the 56 residential lots. Anticipated returns of 45 --- 50 per cent over an estimated two year development period were offered. B class units were held by Citibond and Landbank who at their discretion could transfer some of their entitlements to any profits from the development. The information memorandum identified five properties said to be the subject of signed contracts which would be developed. 22 ASIC submits the scale of the scheme in terms of investors and money raised is relevant when considering the voracity of the plaintiffs' assertions as to their knowledge of the impropriety of their actions. Disclosure requirements 23 The information memorandum did not refer to the Management and Service Agreement or the managerial control given to Management or the fees and commissions Management may claim under that agreement. It also did not disclose the fees routed to Mr Priestly and Mr McNamara and the default mechanisms protecting Landbank and Citibond. The Unit Trust deed 24 ASIC submits that if the vote which was taken from unit holders at the meeting on 1 December 2006 had been to vary by termination the Unit Trust or to vary the rights of the unit holders, it would have required unanimous consent to be affective. Management and Service Agreement 25 ASIC submits that the issues raised by the investigating accountant in relation to ambiguous wording of some of the fees while being raised with management was not apparently resolved. Therefore, it is said, there is scope for some conflict between the interests of investors and the interests of management in the payment of fees arising from the development. Under the plaintiffs' proposal the future payment of expenses in the form of fees would be reported and supervised in the form proposed by them. Finance securities 26 Landbank and Management entered into a finance facility whereby Landbank borrows the money raised by Management and provides to Management a charge on its property and the land to be redeveloped. The investigating accountant has drawn attention to a lack of clarity in the accounting of this arrangement. ASIC submits the security of Management as against Landbank is a factor to be considered in the exercise of the Court's discretion on the plaintiffs' application. Money raised 27 The evidence from Mr Shadgett is that between 1 August and 14 October 2005 there were 62 offers from investors received by the plaintiffs for units in the Unit Trust. In all $2 929 000 was raised. According to the plaintiffs there are 72 investors having raised $3 399 000: see M/s Currie's first affidavit. 28 ASIC submits that the accumulation of more than 20 investors and the pooling of more that $2 million requires recommendations for the purchase of units in the Unit Trust to be accompanied by a product disclosure document in accordance with ss 1012A and 1012B of the Act and the exemption for managed investment schemes involving less than 20 investors or the accumulation of less than $2 million provided by s 1012D of the Act does not apply. ASIC submits the number of investors compared to the number required for the scheme to be registered and the amount raised compared to the amount that would require a product disclosure document is relevant in assessing the past conduct of the plaintiffs when considering their application. Investors' unit trust certificates 29 The Unit Trust balance sheet does not identify Citibond, Landbank or Management as owners of any equity. Citibond's financial statements do not record an investment in the Unit Trust. This ambiguity in the accounting information and the difficulty with the accounting records being reconciled against scheme documents is, submits ASIC, a relevant factor in considering the exercise of the discretion. Operation of the scheme 30 Again ASIC submits that the ambiguity in the scheme documents and accounting information (particularly the balance sheet, profit and loss statement and the trial balance) is a factor to be considered. Although, it accepts that the proposed orders provide for the payment of fees in the future to be reported and supervised. Scheme property acquired 31 Three of the contracts entered into by Landbank at the time of the information memorandum to acquire the scheme property required the excision of a portion of the land for retention by the vendors. The excision is identified in the information memorandum and the scheme progress was updated for investors. Progress 32 ASIC's enquiries of the City of Cockburn, where the development is located, indicate that there have been applications to subdivide and develop the scheme property in the manner proposed by the information memorandum. Physically, little has been done to the land by way of development. 33 The extent of completion is a relevant factor for consideration. ASIC submits it is apparent from cases where an operator was permitted to complete a scheme that the scheme was already finished or sufficiently near to completion that the policy concerns behind the operation of the Act were already met or redundant. Pre-sales of developed lots 34 Landbank has agreed for pre-sales in respect of 42 of the 63 lots. Some pre-sale contracts were arranged by the business Perth Landbrokers as the real estate agents and some sales were made by the parties associated with that agent. Perth Landbrokers is associated with Mr Priestly. His interest in the sale was disclosed to investors who attended the meeting of 1 December 2006. However, his interest in the real estate agent (he is registered as being the person carrying on the business), Perth Landbrokers and the interest of that firm in the settlement of three development sales was not disclosed. ASIC accepts, however, that the plaintiffs proposed that in the future the progress of sales will be supervised and reported to ASIC and investors in the manner outlined in the proposed winding up orders. Valuation 35 The valuation of the property arranged by the plaintiffs was based on the assumption that the land was to be subdivided into 69 lots for residential use. However, there will now be 63 lots. This changed circumstance was not expressly pointed out to the investors. Finance 36 BankWest has provided finance and taken registered security over the scheme property. The investigating accountant has pointed out that the primary risk to the development is obtaining further funding in the amount of $5 million from BankWest. 37 ASIC submits that for the plaintiffs to be permitted by the Court to complete the development, they should establish that the finance is available and that they can complete the development in accordance with the orders which they seek. It contends that in Mount Warren Park 56 ACSR at 49 the operators organised the finance before the orders were made. ASIC has been unable to locate any case where the Court has permitted orders as sought by the plaintiffs where the funding was not in place. It submits that if the funding was not raised there would be an immediate concern for liquidity of the scheme which would be reported in accordance with the mechanisms in the proposals before the Court. Investor correspondence 38 Documents produced by Management under notice to ASIC reveal that at least one investor was paid out his investment upon request without Management observing the terms of the Unit Trust. 39 Management has sent to investors four letters updating them on the progress of the scheme. However, it is said that they were not told of the total pre-sales, the changes to the anticipated costs of the development, the nature of the legal difficulties raised with ASIC or the absence of ASIC's assent to the proposal to restructure the scheme. It is nevertheless accepted that the proposed orders provide for more regular updates on progress costs and expenses. Nevertheless, ASIC submits the lack of frankness with which the plaintiffs have communicated with investors in the past is a matter the Court should take into account. Absence of ASIC licences or registration 40 Reference is made by ASIC to the absence of any licence to deal with financial products or the registration of the activities of the plaintiffs or the information memorandum as a managed investment scheme. However, ASIC accepts that possibly no licence will be needed as it appears the plaintiffs do not intend to issue or trade the financial products already issued. Investor protection 41 ASIC points to the existing non-compliances with the statutory requirements but accepts that the plaintiffs seek to ameliorate the position with the reporting and supervision function proposed. Meeting of investors 42 ASIC says that it consented to the interim arrangements which facilitated the meeting on 1 December 2006 but it was not fully provided with notice or copies of documents to be considered at the meeting. ASIC submits it does not consider it appropriate to include late or informal proxies in calculating the level of the consent. If those proxies are omitted there is 83 per cent consent from investors. Summary of relevant factors 43 ASIC points to the following relevant factors to the exercise of the discretion to grant the orders sought: (a) The size of the funds invested and the number of investors affected. (b) The rights of investors under scheme documents and how those rights will be affected under the proposed orders. (c) The fact that unanimous approval was not obtained. (d) The discrepancies and vagaries in the scheme documents to be administered by the plaintiffs in completion of the scheme as raised by McGrath McNichol and as yet unresolved by the plaintiffs. (e) The unresolved position of the senior finance provider BankWest in terms of its security being breached by this application and in terms of it providing a further $5 million senior debt to the scheme to enable it to be completed. (f) The progress that is required to complete the scheme and the time frame for that to happen. (g) The frankness with which the plaintiffs have dealt with the investors to date. (h) The complexity caused by having to terminate the scheme completion for what ever reason. (i) The protective mechanisms offered to investors in the proposal. (j) The seriousness of the identified contraventions. (k) The benefits of the plaintiffs completing the scheme compared to an independent administrator bringing it to an end. (l) The existence of real or possible disputes between investors and the plaintiffs in the course of the winding up which in turn depends on the reliability of the scheme documents and accounting records already in existence and to be created. (m) The depressing effect of the appointment of an external controller to the scheme including the likely expenses of such a controller. (n) The amount at stake. (o) The views of those concerned having made a financial investment. REASONING 44 There are two reasons why no final decision can be made at this time despite these extensive submissions from both parties. The first is that the submissions made by ASIC have not in terms been answered by the plaintiffs. It is necessary that they should have the opportunity to address each of the issues which ASIC suggests is adverse to the exercise of the discretion in favour of making the orders the plaintiffs seek. 45 The second is that I agree with the submission for ASIC that whether or not the plaintiffs can succeed in obtaining the orders depends quite fundamentally on whether there is finance in place which will demonstrably enable the completion of the development. In my view it is patent that that is not the present position. The letter from BankWest dated 12 December 2006 makes quite clear that the financing proposal is not an offer of finance and that steps must be taken before a formal offer of finance is made. 46 It follows that provided the issue is dealt with promptly, the Court should hold over for final consideration the application for the orders pending the final advice from BankWest and compliance by the plaintiffs with directions giving to them the opportunity of responding to adverse information supplied by ASIC. 47 The BankWest response envisaged the finalisation of Court orders should precede finalisation of finance. However, I consider that the reverse is the necessary position. I see no reason why the Bank's final position of finance cannot be determined subject to the Court making the orders, including the provisions for reporting and supervision, by the plaintiffs. 48 It was accepted on the hearing of the application that the orders should be modified to provide that no later than 9 February 2007, the applicant file and serve evidence of a grant of bank finance or the state of such financing with liberty to either party to apply. However, considering the criticality of the issue of bank finance and the fact that other adverse items have been put in the ASIC submissions (delivered on the eve of the hearing), I do not consider it would be appropriate to exercise the discretion in favour of making the orders until the outstanding matters are before the Court. 49 The plaintiffs should be constantly aware that they are now in breach of the law and that unless the circumstances are established where the Court's discretion can be exercised in favour of the orders proposed, particularly by certainty in relation to the bank finance, the Court will not countenance the continuation of the application indefinitely. 50 Accordingly the application is adjourned to enable the above matters to be attended to and appropriate directions made. I certify that the preceding fifty (50) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.

FMG is a publicly listed company on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The second defendant, Mr John Andrew Henry Forrest (Forrest) was, at all material times, FMG's chairman and chief executive officer. FMG held mining tenements in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. It planned to establish a mine there, and to construct a port at Port Hedland as well as a railway from the mine to the port in order to mine and export iron ore (the Project). In July 2004, FMG appointed Worley Pty Ltd (Worley) to manage the all-important Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS). The Project, including the mine, rail and port infrastructure, was entirely contingent upon the DFS proving to be 'bankable', that is to say sufficient to underpin the necessary finance required for the Project including the construction of the mine, railway and port. At that time it was estimated that the cost of building this infrastructure was $1.85 billion. From early in 2004, FMG and Forrest were negotiating with three Chinese building and construction companies over proposals for those companies to build the Project infrastructure. In the second half of 2004, FMG executed three framework agreements, substantially in similar terms, with China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), China Harbour Engineering Company (Group) (CHEC) and China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (CMCC) ( collectively the Chinese Contractors), concerning the construction, respectively, of the railway, port and mine. Copies of the framework agreements, named respectively the CREC Framework Agreement, the CHEC Framework Agreement and the CMCC Framework Agreement, are contained in Schedules B, C and D respectively to these reasons. These framework agreements and in particular their arguable meaning and effect are at the heart of this complex case, which concerns the provisions of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the Act) dealing with continuous disclosure (Chapter 6CA), prohibited conduct (other than insider trading prohibitions) (Chapter 7, Part 7.10) and directors' duties (Chapter 2D, Part 2D.1). FMG made notifications in August and November 2004 concerning the framework agreements to the Australian Stock Exchange Limited, as the ASX was then known, in the form of letters dated 23 August 2004, 5 November 2004 and 8 November 2004 and related media releases dated 23 August 2004 and 5 November 2004. The media release dated 23 August 2004 was incorporated by reference into the letter of 23 August 2004. The media release of 5 November 2004 was incorporated by reference into the letter of 5 November 2004. Properly understood therefore, for the purposes of s 674 of the Act there were accordingly only three notifications to the ASX. It is convenient to adopt the labels used by the plaintiff, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), in its pleading for these as follows: (1) Letter from FMG to the ASX dated 23 August 2004, 'the 23 August Letter'; and FMG media release dated 23 August 2004, 'the 23 August Media Release' (2) Letter from FMG to the ASX dated 5 November 2004, 'the 5 November Letter' and FMG media release dated 5 November 2004, 'the 5 November Media Release' (3) Letter from FMG to the ASX dated 8 November 2004, 'the 8 November Letter'. FMG made these notifications to the ASX in purported compliance with the continuous disclosure provisions under s 674 of the Act and ASX Listing Rule 3.1. Section 674(2) requires a listed disclosing entity to notify the ASX as a market operator of information that is not generally available and is information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity's securities. The notifications taken together reported, among other things, that FMG had executed binding agreements with each of CREC, CHEC and CMCC for each to build, finance and transfer the railway, port and mine respectively for the Project. In addition, over the period August 2004 to March 2005 FMG made further public statements to the same effect. I will refer to the notifications and statements collectively, whether in whole or in part as 'disclosures'. In March 2005 the framework agreements were the subject of an article in the Australian Financial Review newspaper (the AFR Article). This article contained a number of negative assertions about the Project, including that the agreements did not impose any legally binding obligations on the Chinese Contractors. This was contrary to the prior public position of the Chinese Contractors to the effect that the framework agreements bound them to construct the infrastructure. The AFR Article attracted widespread interest and further media commentary. ASIC commenced these proceedings in March 2006. The statement of claim was substituted and amended several times before and at trial, culminating in an amended statement of claim of 1 May 2009 which ASIC labels 'ASC'. I will adopt that abbreviation. ASIC's Application ASIC alleges that FMG did not have a genuine and/or reasonable basis for making these disclosures concerning the framework agreements. It alleges that FMG engaged in a course of knowing and deliberate conduct to make the disclosures, by the notifications to the ASX and other statements, which were false, unqualified and emphatic as to the significance and effect of the framework agreements. This puts in issue the alleged dishonesty of FMG, its board, and in particular, Forrest in making those disclosures. Accordingly, it says FMG contravened the continuous disclosure provisions under s 674 of the Act and engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct under s 1041H of the Act as well as under s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( TPA). I have set out, by way of introduction, the allegations made by ASIC under s 1041H in Part 9 below. ASIC says that Forrest was the architect of this course of conduct or, at the least, he was aware of it and did not prevent it, when he was evidently in a position to do so. ASIC says that, on the basis that Forrest authorised or approved the notifications to the ASX, he was involved in FMG's contraventions of s 674(2) and consequently himself contravened s 674(2A) and, in turn, s 180(1) of the Act. ASIC contends that the notifications to the ASX, which were republished by the ASX, had a positive material effect on the price of FMG's shares. ASIC does not contend that the other statements had such an effect. ASIC also contends that Forrest breached his duty as a director to exercise care and diligence as required by s 180(1) of the Act by failing to ensure that FMG both complied with its disclosure obligations and did not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct and, as a result, he exposed FMG to a risk of serious harm, including, among other things, these civil penalty proceedings. Broadly ASIC's factual contentions are as follows. In its disclosures, FMG said that the agreements with CREC, CHEC and CMCC bound each of them to build, transfer and finance the Project infrastructure. It also represented that a contract price existed, although the 8 November Letter, according to ASIC, said it was subject to an agreed confirmation process. As well, FMG represented that the agreements were in the common form of a well-known industry standard precedent for building infrastructure. ASIC says the misleading character of FMG's disclosures appears clearly from a simple comparison of these with the actual terms of the framework agreements they were purporting to describe. The core of ASIC's case under s 674 is its contention that the framework agreements did not, in their effect, oblige the Chinese Contractors to build, finance and transfer the infrastructure but at best, merely bound the parties to negotiate agreements which would have that effect, or, alternatively, were not binding at all. ASIC thus offers two alternative interpretations of the legal effect of the framework agreements. It is this \"information\" as to the asserted legal effect of each of the framework agreements which is central to what is described as the \"CREC Information\", the \"CHEC Information\" and the \"CMCC Information\" (the Informations), which ASIC pleads ought to have been disclosed, variously, between 23 August 2004 and 24 or 29 March 2005 in the case of the CMCC framework agreement and 24 or 30 March 2005 in the case of the other two framework agreements. ASIC says that FMG was obliged to disclose the Informations to the ASX under s 674(2) because that information, for the purposes of s 677, a provision which interprets s 674(2)(c)(ii) by providing for when a reasonable person would be taken to expect information to have a material effect on the price or value of an entity's securities was information which would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. ASIC pleads the alleged contraventions of s 674(2) by FMG under three categories applying to FMG's alleged failure to disclose each of the Informations. There are three contraventions alleged under each category, one in respect of each of the Informations, but ASIC only presses a total of six rather than nine contraventions of s 674(2) as the alleged contraventions under the second category are pleaded in the alternative. FMG submits, and I accept, that upon analysis, there are in substance only three possible contraventions of s 674(2), one in respect to each of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. I do not accept, as ASIC would have it, that there are 6 (or 9) possible contraventions because the alleged contraventions of s 674(2) relate to the omission to inform the market about the material terms and legal effect of the framework agreements. The three categories are as follows. First, ASIC asserts that FMG failed to disclose the Informations: ASC [136]-[140]. Second and alternatively , it is asserted that FMG's purported compliance with the requirement that it notify information to the ASX under s 674(2) and Listing Rule 3.1 was not substantially accurate; further or alternatively was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive persons who commonly invest in securities: ASC [141]-[145]. This was described in ASIC's pleading as FMG's disclosure of false information. Third and alternatively , it is asserted that FMG failed to correct these earlier false disclosures of information: ASC [146]-[153]. I agree, as FMG submits that the first and the third categories are almost identical. This is because the first complains about the omission from disclosure of the Informations and the third complains about the omission from disclosure of effectively the same information. As to the second category, ASIC's assertion is that, on their proper construction, s 674(2) and Listing Rule 3.1 forbid substantially inaccurate disclosure, or disclosure that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. FMG submits that on their proper construction, these provisions do not target such matters in that way but rather require the disclosure of omitted material. I accept this submission. Section 674(2) does not, in terms, impose an obligation upon FMG to correct information already provided to the ASX. The focus of the provision is upon the notification of information. It is a continuing obligation. This is ASIC's first category. The fact that the later provision of information may, in its effect, correct a misstatement in a notification made earlier, is merely a consequence of compliance. Accordingly, the pleaded s 674(2) claims, properly characterised, amount to a case that FMG failed or omitted to disclose the material terms and legal effect of the three framework agreements over the following periods: (1) for the CREC Framework Agreement: 23 August 2004 to 30 March 2005 (2) for the CHEC Framework Agreement: 5 November 2004 to 30 March 2005 (3) for the CMCC Framework Agreement: 5 November 2004 to 29 March 2005. There is some confusion in the pleading as ASIC also alleges that the contraventions continued up to 24 March 2005 (e.g. ASC [140]-[153]). The pleading, in effect, alleges three continuing contraventions of s 674(2) across the relevant periods, one in respect of each of the three framework agreements. The significance of the respective end dates for these periods is this. The AFR Article was published on 24 March 2005. A copy of the CMCC Framework Agreement was provided to the ASX on 29 March 2005 and copies of the other two framework agreements were provided to the ASX on 30 March 2005. Two important allegations ASIC's cases include two further important allegations - that FMG and Forrest were aware at the latest by 17 August 2004, alternatively by 5 November 2004, that: Chinese government approval would be required in order for the Chinese Contractors to finance and build the Project infrastructure; and a condition of Chinese government approval would be that a Chinese investor take some form of equity interest in the Project. The evidence demonstrates that at the relevant times various Chinese government agencies had a supervisory oversight of the overseas contracting activities of Chinese companies. These agencies are the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administrative Commission (SASAC), the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Relief ASIC seeks, under various provisions of the Act, and the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) declarations of contravention of s 674(2) and s 1041H as against FMG; and s 674(2A) and s 180 as against Forrest as well as related pecuniary penalty; and compensation orders against each of FMG and Forrest, and an order under s 206C alternatively s 206E of the Act disqualifying Forrest from managing corporations. FMG's defence FMG contends that its disclosures concerning the framework agreements were correct and that each was a binding first agreement for the construction, financing and transfer of the respective infrastructure, intended to have immediate legal effect. FMG also emphasises the importance of context, namely what was known concerning the Project by the market, when disclosures were made. In context it says the agreements were made at a time when, as the market knew, a number of matters were still in the process of development, particularly the DFS, but, despite that, they were agreements under which: (a) CREC, CHEC and CMCC agreed to build and transfer the infrastructure on the basis that FMG had to pay 10% of the value of the works before completion, such that the Chinese Contractors had agreed to take the financial risks involved in return for security over the resources; (b) the parties agreed that there would be more fulsome agreements in addition to, or in substitution for, the framework agreements but these would not detract from the binding nature of the framework agreements. As such, FMG says, it did not breach the continuous disclosure requirements of the Act and Listing Rules nor mislead the market. Further, FMG says its disclosures, to the effect that the framework agreements were binding agreements for the Chinese Contractors to build, finance and transfer the railway, port and harbour for the Project, were, in each case, an expression of opinion which was honestly and reasonably held. Accordingly, FMG says that by its notifications to the ASX on 23 August 2004 and 5 and 8 November 2004, in all of the circumstances including the market context, it did not contravene s 674(2), nor, by those notifications together with the other published statements, did it contravene s 1041H. Forrest's defence Forrest adopts FMG's submissions in addition to his own. He filed a limited defence relying on the privilege against self-incrimination and further or in the alternative the privilege against exposure to penalty. His defences were not fully advanced until he filed a lengthy outline of written submissions at the conclusion of the trial. He makes three submissions as to why he did not contravene s 674(2A) of the Act. First, FMG did not contravene s 674(2), and therefore he could not have been a person who was involved in a contravention of that subsection pursuant to sub-s (2A). Second, even if ASIC makes out its allegations pursuant to sub-s (2A) (which is denied), he did not contravene that subsection because, for the purposes of sub-s (2B), which is the due diligence defence to an allegation of a contravention of sub-s (2A), he: (1) took all steps that were reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that FMG complied with its obligations under sub-s (2); and (2) believed on reasonable grounds that FMG was complying with its obligations under that subsection. Third, he cannot be found to have contravened sub-s (2A) of the Act as the threshold element of being 'involved in' pursuant to s 79 of the Act has not been established, as he was not aware of the information ASIC says FMG was required to announce to the ASX. Forrest then says that ASIC's claim that he contravened s 180(1) of the Act is contingent upon ASIC: (1) succeeding in its claim(s) that FMG breached ss 674(2) and 1041H of the Act; and (2) proving that FMG's contraventions were serious under s 1317G(1)(b)(iii) of the Act. Further, Forrest says, if (which is denied) FMG contravened ss 674(2) and 1041H of the Act, the Court ought to find that Forrest did not contravene s 180(1) because: (1) he exercised a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the discharge of his duties; (2) at all material times, he acted honestly and reasonably believed he was acting in FMG's best interests; (3) his conduct did not expose FMG to a foreseeable risk of harm; (4) FMG has not suffered damage as a result of his conduct; and (5) FMG benefitted from his actions; or (6) the Business Judgment Rule applies. Dramatis Personae Annexed in Schedule 'A' is a dramatis personae. In order to avoid constant repetition of formalities, I have referred to persons, including the second defendant, by surname. In doing so, I do not intend to cause offence to any individual. Where I have departed from this practice by including a title and/or a first name, this has been done to avoid confusion, for example when referring to a person sharing a surname with another person, or when reference is made to Mr \"He\" of NDRC, or when the context of the reference otherwise requires it. PART 2: SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS ASIC's claims fail I have concluded that ASIC's Application should be dismissed. Under s 674(2) of the Act and Listing Rule 3.1, FMG was obliged to immediately disclose to the ASX information which a reasonable person would expect, if generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's shares. This is information that its directors or executive officers were in possession of, or ought reasonably to have come into possession of, in the performance of their duties. The information which ASIC contends ought to have been disclosed (the Informations) in this case principally comprises an assertion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. This assertion is necessarily the product of a judgment or opinion as to what is the meaning and legal effect of these agreements. There is no evidence that FMG by any of its directors or officers, including Forrest, ever held the opinions postulated by ASIC and which underpin its case as to what FMG ought to have disclosed as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. I find that the opinions contended for by ASIC do not self-evidently or obviously emerge upon merely reading the terms of the framework agreements. ASIC contends that FMG through Forrest had no genuine and or reasonable basis for making its claims that the framework agreements were binding build and transfer agreements. It has accused FMG, its board and in particular Forrest, of deliberate dishonesty in making those claims knowing that they were false, unqualified and emphatic. It says that there is no evidence that FMG obtained any legal advice concerning the agreements, and that if it had obtained competent legal advice, it would have been aware of the legal effect of the framework agreements asserted by ASIC and forming part of the Informations. It says that, in those circumstances, the misleading disclosures could not have been made by a responsible company or board of directors. This transpired to be a surprising submission for ASIC to make. In fact FMG did have the benefit of competent professional legal oversight and advice in relation to its agreements, including the framework agreements. Mr Peter Huston and his assistant Hsin-Luen Tan of Troika Legal Ltd had, prior to October 2004, been available to advise FMG. Huston was described by ASIC in its pleading as a qualified, experienced and practising commercial solicitor. From early October 2004, Huston and Tan joined FMG as employees. It is apparent that one of Huston's principal roles, at least from that time, was to oversee and ensure the legal enforceability, or as Forrest sometimes said, the \"bankability\" of FMG's agreements. This is evident from an email dated 3 October 2004 sent by Forrest to FMG's senior executives and Graeme Rowley, another of FMG's directors. Forrest had known Huston for a number of years prior to this. Huston acted as solicitor for Anaconda Nickel Ltd in proceedings in the Supreme Court of Western Australia culminating in an appeal to the Full Court: Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101. These proceedings concerned the enforceability of a short letter said to be a \"heads of agreement\". In certain respects it bears a remarkable similarity to the framework agreements. The majority (Ipp J; Pidgeon J agreeing) held that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding agreement. Huston helped prepare the draft as well as the final 8 November Letter concerning the three framework agreements provided by FMG to the ASX that day. He attended a meeting with Mr Tony Walsh, Assistant Manager Issuers of the ASX, on 8 November 2004 relevantly to discuss this draft for the purpose of providing further information to the ASX as to the terms of the framework agreements. I have concluded that, for this purpose, Huston would have considered the terms of the related 5 November Letter and the three framework agreements referred to in that letter. He did not advise the FMG Board or Forrest that these agreements were not legally binding or that the 5 November Letter was to that extent incorrect or not reasonably based. Given his role in FMG, had he formed that view, I find that he should have and would have informed the board. That he did not, entitled the board and Forrest to continue to regard the disclosures concerning the legal effect of the framework agreements as correct, or at least that they were reasonably based. That this was so is fortified by evidence of actual advice given by Huston to the FMG board that the framework agreements were legally binding as disclosed. The FMG board minutes of its 22 January 2005 meeting, attended by Huston, record his advice to the board that the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding. So too did an email sent by him on 30 March 2005 to Forrest, Christopher Catlow, David Liu, Rowley, Alan Watling and other FMG executives concerning the AFR Article in which he repeated this advice, relying in particular upon the Anaconda decision. The 30 March 2005 email was not disclosed in ASIC's pleading. While the minutes of the 22 January board meeting were set out as a particular of two allegations concerning FMG's and Forrest's knowledge of the Chinese Contractors' attitude towards the framework agreements and of the legal effect of the agreements, ASIC did not particularise the material passage in the minutes where Huston's legal advice to the board was set out, nor did it refer to this passage in its opening or closing submissions. This is so, despite the fact that, in relation to ASIC's s 674 case, it asserted, amongst other things, that FMG ought to have been aware of the legal effect of the framework agreements asserted by ASIC by first obtaining competent legal advice. Huston was a very experienced and competent commercial solicitor. I was not referred to these documents during the trial until the closing address by Forrest's senior counsel, Mr Myers QC. Their content, combined with other evidence, demonstrates that there was no basis for ASIC to assert dishonesty on the part of FMG, its board and in particular, Forrest. I make the same criticism of the description applied to FMG and by implication its board and particularly Forrest in the way ASIC's case was opened. It was asserted that FMG engaged in a concerted and designed course of conduct in which it made false, misleading and exaggerated statements to the ASX of which Forrest was the architect. In my view the evidence does not support such serious allegations. The principal basis, it seems, depends on ASIC's submission that the framework agreements are self-evidently not binding build and transfer agreements. I rejected that argument. I consider that there was a reasonable basis for FMG, through its board, including Forrest, to have held the view that the framework agreements were binding as claimed. It was supported by Huston's professional oversight to ensure the legal enforceability of FMG's agreements as well as his later positive advice to the effect that they were such. It was a view consistent with Forrest's knowledge of the Anaconda case. It finds arguable support in other authority. Significantly too, CREC approved the terms of the 23 August Media Release before FMG made the notifications to the ASX on 23 August 2004. The release described the CREC Framework Agreement as a \"binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd's $1.85 billion Pilbara iron ore project\". In the release Mr Qin Jiaming (Qin), the President of CREC, is quoted as saying that the contract presented an excellent opportunity for CREC to develop internationally and that CREC was fully confident about its capacity to build the rail project. It was described by him as a 'marriage' immediately following the high level ceremony when the parties signed the Joint Statement which rendered the agreement binding. I find that the terms of the 5 November Media Release provided to CHEC and CMCC was likewise approved, at least not disavowed, by them before disclosure to the ASX by FMG. The AFR Article, which reported that, according to the Chinese parties, the framework agreements did not impose on them legally binding obligations, was engineered by Mr He of the NDRC as a blunt commercial tactic in an attempt to wrest majority control of the Project from FMG. This was quite contrary to the clear understanding which existed prior to the execution of the framework agreements that FMG would never agree to this but that a minority equity position would be given to a Chinese entity. I find FMG was entitled to regard Mr He's unwarranted actions, which resulted in publication of the AFR Article, as a plank in his attempt to renegotiate the equity question. FMG was ultimately successful in reducing the demands from a majority to a minority equity position. The AFR Article did not reflect the actual views of the Chinese Contractors who, on the evidence, prior to and after its publication, regarded themselves bound by the framework agreements to build the infrastructure. I have had no hesitation in finding that FMG, its board and Forrest held their opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements honestly and reasonably. FMG submits that the framework agreements actually do have the legal effect claimed in its disclosures. It is unnecessary for me to reach a concluded view as to that. I have concluded that FMG's and Forrest's opinion, which underpinned the disclosures, in each case was honestly and reasonably held at the times of the disclosures and thereafter. This is sufficient for present purposes. Accordingly, they were not in possession of, nor ought reasonably have been in possession of, the Informations, which include ASIC's opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the respective framework agreements. ASIC's case under s 674(2) against FMG fails for this reason alone. As a consequence of my finding that FMG did not contravene s 674(2), Forrest could not have been a person who was involved in a contravention of that subsection pursuant to sub-s (2A). For the sake of completeness, although finding that ASIC's case under s 674 fails at this threshold, I have considered the further issue of materiality, assuming, contrary to my finding, that the Informations constituted, respectively, information which, in each case, was or ought to have been in the possession of FMG's directors and, accordingly, was information of which FMG was aware. By materiality I refer to the question whether the Informations constituted information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. This is a question which may be approached on an ex ante or an ex post basis. ASIC and FMG each called expert witnesses to give evidence on the question of materiality. ASIC's expert witnesses were Mr Andrew Sisson, Mr Reginald Keene and Dr Iain Watson. FMG's expert witness was Mr Gregory Houston. Given the view I have come to about the materiality of the Informations, if my conclusion that FMG was not aware of this information for the purposes of Listing Rules 3.1 and 19.12 and s 674(2) of the Act is wrong, and the correct position is that FMG was or became aware of the legal effect of the framework agreements contended for by ASIC, beginning with knowledge of the legal effect of the CREC Framework Agreement on 23 August 2004, then I find that FMG was obliged to disclose the CREC Information not from 23 August 2004 but from 5 November 2004 when the notifications in respect of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements were also made. That is because the CREC Information during the period 23 August to 5 November, in my view, was not information which would have or would be likely to have influenced common investors in the way provided for in s 677. The position is different from 9 November, in light of the actual notifications made, when in my view the release of the Informations would have had or would be likely to have had the relevant influence on common investors. I have found that FMG did not contravene s 1041H of the Act. The disclosures complained of by ASIC did not constitute misleading or deceptive conduct. FMG's disclosures concerning the binding nature of the framework agreements were assertions, necessarily underpinned by an opinion that the agreements were such. In my view, such an opinion was reasonably based and honestly held by FMG and Forrest. The expression, in effect, of that opinion, by its assertions as to the effect of the framework agreements misrepresented nothing. That there was scope for alternative opinions to be held as to the legal effect of the framework agreements does not mean that FMG engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct. The gravamen of ASIC'S additional or alternative case under s 1041H is that FMG's disclosures as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements were misleading or deceptive or likely to be so in circumstances where FMG did not have a genuine and/or reasonable basis for making the statements and ought reasonably to have known that the Chinese Contractors would not or probably would not carry out the works necessary for the Project without the approval of NDRC. ASIC then says that the NDRC would, or probably would, withhold its approval for CREC, CHEC or CMCC to enter contracts binding them to build, finance and transfer the infrastructure necessary for the Project unless a Chinese entity obtained an equity interest in the Project. I find that FMG and Forrest knew that financial investment by the Chinese Contractors in building the infrastructure required NDRC approval and that Mr He of the NDRC in turn tied that approval to the requirement that a Chinese entity, likely ultimately to have been CMCC, obtain a minority equity in, it seems, an FMG mine(s). However, I find that the NDRC and probably also by the MOC had approved the Chinese Contractors entering into the framework agreements. I have concluded that FMG's disclosures were not misleading or deceptive. The additional allegations, concerning NDRC approval and equity do not alter my conclusion. In any event, although I have found that Chinese commercial reality dictated NDRC approval as a prerequisite to the provision of finance, this does not mean that the need for approval operated at a contractual level. Neither NDRC approval nor the provision of equity was a condition of the framework agreements, nor was it contained in the drafts of later documents known as Advanced Framework Agreement although they could have been. ASIC's primary claim is that the disclosures made as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements were misleading or deceptive. The need for approval tied to equity does not, in my opinion, at least in the way ASIC pleaded its case, impact upon that question. I find that, in respect of the CREC Framework Agreement, the trigger for NDRC approval for financial investment, being the provision of a minority equity interest to a Chinese entity, whether by shareholding or joint venture, was almost a formality. FMG had, for a long time prior to execution of the CREC Framework Agreement, been pursuing such Chinese investment, and more, and the Chinese side was anxious to obtain it. The NDRC had given every indication that it fully supported the Project and was keen for Chinese involvement. FMG had over a long period made it clear it was prepared to give a Chinese contractor or steel mill a minority equity stake. Mr He, of the NDRC, in August 2004 also made it clear that this was all that was being sought. It was, as at 5 November 2004, when the last two framework agreements had been executed and when disclosures were made on 9 November 2004, then only a matter of negotiating the actual amount of the equity interest and its price. There was not even the hint of a suggestion that this could not or would not be achieved. Indeed the position, as at 9 November was to the contrary. In other words, FMG and Forrest, quite reasonably, considered that the matter of NDRC approval for financial investment and the allied question of the provision of equity was no barrier to the performance of the executed framework agreements. ASIC's case concerned statements about the legal effect of the framework agreements, not that there was a practical barrier to their performance. The market was already aware that significant aspects of the framework agreements still had to be agreed upon through the DFS process and that, in any event, each of the framework agreements was ultimately dependent on a bankable DFS at the earliest in March 2005. Approval by the NDRC, linked as it was to the provision of equity, was merely another contingency. This does not go to the issue of their legal effect. The grant, in due course, of NDRC approval was regarded, reasonably, by FMG, as a formality. That, from November 2004, this was complicated by the marked and unwarranted change of position taken by Mr He of the NDRC merely gave rise to negotiations as, indeed, Mr He intended. FMG and Forrest were entitled, in my view, to negotiate with the Chinese Contractors through CMCC and the NDRC to resolve the impasse created by Mr He, contrary as it was to the consensus reached in August 2004 for minority equity, without having to inform the ASX. Indeed, by September 2005, FMG had succeeded in reducing the demands for majority equity down to a 50/50 joint venture although that process took many months However the DFS completion date had been extended beyond March 2005 and was only partially completed in September 2005 and not fully completed till April the following year. There was no question, as the market well knew, that any of the framework agreements would proceed until there was a completed bankable DFS. As ASIC's cases under s 674(2) and s 1041H fail it follows that its cases against Forrest in respect of accessorial liability under s 674(2A) for the alleged contraventions of the continuous disclosure provisions by FMG and for the alleged breach of directors' duties under s 180(1) must also fail. Postscript Allegations of dishonesty made by ASIC against directors, in legal proceedings, are self evidently serious. They carry considerable weight and will often, as in this case, attract wide media coverage. That they are made by the corporate regulator may injure the business of the particular company and will tend to adversely affect the reputations of those against whom the allegations are made. Unless the allegations are withdrawn the director(s) accused have to wait until trial before these can be tested. Meanwhile they have to live and work in their shadow. In this case the proceedings have been on foot for more than three years. For at least these reasons, it is important that allegations of dishonesty should be made only where there is a reasonable evidentiary basis for them. It is my opinion that on the totality of the evidence available to ASIC there was no such basis in this case. Notwithstanding that ASIC's assertions as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements differs from that disclosed by FMG to the knowledge of Forrest, this difference, which, in effect, is a difference of opinion does not of itself provide a basis for alleging dishonesty against FMG, its board and in particular Forrest. FMG's opinion was underpinned by the oversight and advice of its in-house counsel Huston. Forrest had his knowledge and experience in Anaconda to draw upon . Documents demonstrating these significant matters were available to ASIC. In light of these it is difficult to discern why ASIC ran a case alleging that FMG's board could not have made the disclosures it did if it had obtained competent legal advice. The board of FMG had no reason to doubt the correctness of Huston's view as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. He was employed by FMG primarily to ensure that all of FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. The reasonableness of FMG's opinion was strongly contended for by senior counsel for both FMG and Forrest at trial. It was an opinion which I consider was reasonably open. In my view, these allegations of dishonesty should not have been made. I have no hesitation in concluding that FMG and its board, including Forrest, honestly and reasonably held the opinion that the framework agreements were legally enforceable in the sense asserted in FMG's disclosures. They did not hold the opinions propounded by ASIC. Those opinions do not self evidently and obviously arise upon a consideration of the terms of the framework agreements. PART 3: EVIDENTIARY MATTERS Standard of proof Forrest submits that one important aspect of this matter is the application of the principles found in Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336 to himself. He points to the seriousness of the allegations made by ASIC and the severity of the penalties it seeks in the form of large financial penalties and his disqualification from managing a corporation. He submits that these are more severe than many criminal punishments and would cause enormous harm to him and FMG. He says that, in these circumstances, the level of satisfaction that the Court requires to reach before accepting any of ASIC's contentions is as close to the criminal standard as could be in any civil proceeding. FMG also cited Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; 60 CLR 336 , saying that, because these are civil penalty proceedings, the Court should not lightly make findings of contraventions, even applying the balance of probabilities standard, given the seriousness of the causes of action and the gravity of the matters alleged and their consequences. FMG and Forrest are relying on the principle emerging from Dixon J's judgment in Briginshaw 60 CLR at 361-362 that in considering whether an allegation is made out to its \"reasonable satisfaction\", a tribunal should take into account the seriousness of the allegation and the gravity of the consequences that would follow if the allegation were to be accepted. In Qantas Airways Limited v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 ; (2008) 167 FCR 537 , French and Jacobson JJ stated at [110] that the \"so-called Briginshaw test\" does not create any third standard of proof between the civil and the criminal. Their Honours said the standard of proof remains the same, that is proof on the balance of probabilities, and that the degree of satisfaction that is required in determining that that standard has been discharged may vary according to the seriousness of the allegations of misconduct that are made. Pursuant to s 1332 of the Act, the standard of proof in these civil penalty proceedings is the civil standard. Section 1317L of the Act requires the Court to apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order. Section 140(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) (the Evidence Act ) prescribes the standard of proof in a civil proceeding as the balance of probabilities, and s 140(2) provides that the Court may take into account, in deciding whether it is so satisfied, the nature of the cause of action or defence, the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged. In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing & Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 the Full Court noted at [31] that Dixon J's classic discussion in Briginshaw appositely expresses the considerations which s 140(2) of the Evidence Act now requires a court to take into account. Section 1332 of the Act differs from s 140 of the Evidence Act in that it does not contain the 'Briginshaw' considerations found in s 140(2) of the Evidence Act . However this does not require s 140(2) of the Evidence Act to be read down. In any event given that s 1317L requires the Court to apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order, the considerations expressed in Dixon J's Briginshaw discussion are nevertheless relevant. In Neat Holdings Pty Ltd v Karajan Holdings Pty Ltd [1992] HCA 66 ; (1992) 110 ALR 449 at 449-450 Mason CJ, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ referred to Dixon J's considerations in Briginshaw and said: The ordinary standard of proof required of a party who bears the onus in civil litigation in this country is proof on the balance of probabilities. That remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud . On the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what it is sought to prove. Thus, authoritative statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary 'where so serious a matter as fraud is to be found'. Statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof. Rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not lightly make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct. (Emphasis added. Citations omitted) These are civil penalty proceedings, not criminal proceedings, and it would be contrary to the legislative intention underlying the civil penalty provisions to apply a de facto criminal standard of proof in such proceedings: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2009] NSWSC 1229 at [408]. In conclusion, the standard of proof that I must apply is the balance of probabilities as prescribed by s 1332, and I accept that in deciding whether ASIC's allegations are made out on the balance of probabilities I am required to take into account the causes of action and the gravity of the matters alleged and their consequences: s 140(2) Evidence Act ; Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; 60 CLR 336. If inferences are to be drawn, ASIC has to establish that the circumstances appearing from the evidence give rise to a reasonable and definite inference and not merely to conflicting inferences of equal degrees of probability: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; (2009) 256 ALR 199 at [186] ; Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; 162 FCR 466 at [38] . ASIC's case is that the conduct of FMG and Forrest between August 2004 and March 2005 was an affront to the policy considerations that underpin ss 674 and 1041H of the Act and amounted to very serious contraventions of those important provisions. ASIC also submits that Forrest failed to exercise his powers and discharge his duties with the degree of care and diligence required of him under s 180 of the Act. It says that each contravention of s 674(2) by FMG and of s 674(2A) and of s 180(1) by Forrest materially prejudiced the interests of members of FMG, further or alternatively was serious, for the purposes of sub-s 1317G(1) and 1317G(1)(1A) of the Act. Accordingly, I accept that ASIC's allegations against FMG and Forrest are serious. In addition, I accept that the penalties sought against both would have severe consequences. Any monetary penalties against FMG and Forrest would likely have been very substantial. Section 1317(G)(1) allows the court to impose a pecuniary penalty of up to $200,000 for each contravention of s 180(1). ASIC alleges a total of 22 contraventions of that subsection by Forrest, ASC [177]. ASIC sought orders for Forrest to compensate FMG for the full amount of any damage which FMG suffered by reason of being liable to pay a pecuniary penalty for each contravention of s 674(2). The relevant maximum penalty for each contravention by FMG is $1 million. ASIC also sought orders for Forrest to be disqualified from managing corporations. Jones v Dunkel FMG foreshadowed that it would call evidence from its executives, such as Rowley, David Liu and Alan Watling but it did not do so. ASIC submits that, where an inference is open from facts proved, the unexplained failure of a party to call a witness or tender a document may be taken into account as a circumstance in favour of the drawing inference: Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298 at 308, 312 and 320-321; RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3 ; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [26] . ASIC submits that it should be inferred that Rowley, Liu and Watling were available to be called, but FMG chose not to call them for strategic reasons. As a result, ASIC says, if there are inferences to be drawn from documents in evidence, which could have been explained by these executives, or by Forrest who also elected not to give evidence, the inference should be drawn against FMG that the evidence of these executives would have been of no assistance to their case, and that the documents should bear the meaning contended for by ASIC. FMG made no submissions on whether Jones v Dunkel had any application. Citing Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45 ; (2002) 210 CLR 285 , Forrest submitted in written closing submissions that a Jones v Dunkel inference may not be drawn against an accused in a criminal case because the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel is incompatible with the presumption of innocence and the rights of the accused; further, this reasoning applies with equal force to the accused calling other persons to give evidence. Forrest then submitted that the point of principle that, when an accused exercises the right not to give evidence the jury is directed that no adverse inference should be drawn, applies to a civil proceeding as against an individual defendant. He referred to the statement of Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, and Heydon JJ in Rich v Australian Securities and Investment Commission [2004] HCA 42 ; (2004) 220 CLR 129 at [24] that the privilege against exposure to penalty serves the purpose of ensuring that those who allege criminality or other (illegal) conduct should prove it, and said there is no expectation that a defendant will give evidence on matters for which the plaintiff bears the onus of proof. He said there is no authority that supports the proposition that a Jones v Dunkel inference is available against an individual defendant in a civil penalty proceeding, though, he said, the position may be different for a company. Finally, Forrest submitted that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel ; and a Jones v Dunkel inference is not be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents, citing Singh v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 389 ; (2001) 109 FCR 152 at [71] . In RPS [2000] HCA 3 ; 199 CLR 620 , Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25 ; (2001) 205 CLR 50 and Dyers [2002] HCA 45 ; 210 CLR 285 , the High Court considered the applicability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel to criminal proceedings. It decided that the rule is of very limited application to defendants in criminal cases, its reasoning based on the accusatorial nature of criminal proceedings. As an illustration of the Court's approach, in Dyers , Gaudron and Hayne JJ stated at [9]: As was pointed out in RPS... , it will seldom, if ever, be reasonable to conclude that an accused in a criminal trial would be expected to give evidence. Not only is the accused not bound to give evidence, it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The mode of reasoning which is spoken of in ... Jones v Dunkel (26) ordinarily, therefore, cannot be applied to a defendant in a criminal trial. That mode of reasoning depends upon a premise that the person concerned not only could shed light on the subject but also would ordinarily be expected to do so. The conclusion that an accused could shed light on the subject-matter of the charge is a conclusion that would ordinarily be reached very easily. But given the accusatorial nature of a criminal trial, it cannot be said that, in such a proceeding, the accused would ordinarily be expected to give evidence. So to hold would be to deny that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. That is why the majority of the Court concluded, in RPS and in Azzopardi , that it is ordinarily inappropriate to tell the jury that some inference can be drawn from the fact that the accused has not given evidence. In Azzopardi [2001] HCA 25 ; 205 CLR 50 , in their joint majority judgment Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ referred to Weissensteiner v The Queen [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217 where the High Court held it was appropriate for the trial judge to direct the jury as to the manner in which they might take into account the failure of the accused to give evidence, and their Honours stated at [61] that what was important in Weissensteiner and what warranted the remarks to the jury in that case was that, if there were facts which explained or contradicted the evidence against the accused, they were facts which were within the knowledge only of the accused, and thus could not be the subject of evidence from any other person or source. At [68], their Honours emphasised that cases in which a judge may comment on the failure of an accused to offer an explanation will be both rare and exceptional and will occur only if the evidence is capable of explanation by disclosure of additional facts known only to the accused. Their Honours said a comment will never be warranted merely because the accused has failed to contradict some aspect of the prosecution case. In RPS [2000] HCA 3 ; 199 CLR 620 , at [26]-[27] Gaudron A-CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ contrasted the reasonable expectation that a party in a civil trial would give or call relevant evidence in the circumstances described in Jones v Dunkel with the conclusion that it would seldom, if ever, be reasonable to expect an accused in a criminal trial to give evidence. Weissensteiner provides an example of where the latter would be reasonable. Turning to the civil penalty authorities, in Rich , the High Court reversed a decision of the New South Wales Court of Appeal ( Rich v Australian Securities & Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 342 ; (2003) 203 ALR 671) that the defendants in civil penalty proceedings brought by ASIC were not permitted to resist an order for discovery made by the trial judge by claiming the privilege against self-exposure to penalty. The orders sought by ASIC included disqualification orders but not pecuniary penalties. The trial judge, Austin J, did not classify the proceedings as proceedings for the imposition of a penalty: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich (No 3) [2003] NSWSC 328 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 920 , at [53]. the Court of Appeal (Spigelman CJ, with whom Ipp JA agreed; McColl JA dissenting) upheld Austin J's ruling, identifying a disqualification order as having an exclusively protective purpose and stating that it should not be characterized as a penalty for the purposes of the penalty privilege. However, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ, Kirby J dissenting) decided that the disqualification order was a penalty and accordingly the proper course was to refuse any order for discovery: per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ at [37]-[40]. The ruling was made in the joint judgment in consideration of s 1317L of the Act which requires the application of the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order. Their honours concluded at [19] that that the statute itself requires the application of the body of law which has developed in relation to the privileges against penalties and forfeitures when deciding whether an order for discovery should be made. The Rich cases therefore turned on the issue of whether a disqualification order was a penalty. It was not in dispute that the privilege against exposure to penalty protected a defendant in civil proceedings not only from being obliged to give discovery, but also from being subject to any direction that affidavits or witness statements be provided to the plaintiff prior to the hearing or at any time prior to the conclusion of the plaintiff's case: see e.g. Austin J at first instance: [2003] NSWSC 328 ; (2003) 21 ACLC 920 , at [19]-[30]. In their judgments, neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal considered the application of the rule in Jones v Dunkel ; Austin J mentioned it briefly in passing at [58]. The rule in Jones v Dunkel was discussed however in Adler v Australian Securities & Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 179 FLR 1 , Williams v Australian Securities & Investments Commission [2003] NSWCA 131 ; (2003) 46 ACSR 504 , a judgment handed down before the High Court's Rich ruling, where the New South Wales Court of Appeal ruled that the trial judge, Santow J ((2002) [2002] NSWSC 171 ; 41 ACSR 72) , made no error in so far as his findings against Mr Adler, his company and Mr Williams were aided by Jones v Dunkel inferences against both those individuals and the company. In that proceeding ASIC had sought, inter alia , disqualification orders as well as pecuniary penalties. Giles JA, with whom Mason P and Beazley JA agreed, considered the High Court criminal cases discussed above and noted at [658] that proceedings for civil penalties do not share the same fundamental features of a criminal trial. His Honour stated that civil penalty proceedings are expressly to be maintained by civil law processes, not by a criminal trial with its fundamental features, [659]. He concluded that it was open for Jones v Dunkel inferences to be drawn against Mr Adler, his company, and Mr Williams in the proceedings, [661]. In relation to a submission that rules akin to prosecutorial fairness that apply in criminal proceedings should apply to civil penalty proceedings, Giles JA stated that by declaring that the proceedings were to be conducted as civil proceedings, the legislature has plainly declined to pick up the concepts that have developed in the particular circumstances of criminal proceedings such as prosecutorial fairness, [672]-[678]. The rulings in Adler were therefore made on the footing that the privilege against exposure to penalty was attracted through ASIC's seeking of pecuniary penalties, but this did not prevent the trial judge from applying the rule in Jones v Dunkel, the rule and privilege both falling within the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters that the court was bound to apply pursuant to s 1317L of the act when hearing proceedings for a declaration of contravention or a pecuniary penalty order. The High Court refused an application for special leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal's decision in Adler : [2004] HCATrans 182 , 28 May 2004. The transcript reveals that the special leave point argued was the issue of procedural fairness in dealing with the imposition of pecuniary penalties and disqualification under the civil penalties regime of the Act; there was no discussion of the rule in Jones v Dunkel . Further, in my view, nothing that has been said by the High Court in Dyers [2002] HCA 45 ; 210 CLR 285 and the other authorities discussed above supports the proposition that the general rule proscribing the making of inferences from a defendant's failure to give evidence in criminal proceedings should be extended to civil penalty proceedings in the form of a prohibition against applying the rule in Jones v Dunkel , notwithstanding that pursuant to Rich s 1317L also obliges the court to apply the body of law which has developed in relation to the privileges against penalties and forfeitures when deciding whether an order for discovery should be made. Further authority for the availability of the rule in Jones v Dunkel in civil penalty proceedings is found in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd (2001) 115 FCR 442 , where Hill J stated at [33]: Where the proceedings are criminal (and the present proceedings are not; they are proceedings, inter alia, for the recovery of a civil penalty) it might be thought that the failure of the accused to go into evidence should not lead to the drawing of Jones v Dunkel inferences. After all it is clear that a witness can not be compelled to give evidence which is likely to incriminate the witness or expose the witness to a penalty. However, even in criminal cases it has been held that the failure of the accused, who is in a position to deny, explain or answer the evidence adduced by the prosecution, to give evidence will permit the jury to draw inferences adverse to the accused more readily: see Azzopardi v R [2001] HCA 25 ; (2001) 179 ALR 349 , affirming Weissensteiner v R [1993] HCA 65 ; (1993) 178 CLR 217. A fortiori, therefore, the failure of a respondent to proceedings for recovery of a pecuniary penalty to give evidence on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding and deny, explain or answer the evidence adduced against the respondent will permit the Court more readily to draw the inferences to which the decision in Jones v Dunkel refers. In Council of the New South Wales Bar Association v Power [2008] NSWCA 135 ; (2008) 71 NSWLR 451 at [21] , a proceeding seeking removal of a legal practitioner from the Roll, Hodgson JA, with whom Beazley and McColl JJA agreed, referred to the High Court's conclusion in Azzopardi [2001] HCA 25 ; 205 CLR 50 that it was open to a trial judge in a criminal case to make a comment relating to the absence of evidence of additional facts peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. Hodgson JA went on to say at [22] concerning the case before him that: If this had been a criminal trial, then in my opinion what the High Court said in Azzopardi would have meant that a jury could have been told that inferences from proved facts could more safely be drawn because the opponent elected not to give any explanation in terms of additional facts peculiarly within his knowledge or any evidence of such facts. In my opinion, if such Jones v Dunkel reasoning is available to a jury in a criminal trial, it must a fortiori be available to a court in civil proceedings such as the present. That would be so, even if these civil proceedings are regarded as proceedings for a civil penalty. I note that a similar view was expressed by Hill J in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Universal Music Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1800 ; (2001) 201 ALR 502 at [33] . In Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2007] FCAFC 132 ; (2007) 162 FCR 466 , the Court discussed the Adler and Rich cases and concluded at [76] that there is no reason in civil proceedings for pecuniary penalties to deny the applicability of the principles in Jones v Dunkel provided that in doing so the court proceeds in accordance with the principles in relation to s 140 of the Evidence Act , which prescribes he civil standard as the applicable standard of proof. I have discussed the standard of proof earlier. Finally, in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Rich [2009] NSWSC 1229, Austin J concluded at [458] that, having considered the reasoning in Dyers and Adler , the principle in Jones v Dunkel is applicable against either party to civil penalty proceedings. ASIC seeks to draw Jones v Dunkel inferences against FMG by reason of the failure of Forrest and the other executives to give evidence. ASIC does not seek to draw the inferences against Forrest himself. Forrest has relied on the privilege against self-incrimination and the privilege against exposure to penalty, privileges which are are not available to corporations: Trade Practices Commission v Abbco Ice Works Pty Ltd [1994] FCA 1279 ; (1994) 52 FCR 96. However, even if ASIC had sought to draw inferences against Forrest as well as the corporate entity, on my review of the authorities it would not have been precluded from doing so. There is no reason therefore, in these circumstances, why the inferences cannot, as a matter of law, be drawn against FMG in the present proceedings. The question which then arises is whether I should draw such an inference in the manner urged by ASIC The authorities state that two inferences are involved in the rule in Jones v Dunkel . First, a court might infer that the evidence of the absent witness would not have assisted the party that failed to call that witness; secondly, a court might draw, with greater confidence, any inference unfavourable to the party that failed to call that witness, if that witness appears to be in a position to cast light on whether the inference should be drawn: Manly Council v Byrne and Anor [2004] NSWCA 123 at [51] ; ASIC v Macdonald [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199 per Gzell J at [1137]. In Manly Council , the Court of Appeal stated that there is no compulsion on the trial judge to draw either of the Jones v Dunkel inferences. This was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Howell v Macquarie University [2008] NSWCA 26 at [97] - [98], where Campbell JA said, with the agreement of Spigelman CJ and Bell JA (as her Honour then was): In other words, in a civil trial by judge alone Jones v Dunkel licences, but does not compel, the drawing of inferences when a witness is not called. Whether either or both of the inferences are actually drawn is part of the trial judge's task of weighing the evidence. Further, the Court of Appeal in Manly Council referred to the principles concerning the application of Jones v Dunkel set out by Glass JA in Payne v Parker [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 at 201-202 which have been widely regarded as correct although Glass JA was in dissent as to the application of the principles to the facts: per Campbell JA with whom Beazley JA and Pearlman AJA agreed, at [53]. In Payne [1976] 1 NSWLR 191 , Glass JA said that whether Jones v Dunkel should be applied depends on establishing three conditions: (a) the missing witness would be expected to be called by one party rather than the other, (b) his evidence would elucidate a particular matter, (c) his absence is unexplained. Glass JA elaborated on condition (b), saying (omitting authorities): According to Wigmore, par. 285, the second condition is fulfilled where the party or his opponent claims that the facts would thereby be elucidated. Under other formulations, the condition is made out when the witness is presumably able to put a true complexion on the facts..., might have proved the contrary...; would have a close knowledge of the facts..., or where it appears that he had knowledge.... I would think it in-sufficient to meet the requirements of principle that one party merely claims that the missing witness has knowledge, or that, upon the evidence, he may have knowledge. Unless, upon the evidence, the tribunal of fact is entitled to conclude that he probably would have knowledge, there would seem to be no basis for any adverse deduction from the failure to call him. Before stating my conclusion on whether I ought to make any Jones v Dunkel inferences, I will deal with the final authority cited by Forrest, Singh v Minister for Immigration [2001] FCA 389 ; (2001) 109 FCR 152 , from which he submits the following propositions emerge: that inferences are to be drawn from the documents before considering any question of Jones v Dunkel ; and that a Jones v Dunkel inference is not to be used in determining what inference ought to be drawn from the documents. In Singh , the applicant sought judicial review of a Ministerial decision to refuse to grant a spouse visa on character grounds. The Minister's reasons for decision were given in two documents: a decision record and a statement of reasons. The applicant argued that the Minister erred in making his decision by failing to have regard to the character references in support of the applicant which were annexed to a letter attached to the decision record. The Minister did not give evidence at trial, but Sackville J found that the statement of reasons provided affirmative evidence that the Minister gave consideration to the contents of the character references. The inferences that the applicant sought to draw by the Minister's failure to give evidence were contradicted by the Minister's statement of reasons. In my view, what Sackville J said in Singh concerning the application of the Jones v Dunkel principle to the case before him is merely an application of the second condition given by Glass JA in Payne at p 201 as to whether the principle can or should be applied, namely whether the evidence of the missing witness would elucidate a particular matter. There was no occasion to draw an inference from the Minister's failure to give evidence because in his Honour's view, the question of whether he took into account the character references was adequately addressed by the statement of reasons. As ASIC's senior counsel put it, in ASIC's closing written submissions, generally, the evidence upon which ASIC relies to establish all of the alleged contraventions is documentary, and founded upon FMG's own business records. This evidence is supplemented by certain alleged admissions by Watling and Rowley, derived from transcripts of examinations conducted by ASIC pursuant to s 19 of the ASIC Act : ASIC's closing submissions [47]-[48]. ASIC withdrew from tender alleged admissions made by Forrest during his s 19 examination. This was so despite the fact that Forrest who had not claimed privilege, as he might have done during his examination sought to have additional parts of his transcript admitted which he said would put in context and explained what ASIC contended amounted to admissions against Forrest's interest. The additional evidence, I infer, would have been favourable to Forrest. If ASIC considered that, despite this additional evidence, the transcript nonetheless disclosed relevant admissions then it would, no doubt, have persisted with its tender. However, I was denied the benefit of any of this evidence. ASIC has not identified any particular matters that the evidence of the executives, including Forrest, would elucidate. For these reasons, I decline to make any Jones v Dunkel inference against FMG from the failure of Forrest and the other executives to give evidence. Browne v Dunn ASIC submits there is also a small amount of direct evidence from witnesses it called which mostly went unchallenged. For example, Catherine Li, a former FMG engineer, was not cross-examined about her evidence concerning a meeting on 6 November in which Forrest offered a 30% equity interest in the Project to a Chinese investor. Likewise, Wei Fisher, a former FMG executive assistant, was not cross-examined about her evidence of a letter from CMCC on about 3 February 2005, in which she recalls that CMCC claimed that the \"deal\" with the Chinese contractors was off. In ASIC v Rich , Austin J stated at [494] that ASIC invoked the rule in Browne v Dunn by submitting that, to the extent that evidence from witnesses for ASIC went unchallenged that evidence should be accepted citing Knight v Maclean [2002] NSWCA 314 at [34] - [35] . Austin J also quoted the following from the list of consequences of failure to comply with the rule in Browne v Dunn as addressed by the learned authors of Cross on Evidence at [17460]; (b) if a witness has not been cross-examined on a particular matter, that may be a very good reason for accepting that witness's evidence, particularly if it is uncontradicted by other evidence; Austin J noted that in Vines v ASIC [2007] NSWCA 75 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 1 at [62] Spigelman CJ stated that the rule in Browne v Dunn is a rule of practice designed to achieve procedural fairness, and therefore, when it is claimed that the rule has been departed from and that consequences should follow, the first consideration to be considered by the court is whether there has been some procedural fairness that needs to be addressed. That requires the assessment of \"matters of fact and degree\". Austin J stated at [495] that these observations of Spigelman CJ suggest that it would not be wise to accept the general proposition that Browne v Dunn should be applied whenever the evidence of ASIC's witnesses was not challenged. Instead, he said, the correct approach is to consider each particular occasion upon which consequences are said to flow from failure to put a matter to a witness, so as to take into account matters of \"fact and degree\". In the present matter, ASIC did not expressly submit that the evidence of Li and Fisher on the matters that it alleges were not challenged in cross-examination should be accepted. It is however implicit. Their evidence was contradicted by contemporaneous documentary evidence in relation to the negotiations between FMG and the Chinese Contractors. This lead me to reject their evidence in those respects. Section 19 admissions Generally, as ASIC contends, the evidence upon which it relies to establish the alleged contraventions is documentary, and founded upon FMG's own business records. It sought however to supplement this evidence by certain alleged admissions by Rowley and Watling, derived from transcripts of examinations conducted by ASIC pursuant to s 19 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (the ASIC Act). ASIC tendered signed transcripts of examinations conducted pursuant to s 19 of the ASIC Act of Rowley and Watling. The transcripts were sought to be tendered under ss 81 and 87 of the Evidence Act as evidence of admissions made on behalf of FMG. On 29 April 2009, during the trial, I ruled that, upon proof of the authenticity of the examinees' signatures and my satisfaction that the transcripts contain relevant admissions, the transcripts were admissible: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Fortescue Metals Group Ltd [No 2] (2009) 176 FCR 529 at [44]. ASIC subsequently identified the portions of the transcripts upon which it relied. It set out what it described as \"propositions\" emerging from those portions. Those propositions were set out in separate documents in respect of Rowley (MFI No. 4) and Watling (MFI No. 5) under the heading \"Vicarious admissions against interest\". The propositions constitute the alleged admissions made by each of Rowley and Watling. Rowley's alleged admissions in his s 19 examination and proffered by ASIC as admissions by FMG pursuant to s 87 are: At all material times Rowley was a director of FMG. The knowledge he acquired in his capacity as such was therefore FMG's knowledge. [p 5 lines 15-36] Rowley, and therefore FMG, knew, from at least 14 October 2004, that the Chinese Government had decided that the equity issue was to be resolved before there was to be further progress. [p 58 lines 8-9 39-45; p 59 lines 1-4 ] ] Rowley, and therefore FMG, knew, from around 14 October 2004, that: NDRC had directed the Chinese Steel Mills not to deal directly with FMG any further, but rather to deal through (C)MCC; the process of trying to get off take agreements signed with specific steel mills had started to slow down; this had been orchestrated by the NDRC; and there was not going to be progress until there was an agreement about equity. [p 59 lines 6-17] Rowley knew or believed that negotiations in relation to the equity participation were probably first raised when FMG started negotiations post CREC and started to involve (C)MCC and the wider China. At around that time NDRC became very much a party. [p 66 lines 27-34] As at 22 January 2005, Rowley, and therefore FMG, knew or believed that CREC, CHEC and (C)MCC were not acting on their obligations because: the issue of equity had not been resolved; and as far as China was concerned, until that issue was resolved, the agreements as they stood would not be actioned. [p 67 lines 5-7; p 69 lines 8-17] Watling's alleged admissions in his s 19 examination and proffered as admissions by FMG pursuant to s 87 are: At all material times Watling was a senior member of FMG's management in charge of managing infrastructure development. The knowledge he acquired in his capacity as such was therefore FMG's knowledge. [p 4 lines 34-48; p 5 lines 1-2] Watling, and therefore FMG, knew, from some time after the signing ceremony on 5 November 2004 between November and December 2004, that: the size of the equity which the Chinese required was going to become a major issue; the NDRC was instructing (C)MCC which was instructing CREC and CHEC in that regard; and CREC (by Mr Kean) could not progress further because of the equity issue. [p 85 lines 16-45] ASIC said each admission by Rowley and Watling was adverse to the interests of FMG because it showed that \"FMG knew matters that were inconsistent with the representations it was making to the market\" in the period, in relation to: Rowley, from 14 October 2004 onwards; and Watling, from a date in November 2004 after 5 November 2004. In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum [2004] FCA 1678 ; (2004) 141 FCR 183 , Merkel J, who was dealing with admissions in the context of proceedings against a company under the TPA, stated at [118]: \"(c) Admissions in the s 155 examinations [118] Although s 84(2) of the (Trade Practices) Act does not extend to admissions (see TNT Management at 19 and Trade Practices Commission v Nicholas Enterprises Pty Ltd (1979) 26 ALR 609 at 633 (\" Nicholas Enterprises \")), there are a number of circumstances in which the admissions of a servant or agent in relation to past events may be admissible against the principal. A servant or agent may have authority to make admissions about past events by virtue of the servant's or agent's general or specifically delegated authority to answer inquires of a particular nature: see TNT Management at 18. The inquiries may include dealing with investigating authorities in any matter concerning the business: see Nicholas Enterprises at 632. Merkel J noted at [120] that s 87(1)(b) of the Evidence Act has been applied in the context of cases brought pursuant to the TPA such as Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Mayo International Pty Ltd (1998) ATPR 41-653. Senior counsel for ASIC submits that s 87 of the Evidence Act may be applied to admissions in a s 19 transcript in the same way as it was applied in ACCC v Leahy [2004] FCA 1678 ; 141 FCR 183 to admissions made in examinations under s 155 of the TPA. I accept that submission. Senior counsel for FMG did not take issue with the authenticity of the signatures of Rowley and Watling on the transcripts. He also indicated that FMG had no objection to my reading those transcripts and deriving from them whatever assistance I could. However, he said the representations in the transcripts could not be viewed as admissions because they were not adverse to FMG's case. In Part 1 of the Dictionary of the Evidence Act , \"admission\" is defined as follows. admission means a previous representation that is: (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding); and (b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding. As set out above, ASIC submits that Rowley's transcript discloses that from around 14 October 2004 he, and therefore FMG, knew that the NDRC had directed the Chinese Steel Mills not to deal directly with FMG any further, but rather to deal through CMCC. In this respect, at pages 58 and 59 of the transcript of the s 19 examination, Rowley was referred by the examiner to a letter he sent to Mr Bai dated 14 October 2004. Rowley agreed that he sent the letter to Bai \"on around about\" 14 October 2004. The examiner and Rowley continued to discuss matters relating to equity, CREC communicating with the NDRC and the MOC and the NRDC's orchestration of the Chinese Contractors' discussions with FMG. Rowley did send a letter to Bai of CREC dated 14 October 2004, the full text of which is set out below in these reasons. However this letter contains no reference to equity negotiations, the MOC or the NDRC and deals only with FMG's concern about CREC's slow progress on technical issues. There was no other letter from FMG dated on or around 14 October 2004 in which the matters discussed by the examiner and Rowley were discussed. I conclude that ASIC is incorrect in relying on 14 October 2004 as the date on or around which Rowley had knowledge of the matters he discussed with the examiner on pages 58 and 59 of the transcript. Other documentary evidence, however, demonstrates that David Liu of FMG stated in an email to Rowley dated 14 November 2004 that: I was informed that last Friday NDRC held a meeting with representatives form Provincial NDRC branches in Beijing to specifically discuss FMG. Basically the message was to tell steel mills to inform the authority first before signing contracts with FMG. Rowley was not present at the meeting where the NDRC's direction was given and nor was Liu. This is a different proposition to what Rowley said in his examination. Furthermore, the notes of the discussions between FMG and CMCC on 25 November 2004 by teleconference and at CMCC's offices in China indicate that the NDRC had appointed CMCC as the leader of the consortium of Chinese entities involved with the FMG project. These notes record the presence at those meetings of Forrest, Watling and Liu but not Rowley. This fact was not controversial. It is therefore not clear how Rowley, and through him FMG knew, from at least 14 October 2004, or from around that date of the matters of which he speaks as set out in his transcript at pages 58 and 59. I conclude that Rowley's alleged knowledge of these matters cannot qualify as an admission against FMG as he did not have any personal involvement in, or knowledge of, the relevant factual matters to enable him to make such admissions. Additionally the problems concerning the claim for majority equity did not arise until late November 2004. In any event, I am not satisfied that the statements by Rowley and Watling in the s 19 transcripts relied upon by ASIC constitute admissions under the Evidence Act because they cannot be said, in my view, to be adverse to FMG's interest in the outcome of the proceeding in the sense postulated by ASIC, namely, that those statements were inconsistent with the representations FMG was making to the market at the time. I have found elsewhere in these reasons that FMG knew as a matter of commercial reality that NDRC approval was necessary at broadly two levels: contractual then provision of finance for performance. It obtained the first and reasonably expected to obtain the second. This knowledge did not, as I have found, render FMG's announcements to the ASX and to the market misleading or deceptive. Indeed the statements said to constitute admissions by FMG through Rowley and Watling presume the existence of binding agreements between FMG and the Chinese Contractors. That Rowley and Watling knew of the difficulties created by the NDRC for the performance of the framework agreements does not further ASIC's cases against FMG and Forrest. Nothing said by Rowley or Watling constitutes an admission that the framework agreements were mere agreements to negotiate an agreement to build, finance and transfer the infrastructure or that they were of no legal effect. PART 4: THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENTS Early developments In 2003 and early 2004, FMG had meetings in China with various Chinese parties. FMG's Head of Marketing, Philip Kirchlechner, David Liu, then an FMG Consultant who later became FMG's Head of China Business and Watling, FMG's Head of Port and Rail, went there in January 2004 to establish whether Chinese companies could provide selected infrastructure equipment within a tight time frame and produce a quality product at a commercially competitive rate. FMG delivered a detailed presentation of its Project to CREC. Kirchlechner, who was called to give evidence by ASIC, said CREC expressed strong interest in building the railway for FMG. According to its publicity brochure, CREC is a super-large multidisciplinary group corporation employing a total of 301,000 people whose business covers the full range of construction-related activities including surveys and designs, installation and construction, manufacturing, research and development, technical consulting, project supervising and provisional transport management. In 2003, CREC ranked number 27 among China's 'Top 500 Enterprises'. Since its establishment over 50 years ago, CREC has taken part in the construction of over 100 railways. Since China's reform and opening up, CREC has worked internationally on projects involving the construction of railways in more than 50 countries and regions in Africa, Japan, the Middle East, and Asia. During the January 2004 trip to China, FMG made a presentation with respect to harbour and dredging works to CHEC, one of the top three dredging companies in the world. CHEC described itself in its publicity brochure as a 'well-known giant group' company employing 49,000 people and as the national leading force in the field of navigational channel dredging and harbour construction. Its activities include engineering design, construction and supervision for harbour, road, and bridge construction. It has designed and constructed nearly all of the large and medium-sized ports and navigational channels in China. It had also been involved in bridge construction projects in Thailand. A further FMG delegation which included Rowley, Watling and Liu visited China in April 2004. During this trip, FMG's representatives had separate meetings with representatives of CREC and CMCC. CREC, by its Vice President Mr Bai Zhongren, ( Bai ) reiterated that CREC was keen to build the railway for FMG through a so-called 'Build and Transfer' (BT) contract and indicated that it had both the intention and the capacity 'to bring their own finance'. Bai said that CREC intended to be repaid by either a lump sum payment or instalments upon commissioning of the rail project. He also said that he had been in contact with CHEC and CMCC and that both companies were waiting for CREC to take the lead in respect to FMG's Project. According to Ed Heyting, Project Manager of Infrastructure of FMG, who was called to give evidence by ASIC, CREC was both very experienced and competent. On 23 April 2004, FMG hosted a cocktail party at the Australian embassy in Beijing, which representatives of CREC, CHEC, CMCC, NDRC, SASAC and other parties attended. According to Heyting, it was clear from the April 2004 meetings that CREC was very anxious to \"do this project\" with a view to enhancing market perception of the company by building a railway in a first world country such as Australia. Prior to August 2004, CREC had indicated to FMG that its preference was to be involved in the detailed designing process and to be awarded the construction work without tendering. FMG however said this was not its preferred position. The parties then contemplated entering into an MOU to start the engineering designing process. The CREC Framework Agreement Heyting prepared a first draft of a framework agreement for CREC in July 2004. A CREC delegation was due to come to Western Australia in August 2004. FMG's aim, explained in FMG's July 2004 monthly report, was that this delegation would carry out a due diligence on site and then negotiate the scope and general terms for a build and transfer contract for the railway. This was confirmed, in substance, in an email of 21 July 2004 from Liu of FMG to Zhang, CREC's project manager for the Project. An updated itinerary for the CREC visit over the period Monday 2 August 2004 to Saturday 7 August 2004, written in both Chinese and English, was circulated by email to FMG executives by Louise O'Reilly of FMG on 27 July 2004. This itinerary had been provided by David Liu to Zhang of CREC by email dated 26 July 2004. It included an introduction to Worley, the DFS manager and a site visit to the Pilbara. It also included for Friday 6 August at FMG's office \"Discussions on MOU on BT agreement, JV arrangement\"; and for Saturday 7 August also at FMG's office \"Finalise BT Agreement\". O'Reilly sent an updated itinerary by email to Heyting on 2 August 2004. In that itinerary, it was stated that Bai would be arriving on the night of Wednesday 4 August 2004. This updated itinerary contained no mention of an MOU and instead stated that on Thursday 5 August there would be a 10.00 am presentation on \"Financials\" by \"CC\", whom I take to be FMG's Chief Financial Officer Christopher Catlow, followed by \"Negotiations for the day\" involving \"Senior Management\". The only activity listed for Friday 6 August was \"Signing Agreement\". Heyting said the aim was not to negotiate an MOU. He gave evidence-in-chief at [40] that he was asked by an unidentified superior to use a word for the draft document that conveyed more substance than an MOU. He conceded that he would have been directed by someone at a higher level to aim to negotiate a scope and general terms for a build and transfer contract for the railway. Heyting sought to resile from his concession that he was aiming to produce a build and transfer contract, saying he aimed to produce an \"agreement\", not a \"contract\". This evidence was far from persuasive. He accepted that he wanted the document to record an offer by one party and an acceptance by the other, knowing these to be essential elements of a contract. In his witness statement at [43], Heyting said that to his knowledge no written or formal offer was made by CREC or accepted by FMG. However, under cross-examination he conceded that CREC made an oral offer to execute the work. On 2 August 2004, Heyting distributed the draft framework agreement. The draft agreement had 2 recitals and 3 clauses. The oral offer made by CREC to carry out the works was reflected in his Recital B which stated: CREC, having closely examined all proposed documents, has submitted an offer to execute the Works and the FMG has accepted the CREC's offer and the parties now wish to evidence their agreement. Clause 1 of the draft agreement was headed \"Framework\". Clause 2 was headed \"Scope of Work\". Clause 3 which later became clause 7 was headed \"Further Agreements\" and provided that the document \"represents an agreement in itself and it is recognised a fuller and more detailed agreement not different in intent from this agreement will be developed latter (sic)\". Heyting said that he inserted this clause for the express purpose of ensuring enforceability of the agreement. As planned, senior executives and technical representatives of CREC, including Bai, visited Western Australia from 3-6 August 2004. Heyting said they carried out due diligence on the Project. They had access to a very large number of documents; visited Port Hedland and the mine site; were given a number of presentations, including by Worley, and had discussions about the DFS. Even prior to the delegation, as evidenced by an email from Zhang to David Liu dated 28 July 2004, CREC had realised the importance of the DFS and its central position in a relationship with FMG. Heyting said that based on his discussions with CREC prior to the signing of the CREC Framework Agreement, CREC remained anxious to \"do\" the project. He said that his discussions ended on the Thursday 5 August, the day prior to the signing of the agreement. Heyting said that he was not involved in all the negotiations between CREC and FMG. These negotiations led to amendments to the 2 August draft. In particular, a third recital was added. Four extra clauses were added: \"General Conditions of Contract\" (clause 3); \"Schedule\" (clause 4); \"Approval\" (clause 5); and \"Relevant Laws\" (clause 6). Clause 3 made reference to payment terms, including a provision that FMG would provide security to CREC in the form of a \"JORC classified resource to the value of the Works\". JORC is an acronym derived from Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee. Clause 5 included a provision that the agreement \"will become binding upon the approval of both the Board of Directors of CREC and the Board of Directors of FMG. \" The CREC Framework Agreement was signed on 6 August 2004. A copy of this is contained at Schedule 'B'. On 13 August 2004, the directors of FMG, by circular resolution, authorised Forrest to sign a joint statement with a representative of CREC to bind FMG to the CREC Framework Agreement. The joint statement recited that the parties had signed the framework agreement \"in good faith\" and that in accordance with clause 5 Qin, as Chairman of the board of directors of CREC and Forrest for FMG approved that the Framework Agreement \"will become binding on the signing date of this Statement\". Later in August 2004, Forrest, David Liu and Kirchlechner were in China for meetings with representatives of various Chinese companies, including steel mills, CREC, CHEC and CMCC as well as government authorities. On 19 August 2004, they met with CREC's representatives, including Qin and Bai, to sign the joint statement to bind the parties to the CREC framework agreement. The occasion was recorded in an internal FMG trip report. According to that report , a formal signing ceremony was conducted in CREC's exhibition hall; Forrest and Qin signed the joint statement on behalf of their respective boards; Qin made it clear that the FMG project was a significant one, and that it dove-tailed nicely with the strategic development of CREC; and photographs were taken, both formally at the ceremony and informally afterwards. The signing ceremony it appears was a high level, serious, and, by Chinese custom, solemn occasion. Kirchlechner accepted that the parties were entering into a serious agreement and were expecting that each party would fulfil its obligations under the agreement. On 19 August 2004, Catlow sent an email to FMG's directors and other officers advising that Forrest had signed the CREC Framework Agreement Joint Statement rendering the agreement binding and that \"We are working on a public release that is acceptable to CREC and FMG\". The same day, Catlow provided a draft media release, in relation to the CREC Framework Agreement, to John Field, Managing Director of Field PR. It included the statement that CREC \"has signed an [agreement type] to build\" the rail infrastructure. Later that day, Catlow forwarded Field's draft to Forrest and others, but before doing so he removed \"an [agreement type]\" and inserted in its place the words \"a binding agreement\". At the request of FMG, a trading halt was placed by the ASX in respect to FMG shares on 20 August 2004. The same day, Catlow emailed a draft media release to Bai of CREC, asking him to \"consider the attached release and let me have your approval as soon as possible\". The draft release, in its first paragraph, stated that CREC \"has executed a binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd's ('ASX:FMG') $1.85 billion Pilbara iron ore project\". Also on that day, a query arose within FMG as to whether the CREC Framework Agreement was binding or whether, in order to make it binding, it required Chinese government approval. This transpired to be a misunderstanding caused by the content of an email sent that day by Zhang of CREC to Heyting. In fact, the reference by Zhang, in his email, to government approval, concerned not the FMG-CREC framework agreement but a proposed MOU between CREC and Barclay Mowlem Construction Limited (Barclay Mowlem), an Australian based construction company. Later that day Forrest advised Catlow by email, referring to the FMG-CREC framework agreement: \"Confirmed with Mr Bai direct. Ours is binding\". Zhang again emailed Heyting that day to confirm that government approval concerned the CREC and Barclay Mowlem MOU and not the CREC-FMG agreement. Despite widespread media coverage of the release in both China and Australia, there was no correction sought by CREC to the 23 August Media Release which by reference was incorporated as part of FMG's notification to the ASX. As is clear from the evidence of Field who also attended the November 2004 ceremony, every relevant entity in the room saw the 5 November Letter. ASIC accepted in its opening that there was evidence that CREC approved the 23 August Media Release. Senior counsel for ASIC, in opening, also advised the Court that CREC did not seek to disabuse anyone as to the correctness of the content of the 23 August Media Release prior to the publication of the AFR Article. I will deal with the matter of Chinese government approval in relation to the CREC Framework Agreement in more detail later. On 23 August 2004, FMG sent the 23 August Letter to the ASX and issued the 23 August Media Release. I infer that CREC approved the material wording in the media release and in particular the characterisation of the framework agreement in the release as a \"binding agreement to build and finance the railway ...\". I think it is very unlikely that FMG would have published the media release without CREC's endorsement once this had been requested. Both Heyting and Forrest, as I have explained, were at pains to ensure there was no ambiguity concerning Government approval. I am persuaded that this cautionary approach would also have been taken to the matter of the media release. Furthermore, in its MOU signed with Barclay Mowlem on 1 September 2004 CREC expressly acknowledged that it had \"entered into an agreement with FMG on 19 th August 2004 for the build and transfer of the Project as attached hereto...\". The MOU was signed by Bai for CREC. Attached to the MOU was a copy of the CREC Framework Agreement. Expediting the rail project Following the signing ceremony with CREC on 19 August 2004, Bai of CREC invited the FMG delegation for meals on three occasions. During a farewell lunch held on Monday 23 August 2004, Bai raised issues relating to expediting the rail project. This lunch was held after the 23 August Letter had been sent to the ASX. The letter was received by the ASX at 12.41am on 23 August and it was publicly released by the ASX at 9.37am. The issues raised by Bai on 23 August 2004 were set out in an email from David Liu to Forrest, Rowley and Catlow dated 24 August 2004: - FMG needs to reach agreement with Chinese steel company(s) on Chinese investment into minority equity of FMG mine(s). This policy was clearly stated to FMG team by the Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce and will greatly facilitate the Chinese contractors to acquire financing for BT. (This is the most important point of all) - FMG needs to demonstrate it is capable of financing 10% deposit before the formal signing of BT agreement. To a large extent, it is expected to show its certainty of financing arrangement for the project at the time. - FMG needs to display legal, effective evidence when using its iron ore resources as security for BT payment. Liu also reported in that email that CREC would send a team of 4-5 designers and engineers to Perth to work with Worley before September 6. He said CREC would take care of their own airfares, food and accommodation, and that FMG would assist in arranging their accommodation and would provide translation and interpretation. He also said the CREC team would most likely be stationed in Worley's office. Further, Liu reported that CREC would form a work committee specifically to handle all related work on FMG. He also said \"It was suggested quietly by CREC that we need to push CHEC and CMCC to get on board asap, if they hesitate, CREC is more than willing to general contract the entire project in cooperation with several Australian partners. \" It appears that FMG did contemplate getting CREC to carry out construction work for the Project additional to the work on the railway. This is evident from notes of a meeting involving Heyting and two representatives from Barclay Mowlem at the FMG office on 15 September 2004, where it is reported that FMG had approached CREC to carry out the dredging and marine structures for the port, but that the Chinese government was not keen for CREC to do that and it would look like \"Harbour Works\", which I take to be a reference to CHEC, would \"possibly look\" at doing that work. On 31 August 2004 Forrest sent a letter to Bai in which he addressed the three important issues raised by Bai at the lunch held on 23 August 2004. In relation to the first issue, minority equity participation, Forrest said FMG welcomed equity participation by Chinese steel mills in an FMG mine; that it had been encouraging Chinese entities to invest in its Project from the outset; and that all of its memoranda of intent with customers included an investment clause. As to the second issue, capacity to pay the 10% deposit, Forrest referred to FMG's market capitalisation of more than $120 million, and its ownership by very large international institutions including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Jardine Fleming as well as by management. He also referred to letters of financial support from General Electric, ThyssenKrupp, Siemens and other large international groups. Further, he said the US capital markets had expressed strong support for the Project and that major fund managers across the United States, Europe and Australia had expressed a keen interest in participating in all major capital raisings. He also said FMG would carefully assess all of the many financing options open to it and make a formal recommendation as to the optimal financing structure for the Project. In relation to the third issue, security to CREC, Forrest said FMG would provide CREC with effective security over the agreed value of the agreement by lodging iron ore bonds with CREC. He said the bonds would provide CREC with specific security over defined tonnes of iron ore and that once the payments relating to the security were made, the bonds would be returned by CREC to FMG. There was no suggestion in reply by Bai that the CREC Framework Agreement was anything other than a binding build and transfer agreement. On 14 October 2004 Rowley wrote to Bai as follows: Dear Mr Bai We believe you understand that your sincere cooperation and success with FMG in Australia will provide a good opportunity and start for CREC to get into the International Market in the Western World. FMG's choice of CREC as a partner can achieve a win-win situation. However, this win-win situation can only be achieved through active communication and solid effort. We have received your advice and itinerary concerning your proposed meetings in Australia with Barclay Mowlem. However, prior to you holding meetings in Australia with potential partners and suppliers, we want you to advise us on the steps CREC propose to take to ensure that we share a common view and that our project will be completed in time to ship our first ore at the end of 2006. As you are aware this target completion date is critical to the success of our project. While I am aware of your great personal commitment to FMG, Australia and a prosperous China, since FMG signed the Agreement I have become concerned that we have not agreed or achieved the necessary milestones to allow shipment of iron ore by the all critical fourth quarter 2006. Consequently, I respectfully request that among the first steps in your itinerary is to make a presentation to FMG that outlines your time line and critical dates for project implementation. This presentation should include your schedule for discussions with potential partners and equipment suppliers. Since the signing of the Agreement, FMG has not progressed our discussions with such groups believing that that role more appropriately sits with CREC. However, we nor China can ill afford a delay or break in this communication if our project is to meet the proposed time line. Your early advice on the date and time for this presentation would be appreciated. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd Mr Graeme Rowley DIRECTOR OPERATIONS On 20 October 2004 Rowley sent an email to Watling, Kirchlechner and David Liu, which was copied to Forrest and Catlow, stating that they had two challenges: \"one, to get CREC off the fence and start moving on our project and two, to sign Agreements with CHEC and (C)MCC\". Rowley also stated: \"In addition, Andrew (Forrest) is of the belief that we should take the opportunity to ensure CHEC and CMCC do not repeat CREC's \"slow motion\". Rowley went on to state in that email: \"With respect to CREC, our strategy has been to put Mr Bai on notice of our concerns and this has been done\". I find that FMG had earlier implemented that strategy by Rowley's letter of 14 October 2004. Zhang of CREC replied on behalf of Bai by email to Heyting dated 18 October 2004 (21/691). In that email, he gave assurance that CREC was keeping to its commitment to work hard on the financing issues and follow up according to FMG's proposed schedule for the Project, but that this was subject to modifications whenever needed. CREC representatives visited Western Australia in late October 2004 and participated in discussions with FMG and Worley. Heyting informed representatives of Worley by email dated 15 October 2004 that: The objective of this visit is that CREC go away with an understanding of Australian design standards, WA safety requirements and practices, Australian work practices and why they have evolved ie high labour costs, etc. This is to ensure that when CREC commence detail design and plan the construction phase they comprehend what working in the Pilbara means. Worley's meeting agenda for the CREC visit stated that the objective was: \"To provide an understanding of the design standards and construction methodology proposed for the railway and exchange technical understanding or alternative approach's (sic) which may be proposed by the CREC. \" The CREC representatives arrived in Perth on or around 22 October 2004, and among other things, they visited Port Hedland with Li of FMG. Li had a conversation with Liang who was the assistant to Zhang on its FMG rail project, and reported in an email a number of matters to Rowley from that conversation. Li stated that her personal feeling about the CREC was that: CREC is genuinely interested in FMG project. FMG's project could move forward or not is very much dependant on if some Chinese company can become the share holder of FMG mines or not; this is the regulation from Ministry of Commerce and CRED (sic) has little control over it. Therefore the potential China investors are very keen to know the grade and the reserve of FMG mines as accurately as possible, which is very understandable from their risk. During the October CREC visit, CREC and Barclay Mowlem had direct discussions in relation to the Project, following the signing of the MOU on 1 September 2004. Bill Killinger, Director and General Manager (Rail), of Barclay Mowlem informed Forrest and Catlow in an email dated 3 September 2004 that the MOU between Barclay Mowlem and CREC was to \"enter in to an exclusive Joint Venture to work jointly within the Framework Agreement signed between CREC and FMG\". On 16 September 2004 Barclay Mowlem issued a media release announcing its MOU with CREC. In an email dated 13 October 2004, Zhang of CREC told Heyting, with reference to its joint venture involving Barclay Mowlem: \"please be assured that CREC-JV with BMCL will implement the project fully to your satisfaction without technical obstacles\". CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements Meanwhile, CHEC's representatives had visited FMG in Western Australia in late September/early October 2004. In addition, CMCC's representatives visited Western Australia from 10 October 2004. The CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements were signed by the parties around the time of those visits: the CHEC Framework Agreement on 1 October 2004 and the CMCC Framework Agreement on 20 October 2004. The board of directors of FMG approved the agreements on 3 November 2004. Copies of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements are contained at Schedules 'C' and 'D' respectively. Heyting had a hand in the initial drafting of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. CHEC, as well as CMCC, had informed FMG that they only wanted to sign an agreement in the same form as the CREC Framework Agreement. On 23 September 2004 David Liu informed Heyting by email that plans had been made for three senior engineers from CHEC to visit FMG in Perth on 28 September 2004. The next day Heyting sent an email to Rowley, Forrest and Catlow setting out a program for the visit. The program was similar to that arranged for the earlier CREC visit. Heyting produced a draft of the CMCC Framework Agreement as early as 3 September 2004. On 26 September 2004 David Liu informed Forrest in an email that he had sent a \"BT agreement\" to CMCC \"a few weeks ago\", and that it had not honoured its promise to sign it. I infer that the agreement Liu was referring to was the CMCC Framework Agreement. Prior to the CMCC visit, Liu informed Forrest by email dated 3 October 2004 (19/579) with reference to CMCC that: I will talk to them tomorrow, making sure that they do not harbour any out of line ambitions other than replicating what CREC and CHEC have agreed with FMG. By email dated 5 October 2004, Liu informed Jim Williams, FMG's Head of Mining Operations of the impending visit to Western Australia by CMCC. Here CMCC is referred to as \"MCC\". Please find the attached Framework Agreement we intend to sign with China Metallurgical Construction Corporation. There would be five delegates from MCC who would visit us around 10th October, mainly persons in charge of Overseas Division of MCC and senior engineers. They indicated that they came with the blessing of Mr Ma, President of MCC, whom FMG delegates had met several times in Beijing. Basically MCC was told by the Chinese Government agencies like NDRC and Ministry of Commerce not to be left beind by China Rail and China Harbour. It was also indicated to me that they could not see much problem for the delegation to do the due diligence and for Andrew to sign formally the BT Framework Agreement with Mr Ma around October 20. The trip was delayed a few times, mainly due to the fact that MCC wanted to see clear government support to facilitate financing. I will keep you fully informed about the progress. It is clear, in my view, that following the signing of the framework agreements, CHEC and CMCC as well as CREC were committed to performing their obligations under the agreements, though not at the level of intensity that FMG were demanding, as demonstrated by Rowley's letter to CREC of 14 October 2004. One reason for the Chinese delay is provided by David Liu's statement in his email of 5 October that \"CMCC wanted to see clear government support\" to facilitate financing . FMG and Worley's monthly reports on the progress of the DFS contain references to participation in the DFS by CHEC and CMCC. FMG's November 2004 monthly report stated that CHEC had sent out a geotechnical engineer to view the marine and onshore geotechnical field work and testing, and that it had held discussions with FMG's geotechnical consultant, Coffey, and Worley on design aspects associated with the interpretation of the final results. The report also stated that a CMCC delegation was undertaking a series of technical sessions in Perth with FMG, Worley and companies involved in the Project as well as a site visit. The aim of this visit was to build up CMCC's understanding of factors including design requirements, Australian safety practices and Pilbara work practices. The report also said that in parallel, CMCC was undertaking a due diligence for potential investment in an FMG mine. FMG's December 2004 monthly report stated that the CMCC delegation had completed its due diligence and technical session in Perth. The December report also stated that further discussions were held in China with all three Chinese companies and that planning was underway for a combined delegation to visit in January to resolve outstanding commercial issues. Subsequently, representatives of CREC, CHEC and CMCC did visit Perth in January 2005 to discuss various issues, including the matter of equity as I will explain later. On 5 November 2004 a formal ceremony was held the Australian embassy in Beijing for the signing of the Joint Statements necessary to make the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements binding in accordance with their express provisions. Kirchlechner circulated a formal programme for the ceremony, which included speeches by: Forrest who was introduced by Mr Kym Hewett, Senior Trade Commissioner at the Australian Embassy; Dr Alan Thomas, Australia's Ambassador to China; and Mr Wang Xiaoqi, Director General, Bureau of Planning and Development of SASAC. The programme also included the introduction of Bai of CREC; Yang Changheng (Yang), Chairman of CMCC; Chen Yongkuan (Chen), Vice President of CHEC; and Barry Haase, Federal Member for Kalgoorlie. Finally, the programme recorded the attendance of representatives of the Australian contractors ThyssenKrupp, Barclay Mowlem, BGC Contracting and Leighton Contracting. Field from Field Public Relations (Field PR) placed copies of the 5 November Media Release, which announced the making of the agreements with CHEC and CMCC, as well as referring to the earlier agreement with CREC, on every chair in the auditorium and in front of the Chinese persons who were signing the agreements. This was consistent with FMG seeking approval from Bai before the release of the 23 August Media Release. ASIC does not suggest that the Chinese expressed any disagreement with the terms of the 5 November Media Release. There was no complaint at the time or anytime before 24 March 2005. The conduct of the Chinese Contractors and the NDRC was entirely consistent with the belief, of FMG and Forrest that the contents of the 23 August Media Release and the 5 November Media Release were accurate. Field believed that the agreements were binding on the basis of what he observed at the signing ceremony. He knew that the 5 November Media Release had been widely distributed and observed that no-one questioned its contents. He also arrived at that conclusion from seeing the media interviews afterwards. The signing of these two framework agreements on 5 November 2004 was publicised widely in China as well as Australia. For example, the Xinhua Financial Network News covered the announcement. It reported FMG's announcement report made at a news conference which was consistent with the 5 November Media Release. At no point before 24 March 2005, despite this widespread coverage in Australia and China, was there any correction made to such reporting by any of the Chinese Contractors. Nor was there any correction made by the NDRC or any other Chinese government authority. Nor was there any qualification made to any of the reporting such as that government approval had yet to be forthcoming or that the agreements were conditional upon an equity arrangement being achieved between FMG and a Chinese entity. I infer that CHEC and CMCC were satisfied that the content of the 5 November Media Release as well as other media reports in China were accurate. PART 5: PUBLICLY KNOWN FACTS PRIOR TO THE AUGUST AND NOVEMBER 2004 ASX NOTIFICATIONS There is little controversy, if any, as to what was publicly known prior to the August and November 2004 notifications to the ASX by FMG and much of what follows is taken from written submissions of FMG. In June 2004 a prefeasibility report (PFR) on the Project was completed. The PFR concluded that the Project had the potential to be an attractive investment proposition. The PFR recommended that the Project warranted further investment to undertake a Definitive Feasibility Study. The stockbroking firm and market analyst, Patersons Securities Ltd (Patersons), observed in its 5 April 2004 report that the Project was an \"early stage project development concept\" in respect of which it highlighted \"the risks are numerous\" and that the conditions precedent to financial close of the Project were \"the completion of a feasibility study, proof of financially robust project economics, completion of environmental, Aboriginal and heritage permitting and approval issues, and both equity and debt fundraising commitments\". It advised that FMG was a \"speculative buy\". Mr Sisson, a share portfolio manager and one of ASIC's experts agreed with Patersons assessment and added that FMG would have been categorised by common investors or by the market as a speculative investment. He said that the share market did not value FMG on the assumption that its plans to become a producer of iron ore were likely to come to fruition. DFS In July 2004, the appointment of Worley as the manager of the DFS was announced by FMG to the ASX as well as by its own news release. This release opened with the statement: The fight to free up greater development of Australia's rich iron ore deposits stepped up today with a key appointment (of Worley) by Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (\"Fortescue Metals\") for its $1.85 billion Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project. The news release reported Forrest as saying that completion of the DFS was targeted by the first quarter of next year. It went on to explain how the $1.85 billion figure was comprised: a $450 million mining and processing facility, a new advanced $930 million railway open to all users between the Pilbara and Port Hedland, and the injection of $470 million of new dedicated iron ore loading and berthing facilities at Port Hedland. The appointment of Worley received considerable media coverage including an article in the Australian Financial Review on 9 July 2004 14/194. In that article, it was stated: Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group is pushing ahead with its ambitious $1.85 billion plan to become a third force in Western Australia's Pilbara iron ore industry by appointing Worley Group to manage a definitive feasibility study. Fortescue hopes to join the global miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton as a supplier of iron ore from the Pilbara by 2006-07, pending the results of the study, due by the first quarter of 2005. The appointment of Worley to manage the DFS was also the subject of comment by research analysts. A report by Macquarie Research Equities dated 9 July 2004 on Worley and released to the public stated that it had won the right to conduct a feasibility study on the proposed $1.85bn Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project for Fortescue Metals Group. The report however cautioned: While the $1.85 billion number sounds impressive, FMG is a very small company with only $9 million in cash, according to its last quarterly. The company is managed by - Andrew Forrest (the person behind the original Murrin Murrin development now part-owned by MRE). The project involves a $450 million mine, $930 million railway and $470 million port and aims to be producing by FY 2007. The feasibility study is the first step in the process towards obtaining finance for the project. This last observation was further publicly recognised in a Reuters report dated 23 August 2004 which stated: The railway depends on a feasibility study into the iron ore project, which is scheduled to be completed early next year. According to Sisson, an expert called by ASIC, the market understood in August that the DFS was expected to define the scope, design, costs and economic viability of the works. Heyting said that among other things, the DFS was intended to define the scope of the works, define scheduling requirements for the building of the component parts of the project, delineate a resource base to render the project commercially viable, and consider issues such as native title and environmental studies with a view to determining the cost and viability of the Project. He added that the aim of the DFS was to enable finance for the Project to be raised. He conceded that these matters were well-known in the market. Accordingly a successful DFS was of the utmost importance, and would have been so understood by the market. Sisson acknowledged that without a DFS concluding that there was a viable project no bank would lend to the Project, and FMG's directors would consider that they could not proceed. For the Project to proceed, FMG had to prove that it had a sufficient quantity of JORC compliant resource to support the proposed mining operations. It had not done so and there was significant doubt in the market as to whether it would do so. Sisson said that the generally accepted view was that the Project needed close to 2 billion tonnes of iron ore to be commercial. As at 23 August 2004, FMG had only reported 390 million tonnes of JORC compliant Indicated and Inferred Resource at a very low iron grade: announcements of 10 May 2004 (iron grade 50% reported) and 29 June 2004 (average iron grade 56.7% reported). Sisson agreed that in his experience iron ore with an average grade of 50% would certainly require benefication. There was publicly-expressed doubt in the media, such as the Business Review Weekly of 2 August 2004, about FMG's capacity to extract sufficient quantities of iron ore with the requisite quality to support the Project. On 16 August 2004, FMG announced that it had identified significant tonnages of 'direct ship ore' at its Christmas Creek tenements and significant quantities of microplaty haematite in varying concentrations from Mt Nicholas through Mt Lewin to Christmas Creek, a distance of some 100 kms. This announcement was widely reported in the press including the Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire of 16 August 2004 and The Australian newspaper of 17 August 2004. However an article in the Australian Financial Review of 17 August 2004 again expressed doubts, perhaps even cynicism, as to this new information. The announcement prompted an inquiry from the ASX on that same day as to whether the microplaty haematite was either a JORC compliant resource or reserve. FMG's answer was that it would announce JORC indicated resources at Christmas Creek by 30 September 2004, but JORC defined resources were not currently available at Christmas Creek. Sisson considered that the market would have assumed from the 16 August 2004 announcement that the reserves were not JORC compliant. In short, as Sisson explained, there was significant doubt about FMG's capacity to extract significant quantities of ore with the requisite quality to support the Project. Investors, he said, would have been aware of these doubts, and \"that's why the share price was still 55 cents\" as at 23 August 2004. In fact FMG's share price closed at 55 cents on 19 August 2004 and opened at 65 cents on 23 August 2004. FMG needed to obtain finance in order to complete the DFS. On 9 August 2004, it announced that the DFS would cost $34 million. FMG had invested $12 million, and with the investment of $7 million by JF Capital, a further $15 million approximately was required. The news that FMG needed to obtain funds to carry the DFS through to completion was widely reported in the media. An early stage project development concept By 23 August 2004, FMG had not secured any firm, long term off-take contracts for the purchase of iron ore. Sisson said this was publicly known. FMG had only secured some memoranda of intent which were announced on 8 December 2003. By 23 August 2004, FMG had not obtained any of the regulatory or statutory approvals required to construct the Project infrastructure. These included state agreements, environmental approvals and Aboriginal and heritage permission. As Sisson acknowledged, all this was publicly known. General market opinion of FMG in August 2004 reflected an air of scepticism. The market, according to Sisson, thought that executives of the company were imbued with a sense of over-optimism. Further, Field gave evidence that prior to October 2004, there was a lot of scepticism in the market about the prospects for the Project. Sisson said that there was also scepticism about Forrest. He referred in his report dated 10 March 2008, by way of illustration, to an article written by Mark Drummond of the Australian Financial Review of 2 February 2004 which included: Mr Forrest has his share of sceptics who dismiss the Pilbara plan as a pipe dream pointing to the near collapse of his pioneering laterite nickel development, Anaconda Nickel's Murrin Murrin Project. By 23 August 2004, the analysis of Patersons of 5 April 2004 still held true and the publicly known facts indicated that FMG had no more than \"an early stage project development concept\". Sisson agreed with that description, adding that perhaps it was at an \"early to middle stage\". Summary of publicly known facts By early November 2004, the Project had to some extent progressed. However significant contingencies for its success remained unfulfilled. As at 5 November 2004, the following facts were publicly known: FMG was still in the process of undertaking a DFS, which was due for completion in the first quarter of 2005. FMG still needed to raise all the funds required for completion of the DFS. Subsequent to the announcement of 9 August 2004 saying that a further $15m was required, the only announcement of funds raised was as to $7 million announced on 13 October 2004. FMG had held numerous discussions with potential financiers and advisors in relation to the funding for the Project and a number of domestic and multinational finance groups had undertaken due diligence reviews of FMG's data room: FMG's Quarterly Report, 30 September 2004. However, funding was still unclear. The market understood that actual funding for the Project was contingent or conditional on a successful completion of a DFS. FMG had defined JORC compliant reserves in the order of 1.13 bt, including the 390.8 mt in respect to Mt Nicholas, before Christmas Creek became the focal point, compared to a target of 2 bt. Further drilling was to be undertaken with results to be released later in the year. The 390.8 mt was reported in FMG's Quarterly Report of 31 March 2004. A further 744 mt was announced on 30 September 2004. It was the subject of a media release of that date, and was stated in FMG's Quarterly Report of 30 September 2004. There was still reported uncertainty as to whether FMG would be capable of defining sufficient resources to support its operations, and uncertainty as to whether FMG would be capable of profitably extracting iron ore from an area which had already been tested and relinquished by BHP and Rio Tinto. This uncertainty existed in relation to both quantity and quality of its reserves. There was considerable media and analyst coverage of these matters. Of the 744 mt defined from drilling at Christmas Creek, Mt Lewin and Clayton's Hammer, the estimated average iron ore grade was only about 56% which according to Sisson is low by the standards of BHP and Rio Tinto. FMG was in the process of finalising a State agreement with the Western Australian government, but this had not yet been approved. This too was reported in the media for example on 24 August 2004 by AAP, 1 October 2004 by the Australian Financial Review, by market consultants Patersons' report of 30 September 2004 as well as by FMG in its Quarterly Report, 30 September 2004. FMG had entered into the CREC framework agreement. FMG had entered into three firm sales agreements for a total of 8 mt of iron ore per annum. Its target was 45 mt per annum. These sales agreements were the subject of announcements by FMG on 6, 13 and 21 October 2004. Again they received wide coverage in the media. FMG had reached agreement with Aboriginal elders regarding access to a highly prospective mineralisation site in a section of the Christmas Creek tenement area: FMG's ASX announcement of 15 September 2004. FMG had negotiated customer prepayments under all three sales contracts and had made an additional placement of 7 million shares to one such customer at a price of $1.00 per share. The additional placement was covered in the announcement of 13 October 2004. Barclay Mowlem on 1 September 2004 signed an MOU with CREC to build, in joint venture, the railway component of the Project. This was publicised in media reports during September 2004. The railway was in the course of being planned incorporating what FMG described as innovative track mapping technology generated by Quantm Limited, with whom an agreement had been signed in March 2004: FMG's Annual Report 2004. It is in the context of these publicly-known facts that a common investor's understanding of the announcements of August and November falls to be assessed. PART 6: THE AUGUST AND NOVEMBER 2004 NOTIFICATIONS TO THE ASX There were three letters and two hyperlinked media releases relied upon by ASIC as notifications to the ASX by FMG in respect to its s 674 case. The two media releases are said by ASIC to form part of the notification by FMG to the ASX under s 674 as each is, in effect, imported into the respective letters by reference. I have set out below the several notifications and incorporated media releases as well as ASIC's submissions as to their effect. The 23 August Letter On 23 August 2004 at 9.37am, the ASX released a letter received that morning from Catlow as follows: China Signs to Build Railway Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (\"FMG\") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding contract with China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) to build and finance the railway component of the Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project. The \"Build and Transfer\" (BT) contract covers the railway from the Company's iron ore tenements in the Chichester Ranges to the export hub at Port Hedland. The contract covers all earthworks, culverts, bridges, rail, sleeper and rolling stock requirements, with the exception of locomotives which will continue to be sourced internationally and may form an addition to this agreement. CREC is China's largest construction group, having constructed 40,000 kilometres of rail networks throughout the country. FMG is confident in CREC's ability to build the heavy axle load railway in the Pilbara pursuant to the BT contract. CREC plans to become Asia's top construction company within 3 to 5 years and this contract provides them with a platform for further international growth. CREC has commenced discussions with Australian based engineering and construction groups with a view to forming local joint ventures to meet its obligations pursuant to the contract. We refer to the media release on the Company's website at www.fmgl.com.au. ASIC submits that the plain wording of the notification unequivocally states that FMG and CREC have entered into a contract of the type known as a \"Build and Transfer (BT) contract\" legally obliging CREC to build and finance the railway component of the Project which meaning is confirmed by the following hyperlinked media release. The 23 August Media Release At or very shortly after 9.37am on 23 August 2004, FMG published that media release on its website as follows: CHINA SIGNS TO BUILD FORTESCUE METALS' MULTI-USER IRON ORE RAILWAY IN THE PILBARA China's largest construction group, China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), has executed a binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd's (\"ASX: FMG\") $1.85 billion Pilbara iron ore project. Australian-based Fortescue Metals said it had signed the \"Build and Transfer\" (BT) contract in Beijing with CREC - which is also one of the world's largest rail construction groups. Speaking from China today, Fortescue's Chief Executive Officer, Mr Andrew Forrest said this contract is a major breakthrough for Fortescue Metals in its development of open access and multi-user independent railway and port facilities in the Pilbara. \"This long overdue facility will liberate otherwise stranded major deposits across the Pilbara and ensure that Australia doesn't continue to lose its share of important growing overseas markets,\" he said. \"BT contracts are common in the international engineering and construction industry. Under such contracts, the provider designs to customer specification (AS 9000), builds, commissions and then transfers the facility to the customer once agreed performance specifications have been met, an achievement known as \"Practical Completion\",\" Mr Forrest said. The contract underwrites the project's independent rail line from Fortescue Metals' mine sites at its massive Chichester Ranges iron ore deposits in the Pilbara to Port Hedland, the export hub for the province's iron ore shipments. CREC will also source and finance the bulk of the rolling stock for the project, providing the platform for the rapid advancement of the project. \"The further development of the Pilbara has until now been restrained by the lack of an independent railway system. This agreement provides for that vital new infrastructure to be built. Finalising this contract with CREC now paves the way to finance the rest of the project in a plain, vanilla manner should the Company so wish,\" said Fortescue's Chief Financial Officer, Chris Catlow. The rail link is the largest component in Fortescue Metal's Pilbara project which also includes a proposed A$410 million iron ore mine and $470 million in new port facilities at Port Hedland. The President of China Railway Engineering, Mr Qin Jiaming, said from Beijing today that the Fortescue Metals' contract presented an excellent opportunity for CREC to develop internationally. \"This new Pilbara project dove-tails both CREC's short and long-term development strategy,\" Mr Jiaming said. \"CREC is fully confident about its capacity to build a heavy axle load railway in the Pilbara, a project able to deliver significant economic benefits to both Australia and China,\" he said. The contract covers all earthworks, culverts, bridges, rail, sleeper and rolling stock requirements for the new rail line. CREC has already commenced discussions in Perth and Beijing with Australian and international engineering and construction groups (operating in Australia) with a view to including minority joint venture interests in the contract. Locomotives for the Fortescue Metals' railway will continue to be sourced internationally and may form an addition to this agreement. \"This is the catalyst we have been working on to propel our Pilbara project into real-time construction, project financing and project commencement stages,\" Mr Forrest said. Under the terms of the contract, CREC will take full risk under a fixed price agreement on the rail project which Fortescue Metals proposes be held separate to the parent company, in a new entity called The Pilbara Infrastructure (TPI). Fortescue Metals has previously announced its intentions of retaining only a maximum 40% interest in TPI which Mr Forrest said may be listed on international stock exchanges. \"We continue to receive interest from parties seeking to invest in and develop a controlling interest in the rail and port facilities being pioneered in the Pilbara by Fortescue Metals\", Mr Forrest said. Mr Forrest said CREC had clearly indicated an appetite to work with Australian companies on joint venture agreements covering the new rail network. CREC is a State-owned enterprise in China with work in hand of US$12 billion, prior to signing with Fortescue Metals. It is set to become a Fortune 500 Company next year and aims to become the top Asian construction company in three to five years. CREC has constructed 40,000 kilometres of rail networks throughout China, as well as 1,800 kilometres of rail bridges and a similar length of rail tunnels. Fortescue Metals earlier this month announced the discovery close to surface at its main Christmas Creek project in the Chichesters, of substantial tonnes of high quality microplaty haematite ore over only the initial iron ore deposits explored within that project area. The ore is in high demand by Chinese and Japanese steel mills as it requires little beneficiation before processing, and offers superior blast furnace performance. Fortescue Metals has the largest package of tenements (>16,000 sq kms) in the Pilbara province and has appointed the internationally recognised Worley Group Limited as Definitive Feasibility Study Managers for the project. Mr Forrest said today's agreement kept the Company's aspirations for first iron ore deliveries in the 2006 - 2007 financial year \"on track\". The Company has previously announced that its proposed Pilbara rail network would be open to access by other users. Media Contact: Andrew Forrest Kevin Skinner Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) Field Public Relations (08) 9266 0111 / 0402 097 191 (08) 8234 9555 / 0414 822 631 A dial-in conference call is scheduled for 10:00am (WST), 12:00 noon (EST) on Monday 23 August 2004. Details as follows; Phone No: 1800 063 720 Account No: 75104808 Guest PIN: 7643 The 5 November Letter On 5 November 2004 at 8.10 pm, ASX released an unsigned letter received that morning from Mr Rod Campbell, the Company Secretary of FMG which stated as follows: Design, Construct and Finance Agreements for Port, Rail and Processing Plant Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (\"FMG\") is pleased to announce that it has executed binding contracts with China Harbour Engineering Corporation (\"China Harbour\") and China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (\"China Metallurgical\") pursuant to a design, build and finance arrangement for the respective project component parts of FMG's Port Hedland ship loading and stockyard facility and FMG's Mine Processing Plant. The ceremony was officiated by Mr Wang Xiaoqi, the Director General of the Bureau of Planning and Development and of the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC). From Australia, Mr Barry Haase, Federal Member for Kalgoorlie, officiated with the formal support of the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Geoff Gallop, and the Minister for State Development for Western Australia, Mr Clive Brown. The ceremony was also attended by senior representatives from other major corporations already committed to the project including ThyssenKrupp, ABB, Barclay Mowlem, Leighton Contracting and BGC. These contracts follow a binding agreement signed with China Railway Engineering Corporation (\"China Rail\") in August 2004 whereby the largest project component part being the rail line from Port Hedland to the proposed mine site in the Chichester Ranges, is to be delivered under a design construct and finance structure substantially in the same form as those signed today. FMG has now established a broad platform for the delivery of the three major component parts of its AUD1.85 billion Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project on terms and conditions that take full advantage of the expertise and balance sheet strengths of the contracting party. This has the effect of placing the majority project risk with the construction parties. Further, the payment terms for the 90% balance are structured on a staged basis effectively providing a finance facility for this substantial portion of the total project cost. FMG in return for a bank guarantee from the contracting parties will fund the initial 10% of the project value. This balance is being quickly filled by customer pre payments and we are actively pursuing further joint ventures. The Chinese Government owns the three companies that have committed to design, construct and finance the Fortescue project. They are all the largest and leading participants in their respective areas of operation within China. All three enterprises have international experience and their preferred operating methodology is to involve local expertise particularly in regard to design and construction. As previously announced, China Rail signed an agreement with Barclay Mowlem pursuant to the rail project which will provide them with significant local knowledge given Barclay Mowlem were a major contractor under the Alice Springs to Darwin rail line. Currently there are a number of Australian companies in China developing working relationships with China Harbour and China Metallurgical to bring similar levels of expertise to their particular areas of interest. FMG believes that the high level of engagement being actively sought by the various Chinese groups covering both product purchase agreements and project construction relationships is clear evidence of the desire held by many Chinese corporations to see FMG firmly established as an important supplier of iron ore into the future. For further information we refer to the media release on the Company's website at www.fmgl.com.au. ASIC submits that the plain meaning of this notification was that the Chinese Contractors had agreed to execute and finance the infrastructure works for FMG's Project on terms and conditions that contained an agreed price and that placed majority Project risk with the construction parties. It contends that no other meaning is reasonably available. The 5 November Media Release On 5 November 2004 at 8.12 pm, the ASX also published the 5 November Media Release which had been prepared by Kevin Skinner, Senior Consultant of Field PR, in conjunction with FMG executives including Forrest, Catlow, Chief Financial Officer, and Julian Tapp, FMG's Head of Government Relations. This was hyperlinked to the 23 August 2004 Letter and was in the following terms: CHINA TO FUND NEW A$1.85 BILLION AUSTRALIAN IRON ORE AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT Australia's newest iron ore project is to be financed and built by three of the largest state owned companies in China in a near A$2.0 billion fillip for Australia's resources sector. Binding contracts announced and signed this afternoon in Beijing commit Chinese financing and construction support for the A$1.85 billion iron ore and infrastructure project proposed by Fortescue Metals Group Limited in Western Australia's Pilbara. The new agreements with China Harbour Engineering Group (China Harbour) & China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (China Metallurgical) are the latest breakthrough for Fortescue Metals and Australia in opening up a major new iron ore supply source and corridor to burgeoning overseas markets by 2007. Also in Beijing today as signatory partners to the construction commitments were some of the largest multi-national and Australian engineering, metallurgical, project management and construction firms, and equipment suppliers which will participate widely in the project's development. The contracts announced today follow the binding agreement with China Railway Engineering Corporation (China Rail) announced by Fortescue Metals in August this year. The three agreements now form a total project construction and finance solution as follows: - Mine : China Metallurgical will provide a financing, design, and construction package for the mine and beneficiation plant at Christmas Creek - Railway : China Rail has committed to the financing, design, and construction of the heavy haul open-access rail line and associated rolling stock, between the Chichester Ranges and Port Hedland - Port : China Harbour will provide the financing, design and construction for the large-scale works covering the dredging, train unloading, or stacking, blending and ship loading facilities at Fortescue Metals' selected export outlet at Anderson Point in Port Hedland. - Other Significant Multinational and Australian involvement : Corporates already committed to the project include ThyssenKrupp, ABB, Barclay Mowlem, Leighton Contracting, and BGC. The ceremony was officiated by Mr Wang Xiaoqi, the Director General of the Bureau of Planning and Development of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State of the Council (SASAC). From Australia, Mr Barry Haase, Federal Member for Kalgoorlie, officiated with the formal support of the Premier of Western Australia, Dr Geoff Gallop, and the Minister for State Development for Western Australia, Mr Clive Brown. \"These commitments by Chinese interests now cover the financing and construction risk for the total project,\" Fortescue Metals' Chief Executive Officer, Mr Andrew Forrest, said today. \"Our approach has been to ensure that construction risk is carried by the contractors and that project payment by Fortescue Metals only follows Practical Completion,\" Mr Forrest said. Since June this year, Fortescue Metals has raised A$14.5 million in new share capital through two separate share placements and signed long term binding sales agreements that contain prepayment commitments of A$66 million payable either at financial close or during the term to first product shipment. \"The three contracts will now limit Fortescue's initial financing requirement to less than 10% of the estimated $1.85 billion total project cost with the balance covered largely by prepayment commitments. These commitments from customers provide cost effective finance that does not have an equity dilution effect for existing shareholders in Fortescue Metals. Despite this we are not ruling out further joint ventures with Chinese and other mutli-national corporations\" Mr Forrest said. \"The construction funding significantly enhances the economic value of the project by de-risking the development phase - often an issue with greenfields project financing,\" he said. \"The involvement of China in the financial packaging and construction schedules for all three elements of this massive undertaking, is the birth of a new Sino-Australian partnership that will be a major boost for the Australian and Chinese economy. Significantly it has Fortescue on target for 2007 start up as the new Australian source of long-term quality iron ore supply to mills in the Asian region. As announced in recent weeks, FMG's first batch of long term binding sales contracts provides for a total delivery commitment of 8 million tonnes of iron ore per annum of an estimated initial production level of 45 million tonnes per annum. Mr Forrest said that it was significant that the \"contracts were signed soon after Fortescue Metals announced its interim resources exploration results from Christmas Creek. The qualitative analysis of the materials sent a clear signal as to the product type and grade being targeted for production in the 2006/07 financial year - and has been increasingly acknowledged by international steel mills. \" ASIC again submits that the only way to understand this media release is that it states that the Chinese Contractors have entered into binding obligations to execute and finance the infrastructure works for FMG's Project on terms and conditions that limit the price to a figure less than the estimated $1.85 billion Project cost and that impose the construction risk on the contractors. The 8 November Letter The 8 November Letter delivered on that date to the ASX was almost identical, so far as it concerned the three agreements, to the draft of the Letter which was shown to Walsh of the ASX also on that date. The ASX publicly released this letter on 9 November 2004 at 9.45 am. It was in the following terms: Additional Information on China Harbour and China Rail Agreements Fortescue Metals Group Ltd (\"FMG\") is pleased to announce further developments to the agreements signed with China Harbour Engineering Corporation (\"China Harbour\") and Metallurgical Group of China (\"China Metallurgical\") pursuant to the design, build and finance arrangement for the respective project component parts of FMG's Port Hedland ship loading and stockyard facility and FMG's mine processing plant. As mentioned in Friday's ASX release, there were a number of Australian companies present at the signing ceremony that were in varying stages of forging closer ties with the Chinese companies. FMG can now advise that two of those Australian companies have also recently signed separate agreements with China Harbour and China Metallurgical. ThyssenKrupp Engineering (Australia) Pty Ltd (\"ThyssenKrupp Engineering\") has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Harbour and China Metallurgical for the development of an ongoing working relationship with each of these companies for the FMG project. BGC Contracting Pty Ltd (\"BGC\") has also signed a similar Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") with China Metallurgical. The MOU's signed by ThyssenKrupp Engineering and BGC follow similar lines to that entered into between Barclay Mowlem and China Rail in that it creates a strategic relationship with a local operator that has the requisite experience and knowledge of Australian conditions. BGC is a well known and highly regarded Western Australian private company. Among a range of diverse construction activities, BGC has been involved in a number of large scale resource and mining projects in northern Western Australia and has the requisite skills for a central project role. ThyssenKrupp Engineering's direct parent company ThyssenKrupp Foerdertechnik is the world market leader in the fields of mining, materials handling and processing equipment with ten business units operating across all five continents. The ultimate group parent ThyssenKrupp AG is a global operation and recognised as a market leader in steel, capital goods and services. The involvement of well credentialed Australian operators with each of China Rail, China Harbour and China Metallurgical collectively provides further momentum to FMG's inexorable progress toward becoming the \"new force in iron ore\" in Australia. As reported on Friday, FMG now has the three important component parts of its Pilbara Iron Ore Infrastructure Project (ie. rail, port and processing plant) covered within three separate agreements. The aggregate capital cost of the assets covered under the respective agreements is estimated at A$1.7 billion. All three Chinese companies will be working with FMG and the Worley Group within the Definitive Feasibility Study process to establish a firm price which will then be incorporated into a fixed price contract with each party. As contemplated under the respective agreements entered into to date, the first stage of work covering design and engineering will allow for the confirmation of a mutually agreed set price for embodiment into formal construction contracts. As announced on Friday, the payment structure set within all three agreements requires an initial 10% of the contract price to be paid prior to commencement of work. When paid, the contractor will issue FMG with a corresponding bank guarantee for the same amount which will be released when 10% of the work is completed. The balance of the contract price is payable following practical completion under each agreement. FMG believes this to be one of the most important features of the arrangement as it places the majority risk with the construction entity. As further advised on Friday the staged payment terms post practical completion then allow FMG up to three years before final payment is due which creates opportunities to refinance these obligations under longer term arrangements. FMG is in discussion with a number of capital market groups regarding such refinance opportunities. The benefit of the abovementioned staged terms and the ability to show financiers an operating history of several years is considered a further important advantage accruing under the China agreements. Security under the respective agreements has been determined as being a charge or similar style interest pledged by FMG to the contractor over an amount of JORC defined iron ore \"in ground\" resource for a dollar amount to cover the value of works under contract. In summary the project achievements of the last few days have been extensive and provide a continuing platform for these component parts of the project to be advanced in parallel to ensure the Detailed Feasibility Study process is finalised within the set timeframe. ASIC submits that, by its title, this letter purported to provide \"additional information\", rather than \"corrective information\" concerning the CREC, CHEC and CMCC agreements. It observes that there is nothing in the 8 November Letter that states that FMG is retracting or correcting anything said about the CREC, CHEC or CMCC agreements in its earlier notifications of 23 August or 5 November and in that vein, commences with information relating to subcontractor arrangements, rather than the terms of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC agreements. ASIC submits that investors and other readers would continue to believe and understand that the Chinese Contractors were legally bound to design, build, construct and finance the infrastructure. Furthermore, in light of the additional information, they would believe and understand that the Chinese Contractors had assumed all or most of the construction risk. However, ASIC contends there is nothing to suggest that a discerning and informed investor reading the 8 November Letter would appreciate that all FMG had achieved was the prospect of discussing the terms for designing, constructing and financing the Project with Chinese parties. PART 7: THE CONTINUOUS DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS History The legislative history of the continuous disclosure provisions was reviewed by Lindgren J in Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Southcorp Ltd [2003] FCA 1369 ; (2003) 130 FCR 406 at [7] - [16] . I gratefully adopt his Honour's review in part: [7] A review of the legislative history of the continuous disclosure provisions shows the importance that the legislature and the regulator have attached to them, and the publicity which has been given to them. [8] In June 1991 the then Commonwealth Attorney-General, Michael Duffy, requested the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee (the Committee) to examine the need for a legislatively-based continuous disclosure regime. [9] The Committee reported in September 1991. It noted that while the Corporations Law (the Law) required disclosure of information in particular sets of circumstances, it did not contain a comprehensive scheme for the full and accurate disclosure of market sensitive information on a timely basis. The Committee noted that Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules required a listed company or trust to notify its home exchange \"immediately\" of any information that was necessary to avoid the establishment of a false market in its securities, or that was likely to affect materially the price of its securities. The Committee recommended the introduction of a statute-based enhanced disclosure regime which would: overcome the inability of general market forces to guarantee adequate and timely disclosure by disclosing entities; encourage greater securities research by investors and advisors, thereby ensuring that securities prices more closely, and quickly, reflect underlying economic values; ensure that equity and loan resources in the Australian market are more effectively channelled into appropriate investments, and that funds are withheld or withdrawn from poorly performing disclosing entities. This will promote capital market efficiency; assist debt holders in monitoring the performance of disclosing entities and thereby determine whether, or when, to exercise any right to withdraw or reinvest their loan funds, or convert debt to equity; act as a further, or substitute warning device for holders of charges over corporate assets, that breaches in covenants may have taken place, or the risk of default has increased; assist potential equity or debt holders of disclosing entities to better evaluate their investment alternatives; lessen the possible distorting effects of rumour on securities prices; minimise the opportunities for insider trading or similar market abuses; improve managerial performance and accountability by giving the market more timely indicators of corporate performance; encourage the growth of information systems within disclosing entities. This assists directors in their decision making and compliance with their fiduciary duties; and reduce the time and costs involved when preparing takeover and prospectus documents. [10] Following a process of consultation, the Government decided to introduce continuous disclosure provisions into the Law. On the Second Reading Speech on the Corporate Law Reform Act (No 2) 1992 (Cth), which contained continuous disclosure provisions proposed to commence on 31 December 1993, Senator Bolkus, Minister for Administrative Services, stated: ... an effective disclosure system will often be a significant inhibition on questionable corporate conduct. Knowledge that such conduct will be quickly exposed to the glare of publicity, as well as criticism by shareholders and the financial press, makes it less likely to occur in the first place. In essence, a well-informed market leads to greater investor confidence and, in turn, to a greater willingness to invest in Australian business. ( Australia, Debates, Senate , (1992), p 3581) [11] The continuous disclosure provisions were eventually introduced as ss 1001A, 1001B, 1001C and 1001D of the Law by the Corporate Law Reform Act 1994 (Cth) s 4 , Sch 1, Item 92, and commenced on 4 September 1994. Subsection 1001A(2) provided that a listed disclosing entity must not contravene the continuous disclosure provisions of the listing rules of a securities exchange applicable to the entity, by 'intentionally, recklessly, or negligently' failing to notify the securities exchange of information that was not generally available, and which, if it were generally available, a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the securities of the entity. In November 1996, the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee (CASAC) conducted a review of the continuous disclosure regime introduced in 1994, and released a report entitled \"Report on Continuous Disclosure\". In that review, a survey had been conducted of listed disclosing entities. The CASAC report concluded that the regime was operating effectively for those entities. The report stated at para 1.7: Respondents to this survey considered that continuous disclosure had helped to keep the market, and investors in listed disclosing entities, more informed. Continuous disclosure also reinforced the obligations on directors and management to disclose material information to the market. Respondents considered that investors gained a better and more timely understanding of the issues facing the company and how these might affect the value of their shares. Continuous disclosure also encouraged listed entities to formalise their lines of internal communication to ensure that the directors and senior management were fully informed of all events affecting the price or value of the entity's securities. Overall, the respondents considered that continuous disclosure encouraged greater investor confidence in the price discovery mechanism of the securities market. The majority of the 70 listed disclosing entities who responded to the CASAC survey, indicated, in relation to question 22 dealing with external advice, that they had sought professional advice, mainly from law firms, on the application of continuous disclosure requirements. That advice included whether disclosure was required in the circumstances, the operation of the provisions which created exceptions to mandatory disclosure, and whether certain information would have a material effect on the price or value of securities. The present case includes consideration of whether legal advice was given to FMG concerning FMG's continuous disclosure obligations; the effect of any such legal advice and the reasonableness of the defendants' reliance on any such advice. On the commencement of the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth) on 11 March 2002, s 1001A, which contained the original continuous disclosure obligations, was replaced by s 674 in a new Chapter 6CA of the Act. The Revised Explanatory Memorandum for the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001 explained that the placement of the continuous disclosure provisions near Chapter 6D reflected the fact that these provisions deal with ongoing disclosure obligations in relation to securities as defined for the purposes of Chapters 6D and 7. The Revised Explanatory Memorandum also explained: Proposed section 674...generally replicates section 1001A of the Corporations Act , subject to changes in terminology. In order to comply with the Criminal Code , the fault elements currently contained in subsections 1001A(2) and (3) have been omitted and the default fault elements under the Code will apply in future to offences against this provision. Proposed section 678 applies the Criminal Code to all offences in Chapter 6CA at commencement. The Revised Explanatory Memorandum also explained that contravention of the continuous disclosure provisions would give rise to a liability for financial services civil penalty provisions, in line with the approach taken to a number of other prohibitions related to market misconduct. The Criminal Code is contained in the Schedule of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) and contains principles of criminal responsibility which have applied from 15 December 2001 to all offences against Commonweath law, including the Corporations Act . The present matter does not involve consideration of the principles of criminal responsibility as ASIC seeks only orders in the way of pecuniary penalties, disqualification and compensation pursuant to the civil penalty provisions set out in s 1317E. The Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Act 2004 (Cth) introduced further changes to the continuous disclosure regime, including: raising the maximum pecuniary penalty for a corporate entity from $200,000 to $1 million. However, the maximum civil penalty for an individual remained at $200,000; introducing personal liability for contraventions of the regime by broadening the list of continuous disclosure civil penalty provisions to include new subsections 674(2A) and 675(2A) dealing with persons \"involved\" in a contravention of the regime. However, an individual involved in a contravention would only face a pecuniary penalty if the contravention was \"serious\" (s 1317G); providing a mechanism for ASIC to issue an infringement notice containing financial penalty to a disclosing entity for an alleged contravention of the regime. This mechanism was intended to apply to relatively minor contraventions; introducing a due diligence defence for a person involved in a contravention: subsection 674(2B) in relation to a listed disclosing entity; and subsection 675(2B) in relation to other disclosing entities. The due diligence defence was not part of the original Bill and was introduced by an amendment to the Bill in the Senate by Senator Coonan on 17 June 2004: Senate Official Hansard No 7 2004, 15-18 June 2004, pp 24167-24168. A Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum for the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Bill 2003 stated that the due diligence defence for persons involved in a contravention of the continuous disclosure provisions, s 674(2B), would be included in the Act. The Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum explained that: 4.82 ...This defence is proposed to address concern expressed that persons involved in the management of a disclosing entity may be considered to have contravened the continuous disclosure requirement even though they had done their best to ensure that the entity complied with its continuous disclosure obligations. 4.83 The defence requires that the person took all steps that were reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the disclosing entity complied with its continuous disclosure obligations, and believed on reasonable grounds that the disclosing entity was complying with those obligations. Paragraph (a) of each proposed defence encompasses the assessment whether particular information is required to be disclosed and the process for disclosing it. 4.84 The notion of reasonable steps is obviously for the court to decide on the facts of a particular case and may include, in appropriate circumstances, instances of delegation and reliance on others. 4.85 The phrase 'in the circumstances' refers to all the conditions surrounding the disclosing entity's compliance with its subsection 674(2) (and 675(2)) obligations and may include, for example, the circumstances of the person taking the steps (including his or her role) and of the disclosing entity, and the nature of the information. 4.86 Further, the defence relates to the steps taken to ensure compliance in relation to the particular information referred to in subsection 674(2)(b) or 675(2), as appropriate. In his reply following the second reading speech on 16 February 2004, the then Treasurer, Mr Costello, stated in relation to the due diligence defence: It is not the government's intention that a person who has taken all reasonable steps to comply with their individual responsibility should be liable for contravening the act. It is the government's intention that the showing of due diligence by persons in relation to this responsibility should be a defence...The defence would operate so that an individual would not be personally liable where a breach of the continuous disclosure obligation occurs where the person took all reasonable steps to ensure that the disclosing entity complied with its continuous disclosure obligations and, after doing so, believe on reasonable grounds that the disclosing entity had complied with its obligations. The approach is modelled on a similar defence applying in relation to the prospectus provisions of the act. The provisions Sections 674, 676 and 677 relevantly provide as follows: 674 Continuous disclosure---listed disclosing entity bound by a disclosure requirement in market listing rules Obligation to disclose in accordance with listing rules (1) Subsection (2) applies to a listed disclosing entity if provisions of the listing rules of a listing market in relation to that entity require the entity to notify the market operator of information about specified events or matters as they arise for the purpose of the operator making that information available to participants in the market. (2) If: (a) this subsection applies to a listed disclosing entity; and (b) the entity has information that those provisions require the entity to notify to the market operator; and (c) that information: (i) is not generally available; and (ii) is information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of ED securities of the entity; the entity must notify the market operator of that information in accordance with those provisions. (2A) A person who is involved in a listed disclosing entity's contravention of subsection (2) contravenes this subsection. (2B) A person does not contravene subsection (2A) if the person proves that they: (a) took all steps (if any) that were reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the listed disclosing entity complied with its obligations under subsection (2); and (b) after doing so, believed on reasonable grounds that the listed disclosing entity was complying with its obligations under that subsection. ... (4) Nothing in subsection (2) is intended to affect or limit the situations in which action can be taken (otherwise than by way of a prosecution for an offence based on subsection (2)) in respect of a failure to comply with provisions referred to in subsection (1). 676 Sections 674 and 675---when information is generally available (1) This section has effect for the purposes of sections 674 and 675. (2) Information is generally available if: (a) it consists of readily observable matter; or (b) without limiting the generality of paragraph (a), both of the following subparagraphs apply: (i) it has been made known in a manner that would, or would be likely to, bring it to the attention of persons who commonly invest in securities of a kind whose price or value might be affected by the information; and (ii) since it was so made known, a reasonable period for it to be disseminated among such persons has elapsed. (3) Information is also generally available if it consists of deductions, conclusions or inferences made or drawn from either or both of the following: (a) information referred to in paragraph (2)(a); (b) information made known as mentioned in subparagraph (2)(b)(i). 677 Sections 674 and 675---material effect on price or value For the purposes of sections 674 and 675, a reasonable person would be taken to expect information to have a material effect on the price or value of ED securities of a disclosing entity if the information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of the ED securities. Listing Rule 3.1 relevantly provides: Immediate notice of material information 3.1 General rule Once an entity is or becomes aware of any information concerning it that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the entity's securities, the entity must immediately tell ASX that information. Listing Rule 19.12 defines various expressions. Among the defined expressions is \"aware\" which is said to have the following meaning: an entity becomes aware of information if a director or executive officer (in the case of a trust, a director or executive officer of the responsible entity) has, or ought reasonably to have, come into possession of the information in the course of the performance of their duties as a director or executive officer of that entity. The ASX is, by virtue of reg 7.1.01(a) of the Corporation Regulations 2001 , a \"prescribed financial market\". At all material times FMG has been listed for quotation on the ASX. The ASX Listing Rules have applied, according to their terms, to FMG's shares. Hence, the ASX is a \"listing market\", and FMG's shares are \"ED securities\" (enhanced disclosure securities) for the purposes of s 111AE of the Act. Pursuant to s 111AM of the Act, the ED securities of FMG are \"quoted ED securities\". It follows that, according to the definition in s 111AL(1), FMG is a \"listed disclosing entity\", because the ED securities of FMG are quoted ED securities. In summary: s 674(2) applies to a listed disclosing entity if provisions of the listing rules of a listing market in relation to that entity require the entity to notify the market operator of information about specified events or matters as they arise for the purpose of the operator making that information available to participants in the market: s 674(1). That requirement is satisfied by Listing Rule 3.1 in combination with the definition of 'aware' in Listing Rule 19.12; s 674(2) requires notification to the ASX of materially value or price sensitive information that is required by the Listing Rules to be notified to ASX, and notification is to be made in accordance with the Listing Rules. S 677 is effectively an interpretative provision as to when a reasonable person would expect information to have the requisite material effect on the price or value of securities. There is an apparent distinction between Listing Rule 3.1 which requires that the information be expected to have a \"material\" effect on the price or value of the securities and the deeming provision in s 677 of the Act which requires only that the information would or would be likely to \"influence\" common investors. This was considered by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in Jubilee Mines NL v Riley (2009) 253 ALR 673 in respect of equivalent provisions in the continuous disclosure provisions in the Corporations Law and the ASX Listing Rules. In Jubilee Mines 253 ALR 673 the provisions of the Act relating to continuous disclosure were at that time located in Chapter 7, Part 7.11, Div 2. They were relocated to Chapter 6CA by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 . The relevant continuous disclosure Listing Rule was Rule 3A(1) --- the equivalent of that Rule is now Rule 3.1. The equivalent of s 674, s 675 and s 677 that were considered are s 1001A, s 1001B and s 1001D respectively. In Jubilee Mines 253 ALR 673 the issue was whether Jubilee, a small listed gold exploration company that wanted to transition into a gold producing company had to disclose information that it received, in 1994, of drilling results about the nickel development potential of its tenements, on receiving that information from a neighbouring tenement holder Western Mining Corporation Ltd, which had inadvertently conducted drilling on Jubilee's tenements. When such information was released in 1996, there was a resultant increase in Jubilee's share price. But, in 1994, Jubilee was focussed on gold and was short of cash, without the necessary ability to develop any nickel assets. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal from a judgment of a master of the Supreme Court, and held that there had been no contravention of s 1001A essentially because the information was held to be not material in 1994. Martin CJ delivered the main judgment with which Le Miere AJA agreed. McLure JA delivered a separate judgment. Martin CJ rejected the argument that the Listing Rule can only be contravened if a reasonable person would expect the information to have a material effect on the price or value of a company's securities quite independently of the question posed by s 1001D. His Honour said the better view is that s 1001D applies to the Listing Rule, with the consequence that if information has the characteristic defined in that section, it should be taken to be information falling within the scope of the Listing Rule: [34], [54]-[62]. This was for the reason that acceptance of the argument would create an inconsistency between the Listing Rule on the one hand and ss 1001A and 1001D on the other, which would not have been intended by Parliament. The inconsistency would be that the Listing Rule would require notification only when there was a reasonably expected material impact on share price or value, whilst ss 1001A and 1001D would require notification whenever the information would, or would be likely to influence common investors: [60]-[61]. In a separate judgment, McLure JA considered whether s 1001D supplants the third element of the Listing Rule, namely materiality and concluded that because s 1001D was stated to apply for the purposes of s 1001A and s 1001B but not the Listing Rule; and because s 1001A and s 1001B apply only if information is not generally available, unlike the Listing Rule, which applies regardless, s 1001D did not describe materiality for the purposes of the Listing Rule: [149]-[150]. At [165] McLure JA also referred to the \"obvious terminological differences\" between the tests in s 1001D and the Listing Rule. Her Honour stated that the test in s 1001D does not rely on a hypothetical reasonable person and does not require a material effect on the price of securities. However, in the circumstances of the case, her Honour held it was unnecessary to determine whether the differences are capable of producing different outcomes, because the concession of the parties that the price of shares in the relevant company were determined by the conduct and motivations of share traders would apply to both tests and the outcome would have been the same. On 31 July 2009, the High Court refused application for special leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision. In my opinion, in substance, the approach adopted by the majority is correct. It is a matter of the proper construction of Listing Rule 3.1. I would construe \"information\" which \"would, or would be likely to influence\" common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of securities as information, for the purposes of Listing Rule 3.1, that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of the securities. This is merely an approach to the construction of the words \"material effect on the price or value of the entity's securities\" in Listing Rule 3.1 which provides harmony with the provisions of ss 674 and 677 of the Act. Paragraph 20 of Guidance Note 8 to Listing Rule 3.1, which refers to s 674 and s 677, supports this construction. PART 8: CONTINUOUS DISCLOSURE: THE FOUR REQUIREMENTS The relevant requirements of Listing Rule 3.1 and s 674(2)(c), as applicable to FMG at the time it made the notifications to the ASX in August and November 2004 were as follows: (a) there must have existed \"information\" within the meaning of Listing Rule 3.1 and s 674(2); (b) FMG must have been aware of that information: s 674(2)(b), Listing Rule 3.1; (c) that information must not have been generally available: s 674(2)(c)(i), cf Listing Rule 3.1A.1; and (d) a reasonable person would have expected that information to have had a material effect on the price or value of FMG's shares, if it had been generally available: s 674(2)(c)(ii), Listing Rule 3.1. The meaning and operation of the last two requirements is governed by ss 676 and s 677 respectively. I will now deal with each of these requirements in turn. 8.1: INFORMATION Each of the CREC Information, CHEC Information and CMCC Information was mutatis mutandis in the same terms. Illustratively, the CREC Information, as pleaded at ASC [136] consists of the following information: (1) the fact of the signing of the CREC Framework Agreement on or about 6 August 2004 (2) the fact of the approval of the agreement by the boards of CREC and FMG by 19 August 2004 (3) some of the terms of the agreement selected by ASIC and set out in ASC [19], namely clauses: 1.1: the matters to be jointly developed and agreed, including \"a General Conditions of Contract suitable for a Build and Transfer type contract in good faith\" 2.1: items included in the \"Works\", the Works having earlier been defined in Recital A as the Build and Transfer of the railway 2.2: details of engineering, procurement and construction that would be included in the \"Agreement\" 3.1: the matters that would be included in the General Conditions of Contract (a document to be executed subsequently) 5: that the agreement would become binding on approval by the boards of directors of FMG and CREC 7: that the framework agreement represented an agreement in itself and that it was recognised that a fuller and more detailed agreement not different intent from the framework agreement would be developed later. (4) the legal effect of the framework agreement as pleaded at ASC [20]: (a) it did not by its terms oblige CREC to build or transfer a railway facility; (b) it did not by its terms oblige CREC to finance the construction of a railway facility; (c) CREC and the First Defendant agreed to develop and, at some later time, negotiate and then agree the matters contained in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement, and then to later enter into a full and detailed build and transfer agreement for a railway facility; (d) if the parties did not in fact agree on the matters contained in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement, then there would be no binding agreement to build and transfer a railway facility; and (e) if the parties were able to reach agreement on the matters contained in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement, the 'General Conditions' (referred to in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement) would include the terms set out in clause 3.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement. ASIC's selection of text from the CREC Framework Agreement to be included in the CREC Information was partial. It did not include the Recitals to the agreement, which disclosed that CREC, after closely examining all proposed documents had submitted an offer to build the railway which FMG had accepted and that it was this agreement which the parties wished to evidence. Nor did it include the following clauses: (1) cl 1.2, dealing with technical peer review and independent review of the schedule and value of the Works: Recital A; (2) cl 4, dealing with the scheduling of the Project and which included the target delivery date of last quarter 2006 for the first shipment of ore; and (3) cl 6, dealing with the application of relevant Australian and Chinese laws and regulations to the agreement. ASIC, in its written submissions submitted in paraphrase, in effect , that the \"information\" which existed, to the knowledge of FMG, for the purposes of s 674(2)(b) of the Act and which FMG ought to have disclosed was the material terms and the legal effect of the framework agreements expressed in the following way. (a) each of the framework agreements, if they had any effect at all, only required the parties to develop and agree the general conditions of contract suitable for building and transferring the relevant infrastructure, the scope of works, proposed sub-contractors and joint venture parties and security arrangements; (b) the framework agreements did not actually oblige the Chinese counterparties to build, transfer or finance the relevant infrastructure, and if the parties failed to develop and agree suitable terms then there would be no binding agreements to build and transfer the project infrastructure; I do not think that what is set out under the first part of (b), namely what the legal effect of the agreement was not, constitutes information, relevantly, for the purposes of s 674. What is required to be disclosed, in my opinion, is the fact of the agreements and what was their legal effect in substance. I also doubt whether the second part of (b) constitutes such information. However because of the view that I have come to as to whether any of this information ought to have been disclosed it is not necessary to resolve this doubt. This information when applied mutatis mutandis to each of the framework agreements is pleaded as \"the CREC Information\", \"the CHEC Information\" and \"the CMCC Information\". I have adopted Forrest's case specific collective description of these as \"Informations\". It was not suggested by ASIC that compliance, with its disclosure obligations, in such circumstances, required FMG to provide the ASX with a copy of the framework agreements, merely their material terms and legal effect. Although not pleaded this way by ASIC, the Information in each case in so far as it includes the material terms and legal effect of the framework agreements is the expression of an opinion. As ASIC implicitly submits its opinion as to the substance of the legal effect of the framework agreements is unarguably and obviously correct. Ultimately ASIC submits that the content of the Informations which was of primary significance was that: (a) the terms or legal effect of the framework agreements only required the Chinese parties to jointly develop and agree the terms of relevant build and transfer agreements; (b) the terms or legal effect of the framework agreements did not allocate risk of constructing the necessary infrastructure to the Chinese parties. What is set out at (a) is capable of constituting \"information\" for the purposes of s 674 and the Listing Rules but, again, I doubt, in the circumstances of this case, that what is set out under (b) is so capable. These written submissions ignore ASIC's alternative characterisation of the framework agreements as having no binding effect. I nonetheless deal with this issue in these reasons. ASIC submits that whether information exists within Listing Rule 3.1 and s 674(2), is an objective question. Further, ASIC submits that this does not depend upon the company's perception of the information, otherwise, idiosyncratic and unreasonable notions as to the effect of information would prevent the market being kept fully informed. It is irrelevant, ASIC says, to the existence of such information whether FMG believed that the framework agreements obliged the Chinese Contractors to build and transfer the relevant pieces of infrastructure, even if there were matters yet to be agreed. I do not agree. Where \"information\" is constituted by or includes the expression of an opinion, then the belief, or opinion, of the disclosing entity is, in my view, relevant. The question will be whether the particular opinion was reasonably and, in some circumstances, also honestly held. I do not accept ASIC's submission that, in this case, a consideration of FMG's belief would mark a return to questions of intentionality, which were removed from the continuous disclosure provisions upon the introduction of Ch 6CA: ASIC v Southcorp 130 FCR at 408-411, particularly at 409. I conclude that each of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information which is a combination of fact and opinion is information for the purposes of s 674(2) of the Act. 8.2: AWARENESS OF INFORMATION The first task for a company in contemplating its obligations under s 674(2) of the Act is to identify the relevant \"information\". This is a concept of very broad import. Here the information in each case included both fact and opinion. Even if FMG's disclosures as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements be characterised as assertions of fact they were assertions necessarily underpinned by an opinion. FMG necessarily was required to exercise judgment in the formation of that opinion. The disclosures conveyed that the effect of each framework agreement was a binding agreement for each Chinese Contractor to carry out and complete the build, finance and transfer of the relevant Project infrastructure. ASIC's case however is, despite what was stated in the disclosures as to the effect of the agreements, that FMG knew or at the least ought to have known of the Informations concerning the effect and operation of the framework agreements having regard to the plain terms of the agreements, their brevity, lack of essential terms and genesis. This reflects in each case a very different characterisation of the legal effect of the framework agreements to that contained in the disclosures. The Informations, in this respect, are to the effect that the framework agreements were either not legally binding upon the parties, or if they were, bound the parties only to negotiate and conclude agreements to build, transfer and finance the respective Project infrastructure. ASIC contends further that once the notifications of August and November had been made, FMG became aware of further information. This was information to the effect that these notifications already made were misleading and inaccurate because they did not properly state the effect and operation of the framework agreements. Listing Rule 3.1 requires an entity to be \"aware\" of information before it is obliged to notify the ASX of this information. The notion of awareness in Listing Rule 3.1 is extended to constructive awareness by the definition of \"aware\" in Listing Rule 19.12. An entity is treated as being aware of information if a director or executive officer has, or ought reasonably to have, come into possession of the information in the course of performing their duties. ASIC's primary case is that FMG through Forrest actually knew of the Informations, this information being self-evident from the terms of each framework agreement to those executive officers and board members who read them. This raises the question of whether Forrest honestly held the opinion necessarily underpinning the disclosures as to the legal effect of the framework agreements. ASIC also alleges that FMG executives, including Forrest, knew or reasonably ought to have known from their position and experience as executives or board members that a binding agreement obliging CREC, CHEC and CMCC to build and finance the railway, port and mine could not exist where the parties had not actually agreed on the following matters as set out in clause 1.1 of the CREC and CMCC Framework Agreements and clause 1.2 of the CHEC Framework Agreement. General Conditions of Contract suitable for a Build and Transfer type contract in good faith the scope of work to be included in the contract a list of nominated Australian and Chinese joint venture partners and/or subcontractors definitive engineering design (to Australian Standards) scheduling of the 'Works' determination of the value of the Works. The question then is whether Forrest and/or other directors and executive officers of FMG possessed or \"ought reasonably \" to have come into the possession of the alternative opinions as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements postulated by ASIC. As to the former, there is no evidence that FMG by its directors ever \"possessed\" the opinions as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements propounded by ASIC. As to the latter, ASIC's case is that the legal effect of the framework agreements accords with what is in the Informations, a conclusion which it says is self-evident and obvious simply from a consideration of the terms of each framework agreement. I will first consider this argument. ASIC also contends that FMG ought to have obtained competent legal advice and that if it had it could not reasonably have made the disclosures it did. It did not seek to prove, by expert legal opinion evidence that such competent advice would have matched its own opinions. I will deal with this latter claim by ASIC as part of my consideration of the related question whether FMG, by its board, actually held the opinion, in effect, contained in the disclosures and if it did, whether it was reasonable for it to hold that opinion. If such an opinion was in fact honestly and reasonably held by FMG's directors including Forrest, and who held no other opinion, then it could not be said that Forrest and/or other directors \"ought reasonably\" to have come into possession of the markedly different opinion postulated by ASIC. Accordingly, the question for resolution is not whether each of the framework agreements actually has the meaning and legal effect contended for by ASIC set out in the Informations in each case, but rather whether, in effect, ASIC's opinion as to their meaning and legal effect is the only reasonable opinion which could and should have been attributed to the framework agreements by FMG's directors, particularly Forrest, at the time its notifications were made to the ASX. If FMG, through Forrest, reasonably and honestly held the opinion that each framework agreement was an enforceable agreement to build, transfer and finance the relevant Project infrastructure then, in my view, it cannot be said that it had an obligation under s 674 to disclose the Informations which, to the extent that this contains matters of opinion as to the legal effect of the framework agreements, was the antithesis of its own opinion. If it were otherwise then, relevantly, a corporation and its directors could be liable to pecuniary penalties, and more, for contravention of s 674(2) on the basis of disclosures as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement, even although it was objectively reasonable to do so, but failing to disclose to the ASX \"information\" as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement based on another and different opinion which the corporation and relevant officers never held. I find support, in my approach to the issue of opinion, in the context of Listing Rule 3.1, from the judgment of McLure JA in Jubilee Mines 253 ALR 673. This case involved competing opinions as to the significance of geological information (the WMC information) supplied to Jubilee. Jubilee had obtained an expert opinion from a geologist, Mr Cooke, who was also an executive of Jubilee. In light of his opinion, Jubilee's managing director decided there was no need to disclose the information to the ASX. The respondent's expert opinion given at trial was to the contrary. McLure JA observed at [160] that expert opinions held in good faith on reasonable grounds may differ. Her Honour also stated at [185]: However, the fact that there are competing expert opinions on the level of significance of the WMC information does not justify a conclusion that the appellant ought to have been aware that the WMC information was highly significant. No doubt if Mr Cooke's assessment was negligent (not based on reasonable grounds) there may be room for such a finding. However, I see no basis in the evidence for a finding that Mr Cooke's opinion was other than honestly held on reasonable grounds. Subsequent drilling results do not support a finding that Mr Cooke's 1994 assessment was unreasonable. Were ASIC's opinions as to the legal effect of the framework agreements self evident having regard to their terms? ASIC's case is that the opinions, in effect, expressed in the Informations were obvious and the only opinions reasonably open objectively. I say opinions, because even on ASIC's case there are competing opinions. First ASIC submits that the framework agreements have no legal effect and are therefore unenforceable. Second ASIC submits that if they are enforceable they are merely agreements to enter into negotiations. It follows that ASIC's contention necessarily extends to a submission that FMG's opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreement, in effect contained in the disclosures opinion was not reasonably open. ASIC's submits that each framework agreement is obviously and self-evidently, upon a mere reading of the terms of cl 1 in each framework agreement, at most a binding agreement to negotiate. I do not accept this. The agreements in each case require to be considered as a whole. The resolution, were it necessary, of the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements, upon a consideration of their text, is neither straightforward nor, in my opinion, upon the analysis which follows, obvious. For example, were a court to embark upon such a task it would undoubtedly be informed by extrinsic material, such as, in the case of the CREC Framework Agreement \"all (the) proposed documents\" examined by CREC before submitting its offer to FMG to carry out and complete the Build and Transfer of the railway (Recital B). These documents may well, for example, have been capable of ascertaining to a sufficient degree the \"Works\" to be performed. Indeed, CREC performed a due diligence of the Project prior to the execution of the framework agreements and which is acknowledged in Recital B of the framework agreements. This occurred during a visit by representatives to Perth between 2 and 6 August 2004, including a detailed presentation on the Project by FMG executives, a presentation by Worley Parsons representatives and a site visit to Port Hedland. CREC was given access to many FMG documents. As I said earlier, it is not the Court's task, in this case, to decide what actually is the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. This is not an action on the agreements. The issue is whether FMG actually held or ought to have held the opinions propounded by ASIC as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements and to have informed the ASX accordingly. It also involves, in turn, whether the opinions in effect contained in the disclosures to the ASX were not capable of being reasonably held. I have concluded, for reasons which I explain later in this Part that, in the case of each of the framework agreements, there was an intention to contract. This, as a starting point considerably strengthens the case for the defendants because in such circumstances a Court will always strive to give effect to that intention: Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd [1932] UKHL 2 ; [1932] All ER Rep 494 ; York Air Conditioning and Refrigeration (A/sia) Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1949] HCA 23 ; (1949) 80 CLR 11 ; G R Securities 40 NSWLR 631; Fletcher Challenge Energy [2002] NZLR 433 . ASIC cites the recent decision in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199. It submits that the information about the Deed of Covenant and Indemnity which formed the basis of ASIC's claim against James Hardie Industries Limited made under the predecessor section to s 674 was information about the significance and effect of that Deed: at [484], as to which the defendants were too emphatic in understating the effect of this information in market releases. Yet what occurred there was the complete failure by the company to disclose the existence of certain covenants, an indemnity and the obligation to make certain payments. It was not a case, such as the present, involving, in effect, differing opinions as to the meaning and effect of agreements as a whole. I do not find it, in that respect, to be of any assistance. I will then, against this background, consider whether the only reasonable opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of each framework agreement is as expressed in the Informations or whether the opinion of FMG that each was an enforceable agreement to build, transfer and finance the relevant Project infrastructure was reasonably held. It is accepted that, in substance, each framework agreement is mutatis mutandis to the same effect. I will consider then the CREC Framework Agreement. However my conclusions will apply to all three framework agreements. ASIC submits that, on a plain reading of the agreement, clauses 2-7 are subject to clause 1 which purports to set out the \"framework\" the parties had agreed to in relation to jointly developing and agreeing on matters. ASIC says the absence of agreement and attendant lack of certainty in respect to the terms foreshadowed by clause 1 is not in any way altered by the later clauses. Clause 1.1 provides that the parties will jointly develop and agree on identified components for a Build and Transfer type contract, namely, a detailed engineering contract of a kind well known in the international construction industry. The components, ASIC says, are no more than broad headings. The reference to \"good faith\" only applies to the development and agreement of \"General Conditions of Contract suitable for a Build and Transfer type contract\". ASIC says discussions relating to each heading category are not confined or bounded by the later clauses, as they only require certain matters to be included if the parties can otherwise agree. The parties, ASIC says, are totally at large in their negotiation of the value of the works, and much the same applies to design details and specifications, the definition of the scope of the works, the identification of supplies and subcontractor performance specifications for commissioning, ramp-up and transfer and scheduling. The notion that the later clauses impose real constraints on the parties is, according to ASIC, illusionary. For example, it says, clause 1.2 of the agreement does not define the \"Scope of Works\", and clause 2.2 provides no more than broad matters to be included in a \"Scope of Works\" if that scope was to be agreed. It may be seen already that ASIC has brought a considerable degree of legal sophistication to its analysis. It is not the kind of analysis that would be self-evident to lay people. FMG submits that the agreement was a binding first agreement that was intended to have immediate legal effect. It was made at a time when a number of matters were still in the process of development, particularly the DFS but, despite that, it was an agreement under which: (a) CREC agreed to build and transfer the railway on the basis that FMG had to pay 10% of the value of the works before completion, such that CREC had agreed to take the financial risks involved, in return for security over the resources; (b) the parties agreed that there would be a more fulsome agreement in addition to, or in substitution for, the first agreement but such fulsome agreement would not detract from the binding nature of the CREC framework agreement, nor be different in intent. Further, FMG says, even though the value of the works and price were not agreed, because independent technical reviews were contemplated and because principles of reasonableness inform the position, the authorities demonstrate that those matters are not impediments to the binding nature of what was agreed. Forrest submits that the agreement falls under the first category of agreement identified in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 such that the parties have agreed all terms and intend to be bound immediately but propose 'to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect'. Like FMG, Forrest submits that the agreement was a binding first agreement for the build, finance and transfer of the railway, with a further agreement to be executed at a later date. ASIC submits, however, that the most noteworthy aspect of the agreement is the absence of agreement on critical matters, and the complete absence of detail about other matters. ASIC makes the following submissions regarding the terms of the CREC Framework Agreement in support of its contentions that the agreement was a bare agreement to negotiate the scope and terms of a further contract to build, transfer and finance the infrastructure, and that it did not impose any legally enforceable obligations: (a) CREC was not obliged to actually build or transfer the railway; (b) there was no agreed price in the agreement nor any mechanism to achieve or confirm a price; (c) there was no definition of the scope of the works to be performed; (d) there was no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials; (e) there was no definition of \"practical completion\"; (f) there were no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure. I will deal with each of these in turn. Was CREC arguably obliged to actually build or transfer the railway? FMG makes the following submission which I accept as a correct statement of the law. The proper construction of an agreement should be determined by what reasonable people in the position of the parties would have understood by the relevant clauses by considering not only their text, but also the surrounding circumstances and the purpose and object of the transaction: e.g. Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] ; International Air Transport Association v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd [2008] HCA 3 ; (2008) 234 CLR 151 at [8] and [53]. The whole of the document should be considered and its provisions given harmonious effect: Australian Broadcasting Commission v Australasian Performing Right Association Ltd [1973] HCA 36 ; (1973) 129 CLR 99 at 109 (Gibbs J, in dissent, but not on the applicable principle). Recital A makes plain that CREC had represented that it was able to complete the \"Build and Transfer\" of the railway Works, and Recital B makes plain that it had offered to do those Works. FMG had accepted that offer, and the parties wished to evidence their agreement. FMG says these recitals have all the hallmarks of an intention to contract for the build, transfer and financing of each component of the Project infrastructure. Authority supports an argument that the agreement recorded in the recitals for CREC to build or \"execute\" the railway should be given effect and should be treated as an agreement between FMG and CREC even where the operative provisions of the framework agreement do not contain such a provision and there is nothing inconsistent with such a construction in the operative provisions: Buckland v Buckland [1900] 2 Ch 534 at 540.3; MacKenzie v Childers (1889) 43 Ch D 265 at 274.7, 275.4-276.1; Ex parte Dawes; in re Moon (1886) 17 QBD 275 , 286.8, 288.2, 289.7; Aspdin v Austin (1844) 5 QB 671 at 683. This is even more so where, as here, the framework agreements were not drawn by lawyers. They were drafted by Heyting, an engineer, who also holds a Masters of Business Administration and who had some training in contract management. In those circumstances, arguably, a distinction between recitals and operational clauses should not be rigorously applied in an attempt to determine the parties' intention, determined objectively. Expressly, the recitals proceed on the basis that there is an agreement for the relevant Chinese contractor to build the infrastructure which is sought to be recorded in the framework agreements. The recitals do not say or imply that what follows is merely an informal arrangement, or a mere agreement to negotiate. In Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth of Australia [1977] HCA 71 ; (1977) 139 CLR 54 at 72.7, Mason J said: No doubt it is correct to say that, where in the recitals to a deed or an agreement it is acknowledged that the parties have agreed to do, or will do, certain acts, a promise to do those acts will be read into the agreement in the absence of an express promise to that effect. Then, there being no indication of a contrary intention, it may safely be inferred that the absence of a contractual provision was due to oversight or inadvertence. It can be seen from the recitals that FMG accepted CREC's offer to \"execute the Works\", namely the \"Build and Transfer\" of the railway. Applying Mason J's proposition in Ansett Transport Industries [1977] HCA 71 ; 139 CLR 54 , CREC's promise to build and transfer the railway may, arguably, be read into the operational part of the agreement, there being no indication of a contrary intention. Accordingly, in my view, it is arguable and reasonably so that the Recitals of the agreement record the parameters of the intended agreement, that is, the offer and acceptance of the obligation to build and transfer the railway. Clause 1.1 arguably does not derogate from this obligation. This clause lists the matters which would be the subject of further development and agreement including definitive engineering design to Australian standards. Arguably this is a reference to the definitive feasibility study process which the parties knew had to be completed in order for details of their agreement to be worked out and in particular would define the scope of the Works, the scheduling of the Works and the cost of the Works. Clause 7 provides that: This document represents an agreement in itself and it is recognised a fuller and more detailed agreement not different in intent from this agreement will be developed later. It seems clear enough that this further detailed agreement is one for the build and transfer of the railway. It would make no commercial sense for it to be merely a more detailed agreement to negotiate. The \"intent\" referred to, which the parties considered was revealed within the terms of the framework agreement must, it seems to me, be the intent that CREC build and transfer the railway. At least there is a very respectable argument that this was what the parties were seeking to achieve. Recitals A and B support such a construction. The price issue There is authority for the proposition that merely because price is not specified in an agreement it does not follow that the agreement is not binding. It is always a question of properly construing the particular agreement. In Foley v Classique Coaches Limited [1934] 2 KB 1 , the sale of land under a written contract was subject to the buyer entering into a supplemental agreement to purchase petrol and/or oil from the seller, the terms of which had been agreed between them. The supplemental agreement stated that petrol would be purchased \"at a price to be agreed by the parties in writing and from time to time\", and provided for arbitration in the event of any dispute or difference arising on the subject matter or construction of the agreement. Scrutton LJ agreed at p 10 that there was an effective and enforceable contract, although as to the future no definite price had been agreed with regard to the petrol. Greer LJ held at p 12 that it was appropriate to imply a term in the contract that the price of the petrol supplied shall be reasonable and in no way inconsistent with the agreement. Maugham LJ held that the contract was enforceable, inter alia, because implied in the obligation to sell and purchase the petrol at an agreed price was words to the effect that, in the absence of agreement, the arbitration clause provided a means for the determination of a reasonable price for the petrol. Godecke v Kirwan [1973] HCA 38 ; (1973) 129 CLR 629 involved an agreement for the sale of land which contained a provision that, if required, a further agreement would be executed containing the agreed terms and such other terms as the seller's solicitors may 'reasonably require'. Despite this provision, it was held that there was a binding contract. Walsh J, with whom Mason J agreed, stated at 642: ' It is clearly established that a binding agreement may be made which leaves some important matter, e.g. the price, to be settled by the decision of a third party'. Gibbs J concurred but cast the principles slightly more narrowly in some respects (646-8). He stated at 648 that the fact that the further agreement contemplated in the case before him would contain additional covenants and conditions if the vendor's solicitors reasonably required them did not mean that the parties had not reached complete agreement. This case was decided after Hall v Busst (1960) 104 CLR 207, an authority relied on by ASIC . In Pagnan SpA v Feed Products Ltd [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 601 the English Court of Appeal held that a binding contract had been made in circumstances where no price, quantity, delivery date, loading rate, rate of demurrage and despatch or date of commencement in regard to the sale of corn gluten feed pellets had been agreed in an exchange of telexes between the parties. The fact that the terms yet to be agreed were of economic significance did not prevent a contract being binding if that was what the parties intended. Further, the fact that the parties continued to negotiate after the first agreement had been entered had no effect on whether the agreements were binding because ' ...it was only to be expected that they would continue negotiating the terms that remained without delay' (at 620.8). Lloyd LJ's listing of the principles to be derived from the authorities included at 619.1 that: ...the parties may intend to be bound forthwith even though there are further terms still to be agreed or some further formality to be fulfilled'. Lloyd LJ also stated at 619.5: It is sometimes said that the parties must agree on the essential terms and that it is only matters of detail which can be left over. This may be misleading, since the word \"essential\" in that context is ambiguous. If by \"essential\" one means a term without which the contract cannot be enforced then the statement is true: the law cannot enforce an incomplete contract. If by \"essential\" one means a term which the parties have agreed to be essential for the formation of a binding contract, then the statement is tautologous. If by \"essential\" one means only a term which the Court regards as important as opposed to a term which the Court regards as less important or a matter of detail, the statement is untrue. It is for the parties to decide whether they wish to be bound and, if so, by what terms, whether important or unimportant. It is the parties who are, in the memorable phrase coined by the Judge, \"the masters of their contractual fate\". Of course the more important the term is the less likely it is that the parties will have left it for future decision. But there is no legal obstacle which stands in the way of parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. It happens everyday when parties enter into so called 'heads of agreement'. (Emphasis added). ASIC submits in written closing submission that the authorities such as Anaconda, Pagnan SpA, Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games Ltd (1988) 18 NSWLR 540 and Uranium Equities v Fewster [2008] WASCA 33 ; (2008) 36 WAR 97 relied on by FMG state that whether or not the parties intended to contract, they must agree on such terms, normally described as essential terms, such that the contract could be enforced or made complete by implying terms or applying considerations of reasonableness. I will consider these authorities further. In Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 , the Court of Appeal found that a binding contract had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed, the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement \"constituted an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form\". At [28], Ipp J referred to the following statement by Sugerman J, approved by Menzies J in Thorby v Goldberg [1964] HCA 41 ; (1964) 112 CLR 597 at 607: It is a first principle of the law of contracts that there can be no binding and enforceable obligation unless the terms of the bargain, or at least its essential and critical terms, have been agreed upon. So, there is no concluded contract where an essential or critical term is expressly left to be settled by future agreement of the parties. Again, there is no binding contract where the language used is so obscure and incapable of any precise or definite meaning that the court is unable to attribute to the parties any particular contractual intentions. But at [29] Ipp J also referred to the statement of Lloyd LJ in Pagnan SpA [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 601 that I have extracted above, where his Lordship emphasised that that the meaning of 'essential' in the context of agreeing upon essential terms was ambiguous and that there was no legal obstacle standing in the way of the parties agreeing to be bound now while deferring important matters to be agreed later. In Uranium Equities [2008] WASCA 33 ; 36 WAR 97 , a recent judgment of the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Court of Appeal), the Court stated at [127]: There is some overlap between the requirements of intention to create legal relations and certainty. If a contract is legally uncertain, this might indicate that the parties did not intend to create legal relations. A contract can be uncertain in various ways, one of these being incompleteness, in the sense that essential terms are lacking: Thorby v Goldberg [1964] HCA 41 ; (1964) 112 CLR 597 , 603 (Kitto J); Godecke v Kirwan [1973] HCA 38 ; (1973) 129 CLR 629 , 646 - 647 (Gibbs J). The overlap between intention and uncertainty is at its greatest in cases in which agreement on some matters is deliberately postponed. If what is postponed is essential to the agreement (itself a question that largely depends upon the intention of the parties) , the agreement, to the extent that it has been reached, will be void. Also, the fact that essential terms have been left over for later agreement will militate against a finding that the parties intended to create contractual relations. (Emphasis added) In Uranium Equities [2008] WASCA 33 ; 36 WAR 97 , the parties to the putative agreement had been negotiating over a proposed mining joint venture, but no heads of agreement had been executed. The Court found that the trial judge was right in concluding that the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed. The Court went on to state on the question of uncertainty at [257] that it is \"trite\" that, even when the requisite intention is present, a contract can fail for uncertainty. The Court said it is also trite that only the omission of an essential term will have the effect that a contract is so incomplete or uncertain as to render it invalid, citing Ipp J in Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 at [29] . The Court referred to the statement of Lloyd LJ from Pagnan SpA [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep at 619 and found that when regard was had to all the circumstances the parties did not intend to be bound by anything said or done by them until such time as the heads of agreement had been executed . The Court concluded that although some of the matters left over by the parties for future negotiation were important, none were essential to the efficacy of the alleged agreement in the sense that the agreement could not be enforced without it. In Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games 18 NSWLR 540 Gleeson CJ, with whom Hope and Mahoney JJA agreed, confirmed at 584E-F the importance in a Masters v Cameron type of dispute of assessing the parties' intention to make a concluded bargain, and stated that the question of intention is distinct from, although it may be closely related to, the question whether the parties have reached agreement upon such terms as are, in the circumstances, legally necessary to constitute a contract. His Honour stated: Nevertheless, in the ordinary case, as a matter of fact and commonsense, other things being equal, the more numerous and significant the areas in respect of which the parties have failed to reach agreement, the slower a court will be to conclude that they had the requisite contractual intention. Gleeson CJ stated at 549 that it was not a case where the parties to the purported contract had signed a single document which, because it contained some expression as \"subject to contract\", gave rise to the problem in question. His Honour found there was no intention to make a concluded bargain, 551. The communications relied upon as constituting a contract, construed with regard to the subject matter of the negotiations and the surrounding circumstances, and in the light of subsequent communications between the parties, did not appear to evidence to his Honour an intention to make a concluded bargain. What the authorities demonstrate is that even when important matters that may be described as 'essential', including price, are left over for future negotiation, agreements may be enforced by the courts upon satisfaction of contractual intention. The present case involves admitted contractual intention and the construction of an agreement which on its face has arguably made provision for price in a manner that is certain and legally enforceable. I will now turn to the cases cited by ASIC in support of its submission that the framework agreements were unenforceable because they were uncertain due to a lack of essential terms such as price: Hall v Busst 104 CLR 207; Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd v Ken Morgan Motors Pty Ltd (1994) 2 VR 106 at 168-177 per Tadgell J; Faulkner v Thomas [2000] TASSC 159 at [34] ; and Southern Cross Financial Group (Newcastle) Pty Ltd v Rodrigues (2005) 66 IPR 166 at [36], [44]. The judgment of the High Court in Hall v Busst 104 CLR 207, illustrates how judges have disagreed as to the enforceability of a contractual clause dealing with the issue of price, where the clause leaves an aspect of the price for determination at a later time. This judgment is in relative terms an old decision, but the High Court was divided 3-2 which underscores the difficulty in construing such clauses and in a case such as the present case the unfairness which would attach to fixing on one opinion over others where those others were reasonably based and honestly held. The dispute involved a contract of sale in relation to an island off the coast of Queensland. The contract included an indenture which included an option which was in effect (in the words of Dixon CJ at 212) an option for the buyer of the land to take the land back with a refund of the sale price payment for the additions and improvements at their value less deficiences and depreciation. The clause referred to \"the value of all additions and improvements to the said property\" and \"the value of all deficiences of chattel property and a reasonable sum to cover depreciation of all buildings and other property\". The appeal to the High Court was brought on the ground that the price payable on the exercise of the option under the indenture was prescribed or expressed in terms which left it uncertain so that the option was unenforceable. Dixon CJ held at 217 that the price described in the relevant clause was unascertained and was too uncertain to be the basis of an enforceable contract. His Honour said: There could be no external standard of value of additions and improvements to the island: no standard yielding a figure reasonable fixed or ascertainable. Still less would it be possible to find an external standard for the reasonable sum to cover depreciation even if one knew what 'other property' is referred to. Fullagar J also held that the clause was uncertain because the price was not fixed with certainty. However, his Honour stated (222) that it would be sufficient if the sale was expressed to be for a price or value to be fixed by a named or described person. It was not sufficient for the sale to be expressed to be \"for the value of the land\" or \"for the fair value of the land\" or \"for a reasonable price\". Menzies J took a similar view, stating that no means of authoritative determination was provided by the agreement, and the necessity for further agreement revealed that there was no binding contract (231). Kitto J dissented stating that the meaning of the clause providing for additions and subtractions to the price did not seem to be uncertain, and that the value of the additions, improvements and deficiencies were capable of being ascertained when the time arrived. The provision as to \"a reasonable sum to cover depreciation\" appeared to his Honour to be definite in meaning and capable of being rendered certain in application, and he referred to a number of authorities. Windeyer J also dissented, saying that the parties expressed their intention in language that was sufficiently certain to create legal obligations. His Honour stated, following reference to a range of authorities (245): When parties agree to sell for a reasonable price or at a fair valuation they do not leave an essential term of their bargain for further agreement, so that their agreement is incomplete. It is complete. They have fixed the price by a measure that the law knows. If they disagree as to what sum of money fills that measure, a court will determine it, at common law by a jury. Toyota Motor Corporation 2 VR 106, a judgment of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of Victoria concerned the enforceability of a purported agreement set out in a letter for two Toyota companies to rescue a motor vehicle dealer group of companies that was in financial trouble. The purported agreement contained 12 conditions relating to the rescue offer. Brooking J referred to many examples in the purported agreement of ambiguity, uncertainty and incompleteness. Tadgell J held that the Toyota companies did not send the letter to the dealer group as an offer, and accordingly, they could not have assented to it as embodying the terms of a contract. Furthermore, as Brooking J stated at 132: Each case is different. A relatively short letter may be held to record a binding agreement in a matter of great consequence and considerable complexity, in which numerous formal documents will have to be prepared and executed to give effect to the transaction, as in Custom Credit Corporation Ltd v Cenepro Pty Ltd (unreported, Court of Appeal of New South Wales, 7 August 1991). I respectfully agree with Brooking J. The brevity of the framework agreements does not of itself point to those agreements as lacking legal effect in circumstances where the agreements expressly referred to the preparation of fuller and more detailed agreements not different in intent. Toyota Motor Corporation 2 VR 106, does not assist ASIC. Each member of the court in Toyota Motor Corporation 2 VR 106, concluded that there was no contractual intention evident: Brooking J at 136; Tadgell J at 177; JD Phillips J at 201. This, of itself, distinguishes this decision from the present case. It is correct that no price was specified in the CREC Framework Agreement, but it is explicit as to the pricing mechanism that was agreed to apply: FMG had to make a down payment of only 10% of the value of the Works in exchange for a bank guarantee from CREC, which bank guarantee was to be returned when 10% of the Works had been completed; and thereafter FMG's obligations of payment were to arise progressively after practical completion. This was an agreement on the pricing mechanism, which meant that FMG was not required to raise capital before the Works were effected, save for the first 10% of the value. It was not an agreement to agree but arguably rather an agreement as to what would be in the general conditions. Faulkner v Thomas [2000] TASSC 159 concerned a partnership agreement which included a clause containing an elaborate mechanism for the determination of the purchase price of the assets and goodwill of a deceased partner, with the price to be fixed by a valuer. Underwood J held at [34] that the rule imposed on the valuers for the ascertainment of the value of the goodwill was completely meaningless by virtue of the omission of a dollar figure from a particular subparagraph of the clause. Underwood J stated that the rule that had to be applied for the ascertainment of the value of the goodwill was incomplete in just the same way as if a contract specified that \"the purchase price of the goods sold is $____\". Accordingly, the uncertainty created by this omission rendered the whole contract void for uncertainty. Underwood J went on in that paragraph to state: \"It is not for the Court to supply the omission upon some notions of general fairness\" and cited Hall v Busst as authority for that proposition. In the present matter, my view is that the pricing mechanism in the framework agreements is arguably certain for reasons I will explain below. In Southern Cross Financial Group 66 IPR 166 , Young CJ in Eq stated at [36] that in a contract for the sale of any article there are at least three basic requirements: precise identification of the parties to the contract; the property to be sold; and the price at which it is to be sold. In connection with the price requirement, his Honour referred to the analysis of Fullagar J in Hall v Busst 104 CLR at 222, and stated at [44] that this analysis made it quite clear that with \"very, very, very few\" exceptions, a contract to sell property at fair value is not binding and is incomplete. The exceptions included 'an industry which has a measure of what a fair value is or there is some other criteria'. I would add that Fullagar J stated at 222 that it would be sufficient if the sale was expressed to be for a price or value to be fixed by a named or described person. The CREC Framework Agreement did not simply state that the infrastructure items would be transferred at fair value or in like terms. Rather, the agreement expressly provided a pricing mechanism. Further, Southern Cross Financial Group 66 IPR 166 is distinguishable from the present matter because Young CJ found that the case was one where the parties intended there not to be a concluded contract unless and until a formal document had been executed . Arguably cl 3.1 of the CREC framework agreement builds on cl 1.1 and gives more detail to another of the itemised matters in cl 1.1 namely, the general conditions suitable for a build and transfer contract. Clause 3.1 also contains an agreement that FMG would provide security to CREC in the form of a JORC classified resource to the value of the Works. This arguably is not uncertain. It augments the agreed pricing mechanism. It was agreed that, save for 10% of the value, CREC was to fund the costs of the Works, and was to have security for that risk. I think it is arguable that the opening words of cl 3.1 that the \"Parties agree that the following will be included in the General Conditions of Contract\" contemplate a more fulsome agreement in substitution but one that does not destroy the nature of the contractual intention disclosed by the CREC Framework Agreement nor render it a non-binding agreement. The same may be said about the language in cl 2.2.1. Clause 3.1 refers to standard liquidated damages and performance bonds clauses and the need for CREC to issue bank guarantees for any warranty period. Agreement on these contemplated machinery provisions arguably was capable of ascertainment by applying standards of reasonableness or by the implication of terms. It was not possible for FMG to announce to the market a \"firm price\" until the completion of the DFS. In the August notification all that could be provided was the cost estimate for the Project infrastructure being $1.85 billion reduced to an estimated $1.7 billion in the 8 November Letter. I will refer to this letter in greater detail later. So much was evident from the terms of that letter on the question of price which, relevantly, stated: All three Chinese companies will be working with FMG and the Worley Group within the Definitive Feasibility Study process to establish a firm price which will then be incorporated into a fixed price contract with each party. The CREC Framework Agreement contemplates, at least arguably, that the price would equate to the \"value of the Works\". This is because payment by FMG to CREC was initially 10% of the \"value of the Works\" with subsequent percentages of the value of the Works together totalling 100% of the value of the Works (cl 3.1). The price would likely have been established in due course through the DFS process and settled by a third party. The value of the Works was to be subject to independent review (cl 1.2). It is arguable that once the scope of work was, in due course, established, that the value of the Works could be established, upon review, by reference to an appropriately qualified independent party such as Worley, upon considerations of reasonableness. Such an approach, arguably, is contemplated in the agreement. The \"Works\" are broadly defined in Recital A. The documents relevant to the Works and upon which the offer to execute the Works was made are referred to in Recital B. Accordingly it is reasonably arguable that, because independent reviews were contemplated, informed by principles of reasonableness, good faith and a mutual duty to co-operate, the authorities demonstrate that even the absence of an agreed price is not inevitably an impediment to the enforceability of the CREC Framework Agreement. The scope of work Again, reasonably arguably, the scope of work was well capable of being identified. The scope of the Works was a matter dealt with by clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement. This clause relevantly provides that the parties would 'jointly develop and agree ... the Scope of Work'. Consistent with their intention to be immediately bound to build and transfer the relevant Project infrastructure, the parties set out matters to be included in the scope of the Works in clause 2 of the Framework Agreements. Clause 2.1 builds on cl 1.1 and gives more detail to one of the itemised matters in cl 1.1 namely, the scope of work, providing a sufficiently general description of the Works to be carried out by CREC. The Works are further particularised in cl 2.2. In cl 2.2.1, CREC was responsible for design, project management, procurement, construction and commissioning of the works. FMG was able to effect the technical review of the Works, referring back to cl 1.2, so that, objectively, the price for the Works could be finalised. Accordingly whilst the final scope of work was to be determined in detail through the DFS, as confirmed by Heyting, insofar as it was possible at the date of execution and having regard to the review of FMG's documents by the Chinese Contractors (Recital B of the framework agreements), the parties had already reached agreement on the broad categories of Works that were required to be undertaken by the Chinese entities. Again the market knew by 9 November 2004 from the 8 November Letter that \"(a)s contemplated under the respective agreements entered into to date, the first stage of work covering design and engineering ...\" was yet to be performed. ASIC's other contentions ASIC also points to the absence of the following from the framework agreements: no provision for choice of contractors or the selection of materials; no definition of \"practical completion\"; and no specifications for any design elements of the infrastructure. The documents referred to in the Recitals to each agreement would have, no doubt, assisted in clarifying the matters absent from the agreements. In light of those documents, following the approach of Ipp J in Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 at [61] , it may have been possible to conclude that, despite the long list of matters said to render the framework agreements uncertain and incomplete, there was a binding contract, workable by implying terms or on the proper construction of the agreement. The court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms by reference to the implied duty to co-operate and use considerations of reasonableness, to give effect to that intention: Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games 18 NSWLR 540; Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd v Hebron Park Pty Ltd [2009] QCA 60. The asserted uncertainty or incompleteness may therefore be overcome once the requisite intention to contract is found to be present. As noted previously, this is not an action on the agreements, and the issue is whether FMG's opinions as to the legal effect of the framework agreements were not capable of being reasonably held. I am not satisfied that it is unequivocally correct to say that the absence of the abovementioned matters from the framework agreements necessarily renders the agreements uncertain or incomplete and that the asserted omissions could not have been filled by a court having regard to orthodox legal principles. I am satisfied that an objective assessment of the CREC Framework Agreement is reasonably capable of supporting an argument that it was intended to be an agreement binding CREC to build and finance and transfer the railway for FMG and was as FMG submits a first binding agreement contemplating a further detailed binding agreement having the same intent. The position is the same in respect of the other two framework agreements. As I have already mentioned , I do not consider it necessary to arrive at a determinative conclusion as to whether the framework agreements were actually binding agreements to build, finance and transfer. Reasonably arguably they were such. The parties thought that this was what they were. FMG had the legal oversight of Huston to ensure that at least in his professional opinion they were. They had the later confirmation of this from Huston in clear terms that they were such. Were it necessary, in those circumstances, and in this case I do not think it is, to have regard to the authorities, they demonstrate, in principle, that agreements of the kind under consideration may well be enforceable. I will now consider those authorities. Modern contract law ASIC relies upon the following authorities in support of its submission that the framework agreements are bare agreements to negotiate the scope and terms, in each case, of a further agreement to build transfer and finance the relevant Project infrastructure and that such agreements are not enforceable: Coal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 1 ; Jobern Pty Ltd v Breakfree Resorts (Victoria) Pty Ltd [2007] FCA 1066 ; Walford v Miles [1992] 2 AC 128. I will accordingly consider these and other authorities on the subject. However, it is important to emphasise that I am not being asked in this case to finally determine whether the framework agreements were legally enforceable as FMG described them in the disclosures. The authorities to that extent, merely expose matters of principle relevant to an objective assessment as to whether the opinions pressed by ASIC as to the legal effect of the agreements in this case are the only opinions reasonably open and conversely whether the opinion expressed in the disclosures could not reasonably have been held by FMG. Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1 concerned the enforceability of an agreement to negotiate a complex coal mining joint venture. The parties had agreed on a heads of agreement document for the proposed joint venture which included the statement: \"...The parties will forthwith proceed in good faith to consult together upon the formulation of a more comprehensive and detailed Joint Venture Agreement...\". The Court of Appeal (Kirby P, Handley JA and Waddell A-JA) held that the statement was not binding as a contractual promise. Kirby P, with whom Waddell A-JA agreed, held at p 27 that the promise, having regard to the context in which it was made, should be classified as too illusory or too vague and uncertain to be enforceable. Handley JA held at pp 42-43 that a promise to negotiate in good faith is illusory and therefore cannot be binding because there are no identifiable criteria by which the content of the obligation to negotiate in good faith can be determined. Kirby P did not state that an agreement to negotiate would never be enforceable. His Honour approved Lord Wright's speech in Hillas & Co Ltd v Arcos Ltd [1932] UKHL 2 ; [1932] All ER Rep 494 such that, provided there was consideration for the promise, in some circumstances a promise to negotiate in good faith will be enforceable, depending on its precise terms. The proper approach to be taken in each case depends on the construction of the particular contract. His Honour stated: \"In many contracts it will be plain that the promise to negotiate is intended to be a binding legal obligation to which the parties should then be held\". Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 involved a contractual dispute where the parties had executed a document entitled 'Heads of Agreement' (HofA), clause 3.3 of which stated: \"Each party will conduct all such negotiations in good faith to ensure that the terms set out in these Heads of Agreement are given full effect\". It was not in dispute in Jobern that the parties were bound by the HoFA, which Gordon J stated to be a final agreement within the first category described in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 at [106] . However Gordon J considered that cl 3.3 was uncertain because it suffered from the same problems referred to by Kirby J in Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1 at [130]. Walford v Miles [1992] 2 AC 128 was an appeal to the House of Lords. The parties had been negotiating over the sale of a business. Their Lordships considered the validity of a 'lock-out' agreement, an agreement committing the seller not to negotiate with anyone other than the buyer over the sale of the business. The plaintiffs, the disappointed buyers, claimed that not only were the sellers \"locked-out\" for some unspecified time from dealing with any third party, but were \"locked-in\" to dealing with the plaintiffs for an unspecified period. The court considered the \"lock-in\" agreement in terms of an obligation on the parties to negotiate in good faith. Lord Ackner (with whom all the other Law Lords agreed) stated that an agreement to negotiate, like an agreement to agree, is unenforceable, because it lacks the necessary certainty. Lord Ackner said at [138G]: A duty to negotiate in good faith is as unworkable in practice as it is inherently inconsistent with the position of a negotiating party. It is here that the uncertainty lies. In my judgment, while negotiations are in existence either party is entitled to withdraw from these negotiations, at any time and for any reason. There can be thus no obligation to continue to negotiate until there is a 'proper reason' to withdraw. Accordingly a bare agreement to negotiate has no legal content. In my view Coal Cliff Collieries 24 NSWLR 1, Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 and Walford [1992] 2 AC 128 do not assist ASIC. I do not take Coal Cliff Collieries as authority for the proposition that a bare agreement to negotiate in good faith is not enforceable, as submitted by ASIC. In my view, that case is authority for the proposition that a promise to negotiate in good faith may, in particular circumstances, be enforceable, depending on the precise terms as construed from the contract. In Jobern [2007] FCA 1066 , it was not in dispute that the heads of agreement document was binding --- only the negotiation clause was held to be uncertain. In Walford [1992] 2 AC 128 , the agreement that was found to be uncertain was a 'lock-in' agreement committing the parties to negotiate with each other, which is to be distinguished from the types of obligations found in the framework agreements under consideration in the present case. In Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 , Dixon CJ, McTiernan and Kitto JJ explained in a joint judgment that where parties who have been in negotiation reach agreement upon terms of a contractual nature and also agree that the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract, the case may belong to any of three classes, the first two involving binding contracts (360): (1) The parties have agreed all terms and intend to be bound immediately but at the same time propose 'to have the terms restated in a form which will be fuller or more precise but not different in effect'; (2) The parties have agreed all terms but intend to make performance of one or more terms conditional on the execution of a formal document; (3) The intention may be not to make a concluded bargain at all unless and until the parties execute a formal contract. The judgment went on to explain that the question depends upon the intention disclosed by the language the parties have employed (362.5) and that there is no formula, such as \"subject to contract\" which is so intractable as always and necessarily to produce a result that there is no binding contract (363.6). The courts have also recognised a fourth class of case additional to the three mentioned in Masters v Cameron [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353 , a class identified by Knox CJ, Rich J and Dixon J in Sinclair, Scott & Co Ltd v Naughton [1929] HCA 34 ; (1929) 43 CLR 310 at 317 as: ... one in which the parties were content to be bound immediately and exclusively by the terms which they had agreed upon whilst expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first contract, containing, by consent, additional terms. This fourth category was recognised by McLelland J in Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 622 and on appeal in G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 631 where McHugh JA delivered the Court of Appeal's judgment and observed that the magnitude, subject matter or complexities of a transaction may indicate that an agreement was a limited one not intended to have legal effect (634D) but that what was critical was the parties' intention objectively ascertained, and that this intention should prevail (634E-F). In Uranium Equities Ltd [2008] WASCA 33 ; 36 WAR 97 , the Supreme Court of Western Australia (Court of Appeal) stated at [129] that the fourth Masters v Cameron category was a variation of the first category. In Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 , the NSW Court of Appeal emphasised that determining whether parties have come to a concluded agreement is a matter of their objectively ascertained intention in the particular case. Giles JA stated that the Masters v Cameron categories and a possible fourth category are intellectual aids, and that categorisation does not greatly contribute to the decision in the particular case, which is concerned with finding what agreement, if any, the parties came to, [26]. Similarly, in Moffat Property Development Group Pty Ltd [2009] QCA 60 , Keane JA, with whom McMurdo P and Atkinson J agreed, said at [37] in relation to classifying the putative agreement in that case under one of the four Masters v Cameron categories: In my respectful opinion, however, there is little purpose to be served in seeking to resolve the issue of classification. A concern as to classification should not be allowed to obscure or distract from the real task of the court which is to ascertain and give effect to the intentions of the parties. Keane JA referred to Sir Anthony Mason's opening address to the Journal of Contract Law 20 th Anniversary Conference ((2009) 25 Journal of Contract Law 1, 6): ... [T]he categories (or classifications of Masters v Cameron ((1954) [1954] HCA 72 ; 91 CLR 353) , be they three or four, are no more than exemplifications of the general principle that, in the case of written documents, the intention of the parties is to be resolved objectively and as a matter of construction of the relevant documents. The categories are necessarily subject to the general principle. The question therefore, which is of paramount importance here is whether or not the parties to the framework agreements intended them, objectively, to be legally binding. In the same vein in Fletcher Challenge Energy Ltd v Electricity Corporation of New Zealand Ltd [2002] 2 NZLR 433 at 445, Blanchard J observed: The court has an entirely neutral approach when determining whether the parties intended to enter into a contract. Having decided that they had that intention, however, the Court's attitude will change. It will then do its best to give effect to their intention and, if at all possible, to uphold the contract despite any omissions or ambiguities. At 448, Blanchard J referred to the statement of the English Court of Appeal in Pagnan SpA v Feed Products [1987] 2 Lloyd's Rep 601: Merely because an important term is deferred to be settled on a future occasion that does not mean that there is no intention to be bound. Significantly, ASIC, by its senior counsel, correctly in my view, conceded that, as a matter of objective inference, the agreements were intended to be legally binding: T149.30-35. I would have arrived at this conclusion, absent this concession. Each framework agreement is expressed to be \"an agreement in itself\" and to become \"binding\" upon the approval of both boards. On 19 August a joint statement of the Boards of Directors signed in Beijing by Forrest as chairman for FMG and Mr Qin Jiaming, as chairman for CREC stated: As per Item 5-Approval of the Framework Agreement, Mr Qin Jiaming, Chairman of Board of Directors of CREC and Mr Andrew Forrest, Chairman of Board of Directors of FMG have reviewed the Framework Agreement and hereby approve that the Framework Agreement will become binding on the signing of this Statement. FMG's board had on 13 August 2004 resolved to ratify the CREC framework agreement and had authorised Forrest to execute the joint statement on behalf of FMG's board. I infer that Qin had a similar authority to act on behalf of CREC. The use of such expressions supports a finding of an intention to contract. In Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd 40 NSWLR 622 , McLelland J, in finding that by an exchange of letters the parties to an alleged agreement mutually communicated their respective assents to be legally bound by terms capable of having contractual effect, afforded the expression \"legally binding\" primacy despite the expression \"agreement in principle\" also found in the relevant agreement (628). His Honour thought that the case fell into the fourth category as recognised in Sinclair, Scott & Co [1929] HCA 34 ; 43 CLR 310 (629F) . The appeal from McLelland J's judgment G R Securities v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital 40 NSWLR 631 was dismissed. McHugh JA accepted in line with Sinclair, Scott & Co [1929] HCA 34 ; 43 CLR 310 , that it was possible for the parties to be bound immediately and agree to substitute for the first contract a further contract containing additional terms (634G). Further, McHugh JA applied the general rule applicable to every contract explained by Mason J in Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 607 that each party was obliged to do all that was necessary on his part to enable the other party to have the benefit of the contract. The present case is, if anything, stronger in this respect. There was an executed agreement between FMG and CREC, not just an exchange of letters. The question remains however, in respect of what, reasonably arguably, was the CREC Framework Agreement legally binding. In Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 , the issue was whether a binding contract for Anaconda, a company interested in lateritic nickel, to explore and mine for base metals on the tenements of Tarmoola, a company interested mainly in gold, had been made when a heads of agreement containing five clauses was signed, the last paragraph of which said that the heads of agreement ' constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form' . Tarmoola argued that there was no intention to contract, no agreement on essential terms, and that the agreement was incomplete and uncertain. By majority, the WA Full Court rejected these arguments and held that the heads of agreement was a binding contract. Ipp J (with whom Pidgeon J agreed) found that contractual intention was present. His Honour endorsed the existence of the fourth Masters v Cameron category in stating: It is well recognised that parties may enter into a valid contract containing a limited number of terms comprising those terms essential to the bargain that they wish to conclude, in the expectation that at a later date a further contract will be arrived at containing additional terms that would facilitate and clarify the initial contract. That is to say, a binding contract may be arrived at even though it leaves unresolved many matters which might arise in future. [25] His Honour found that the agreement was neither incomplete nor uncertain such as to render it void or such as to indicate that the parties did not intend to enter into legal relations, and that the agreement contained all the essential terms required for a legally binding agreement. The omission to deal with particular future problems such as water did not make the agreement uncertain or incomplete: these issues could be resolved by processes of construction and implication: [79]. His Honour stated that the parties' failure to enter into a more detailed agreement may have made the exploring and mining operations contemplated by the heads of agreement more expensive, difficult and complex, but he did not accept that it was unworkable in the sense of it being objectively impossible for performance of its terms to be effected: [95]. In dissent, Anderson J noted that the trial judge had found this case to be in the third Masters v Cameron category, that is, a case in which the terms of the heads of agreement were not indtended to have and therefore did not have any binding effect of their own, and he agreed with the trial judge that the parties did not intend the heads of agreement to have binding effect as their concluded bargain ([121]-[124]). Since Anaconda was decided by the Court of Appeal on 17 February 2000 it has been cited, considered or applied without disapproval in a number of contract law cases involving questions of incompleteness or uncertainty, for example: Duskwood Pty Ltd v Bellara Willows Pty Ltd [2001] per Steytler J at [95]; Liristis Holdings Pty Ltd v Wallville Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 428 per Barrett J at [38]; African Minerals Limited v Pan Palladium Limited [2003] NSWSC 268 per Einstein J at [26]; Thompson v White & Ors [2006] NSWCA 350 per Tobias JA with whom Ipp and McColl JJA agreed at [100]; Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair [2008] NSWCA 248 per Giles JA with whom McColl JA and Young CJ in EQ agreed at [27]-[28]; Donald Fin Enterprises Pty Ltd v APIR Systems Ltd (2008) 67 ACSR 219 per Edmonds J at [131]-[132]; Strzelecki Holdings Pty Ltd v Cable Sands Pty Ltd [No 3] [2009] WASC 352 per Murray J at [90]. The approach taken in G R Securities 40 NSWLR 631, Anaconda [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 and Tasman Capital [2008] NSWCA 248 was followed very recently by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Moffat Property Development Group [2009] QCA 60 , mentioned above, which underlined the importance of the parties' manifest intention to contract. The issue was whether a contract for the sale of rural residential land had been made by an exchange of letters. The Queensland Court of Appeal held that the parties intended to be legally bound through their exchange of correspondence and that there was a contract even though matters such as the timing of completion and arrangements at settlement, the precise timing of the payment of the deposit, the place of settlement, responsibility for insurance, GST issues and the terms of a put and call option were not spelt out in the correspondence. Keane JA delivered the court's judgment. His Honour: (a) accepted McHugh JA's point in G R Securities that \"the decisive issue is always the intention of the parties\": [23]-[25]; (b) said \"the terms of the correspondence exchanged between the parties contemplated the execution of a further contract as the means whereby the bargain which they had concluded would be implemented. It is necessarily implicit in such an agreement that the parties will co-operate to do what must be done to make the further agreement\": [30]; (c) adopted McHugh JA's approach in G R Securities and explained that the implied obligation of each party to co-operate with the other to ensure each side obtains the benefit of its bargain serves to supply the deficiencies: [34]; (d) cited Australian Broadcasting Corporation v XIVth Commonwealth Games 18 NSWLR at 548 in stating: \"I am of the view that there can be no doubt as to the orthodoxy of referring to 'implied terms or ... considerations of reasonableness' in order to determine whether the parties' 'consensus is sufficiently comprehensive to be legally binding : [51]. Accordingly, Moffat Property Development Group [2009] QCA 60 , has most recently emphasised that the central question is the parties' manifest intention to contract, and the court will apply orthodox principles of implying terms, by reference to the implied duty to co-operate, and use considerations of reasonableness, to give effect to the parties' contractual intention. Alleged uncertainty or incompleteness is usually able to be overcome if the requisite intention to contract is found to be present. Was the opinion of FMG and Forrest honestly and reasonably held? In my view, for the following reasons, the evidence, particularly as to the oversight and legal advice given to FMG by Huston and the adoption of FMG's opinion by the Chinese Contractors amply supports the conclusion that the opinion of FMG through Forrest that the framework agreements were legally binding agreements to build, finance and transfer the infrastructure, were reasonably and honestly held. It also disposes of ASIC's claim that if FMG had obtained competent legal advice it would not have made the disclosures it did as to the legal effect of the framework agreements. ASIC alleges in relation to FMG's disclosures that neither it nor Forrest genuinely held the opinion that each of the framework agreements was a legally enforceable build, finance and transfer agreement. It palpably failed to establish this allegation. Indeed, I find for the following reasons that there is cogent evidence from which it may be inferred that the opinions were genuinely held. FMG's honesty in this respect depends on that of Forrest and other members of its board. That FMG's opinion was genuine may be inferred from other facts. For reasons contained under Part 3 I draw no Jones v Dunkel inference against Forrest by reason of him not giving evidence. It is instructive to consider the following: (a) legal oversight and advice; (b) the position adopted by the Chinese Contractors; (c) FMG's internal records; (d) FMG's external communications; (e) the position adopted by FMG executives; (f) Advanced framework agreements; (g) comparison with other FMG documents. Legal oversight and advice ASIC, in respect to its case under s 674, pleads at ASC [136(3)] amongst other things, that FMG by its board, including Forrest, ought to have come into possession of the parts of the Informations concerning, on ASIC's case, the legal effect of the framework agreements by first obtaining competent legal advice as to the legal effect of the framework agreements. There is no express pleading tying this alleged failure to obtain legal advice to ASIC's case against FMG under s 1041H of the Act or against Forrest under s 180 of the Act. Nonetheless in its written closing submissions ASIC says that the failure related to the \"statements and claims in the releases and in presentation documents in subsequent months\". This is a clear reference to ASIC's contention that these statements and claims were misleading and deceptive. I will consider the allegation directly in relation to the s 674 case. If made good it would also be made good for ASIC's other cause of action under s 1041H. There is no prejudice to FMG or Forrest in this approach. Section 674(2) does not require, expressly or impliedly, that corporations obtain legal advice to inform their opinions as to what is notifiable information for the purposes of compliance. It may be that in some circumstances the taking of legal advice may be regarded as essential to the corporation putting itself in a position where it ought reasonably to know particular information. Where that advice is as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement the position becomes problematic. Even the best of legal minds can differ. The competing submissions of the eminent senior counsel who appeared before me, as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements highlights the difficulties involved for corporations generally and for FMG in particular in such circumstances. ASIC submits that there is no evidence of FMG obtaining any legal advice before the key decisions were taken to make the notifications to the ASX of 23 August and 5 and 8 November 2004. ASIC pleads [ASC 136 at Particular (3)] that the executive officers and members of the FMG board ought to have come into the possession of the CREC Information, CHEC Information and CMCC Information by first obtaining competent legal advice about the legal effect of the framework agreements given their importance to FMG. In fact the question under Listing Rule 19.12, which defines \"aware\", is whether the director(s) or executive officer(s) ought reasonably to have come into possession of the information. ASIC submits that had such advice been obtained, the misleading statements could not have been made by a responsible company or board of directors and that the failure by FMG to obtain legal advice is a relevant consideration. ASIC did not lead expert opinion evidence as to what such an opinion was likely to have been had it been sought. ASIC referred to ASIC v Macdonald [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199. There, Gzell J found at [1275] that ASIC had made out its case that the company, James Hardie Industries Limited, negligently failed to disclose information concerning the restructuring of the company in contravention of Listing Rule 3.1 and s 1001A(2) of the Corporations Law as carried over into the Act for reasons including that it did not obtain any legal advice as to whether it should disclose the information. The information did not consist of an opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement. ASIC pleads at ASC [102] that by 26 January 2005, FMG and Forrest were aware firstly that CREC, CHEC and CMCC did not regard the framework agreements as requiring them to construct and finance the infrastructure necessary for the Project; and secondly that the agreements did not have the effect of obliging those companies to construct and finance the infrastructure. Among the particulars relied on by ASIC to establish FMG's and Forrest's knowledge are the minutes of a meeting of FMG's directors including Forrest on 22 January 2005, and Huston's attendance at the meetings on 16 and 17 January 2005 involving FMG and the representatives of CREC, CHEC and CMCC, together with Huston's status as a qualified, experienced and practicing commercial solicitor. I have discussed in some detail the meetings of 16 and 17 January in Part 9. At those meetings, FMG and the Chinese Contractors discussed their relationship and sought to reach agreement on the size of the equity interest that FMG would grant to a Chinese entity. I have found that the Chinese suggestion at the 17 January meeting that the previous agreements were merely MOUs was a negotiating tactic employed to advance their case for a majority equity interest in the Project. ASIC did not specify in its pleading what aspect of the 22 January minutes it was relying on to establish either or both of these assertions. In fact, ASIC made no reference to this document in oral or written submissions. Further, ASIC did not plead nor explain in submissions just how it was that Huston's attendance at the 16 and 17 January meetings and his status as a qualified, experienced and practicing commercial solicitor advanced ASIC's assertions. The CHEC Framework Agreement was executed on 1 October 2004. The CMCC Framework Agreement was executed on 20 October 2004. It is common ground that Huston joined FMG as in-house counsel shortly before 3 October 2004 although he had acted as FMG's solicitor on a private basis before that. Heyting, in his written statement explained: Before about mid 2004, FMG did not have an in-house legal team. Peter Huston, a lawyer from Troika Legal Ltd, started employment at FMG (and worked in its office) from about the latter half of 2004. His assistant, Hsin-Luen Tan also worked at FMG. Prior to that time, Huston and Tan were contactable for legal advice by telephone, email or fax as and when required. (Abbreviations omitted) ASIC tendered through the witness statement of Jennifer Margaret Leonard dated 21 April 2008 details concerning Huston, amongst others, taken from FMG's website. Mr Huston joined Fortescue (FMG) in October 2004 and has over 20 years experience in legal and commercial advisory roles. Prior to joining Fortescue, Mr Huston spent 14 years as a Partner of Deacons. Mr Huston is Chairman of Resolute Gold and holds several other Directorships. Mr Huston is considered a renowned corporate Lawyer in Perth. Mr Huston is admitted as a Solicitor and Barrister of the Supreme Court of Western Australia and has a Bachelor of Jurisprudence, Bachelor of Laws (with Honours), Bachelor of Commerce and a Master of Laws. Forrest had known Huston for a number of years prior to this. Huston acted as solicitor for Anaconda Nickel Ltd in proceedings against Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd in the Supreme Court of Western Australia: [2000] WASCA 27 ; (2000) 22 WAR 101. These concerned the enforceability of a short letter said to be a \"heads of agreement\". In certain respects it bears a remarkable similarity to the framework agreements. The then Full Court, in 2000, by majority (Ipp J; Pidgeon J agreeing) held that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding agreement. The judgment in that case was the foundation of the view held and the advice given by Huston. It was a case which was already well-known to Forrest. He had been Anaconda's CEO at the time of the litigation and its signatory to the heads of agreement which was the subject matter in the case. FMG and Forrest in particular, at least from the beginning of Oct 2004, if not before, were focused on ensuring that FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. This included the framework agreements. It is apparent that one of Huston's principal roles at FMG was to oversee and ensure the legal enforceability or, as Forrest sometimes described it, the \"bankability\" of FMG's agreements. On 3 October 2004 Forrest distributed a lengthy email to, amongst others, FMG executives and Huston in which he welcomed Huston to the team. Paragraph 3 with the heading \"Legally binding contracts\" included the following : Some agreements have been written in an ad hoc way with the best means available to the executive responsible. Unfortunately, on a full Bankers legal due diligence some of these may not pass the enforceability test. Gentlemen, please ensure with Peter complete legal enforceability on the agreements that we are all relying to construct FMG. The text of the email, almost entirely, concerns the three framework agreements. In context, therefore, I take this request by Forrest to be referring to, or at least to include, those agreements. Forrest concluded by saying \"... I am happy with the release, subject to P. Huston's sign off on the enforceability, to go. \" This appears to be a reference to a press release concerning an iron ore contract with a Chinese company called Hebei. It again evidences Forrest's quite specific concern that FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. On 20 October 2004, after the execution of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements but before the formal Joint Statement signing ceremony in Beijing on 5 November 2004 when those agreements became binding, Forrest sent an email to various FMG personnel, including Huston, where he referred approvingly to David Liu and his co-ordination of the arrangements with the three Chinese Contractors. He also thanked Huston for his contribution. He said: Peter, (Huston) thanks for the rappid (sic) fire support tonight. Hope we got your instructions right --- these contract (sic) better be bankable because people are signing them. David pls get the two we worked on today down to Peter for his all clear. I take the word \"bankable\" in this context to mean such as to satisfy potential FMG financiers, in the course of their due diligence process, as to the \"legal enforceability\" of these contracts. Forrest's emails confirm that he, on behalf of FMG, was relying on Huston in his capacity as a lawyer to oversee and ensure that agreements entered into by FMG were legally enforceable. They also confirm that Huston in performing that role had given advice (\"instructions\") to FMG to that end in relation to some contracts. It is not clear that Forrest was speaking here of the framework agreements, although they may well have been included. Further, against that background, and because of the following, I infer that Huston was involved in preparing the 8 November Letter to the ASX and its earlier draft. After receiving the 5 November Letter and prior to receiving the 8 November Letter, Walsh contacted Campbell of FMG and asked him to provide the material terms of the agreements and the effect of the agreements on FMG. I take him to be saying that he asked for information as to the material terms and legal effect of these agreements. A meeting was arranged for Monday 8 November 2004. On Sunday, 7 November 2004, Campbell sent an email to Walsh stating that FMG would be making a further announcement regarding the signing of a state agreement with the West Australian government regarding tenure certainty for the port and rail facilities. In his email, Campbell referred to having discussed the announcement of the state agreement with Walsh on Friday afternoon. This was Friday 5 November 2004. On the Saturday, 6 November 2004, Campbell sent an email to a number of persons including Forrest, Huston and Field, the public relations adviser, in connection with a two page draft release concerning the state agreement. It states, in part: I have attached a draft of a release for Monday. The assumption here is that the ASX does require more information on the deals signed on Friday (to be confirmed on Monday after an initial discussion with Tony Walsh and Peter Huston). I understand the reference to \"the deals signed on Friday\" to describe the Joint Statement signing ceremony in Beijing on 5 November which rendered the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements binding. The draft release was dated 8 November 2004 and entitled \"FMG Executes State Agreement for Rail Infrastructure\". The first page of the draft dealt with the execution of the state agreement. The last paragraph on the first page of this draft referred to the three framework agreements and contained a sentence stating that the Chinese companies would be working with FMG and Worley under the DFS to establish a firm price which would then be incorporated into a fixed price contract with each party. That paragraph and sentence appears, with minor variations, in the 8 November Letter. What follows on the second page of that draft are six further paragraphs, the first two of which describe the pricing and payment arrangements under the framework agreements, the next three of which relate to the MOUs with ThyssenKrupp, and Barclay Mowlem, with the final paragraph being the letter's conclusion containing further reference to the state agreement and the DFS and emphasizing FMG's progress towards its stated aim of becoming the new force in iron ore. The purposes of the 8 November meeting, according to Walsh, were firstly for him to determine whether the information in the notifications to the ASX from FMG conveyed sufficient information about the material terms and conditions of the framework agreements for investors to be able to make an informed decision; and secondly to discuss the state agreement. At this meeting Campbell and Huston, who was involved in this discussion on behalf of FMG as its in-house counsel, gave Walsh a draft copy of a letter from FMG to the ASX dated 8 November 2004 headed \"FMG Executes State Agreement for Rail & Port Infrastructure\". This was slightly different to the draft circulated by Campbell on Saturday 6 November. The heading included a reference to port infrastructure as well as rail. The first page of the letter discussed the relevance of the state agreement to the port infrastructure as well as the rail. On the second page, the three paragraphs from the Friday draft further explaining the framework agreement pricing and payment terms were reproduced with minor variation. The paragraphs from the Friday draft concerning the MOU and the three non-Chinese contractors were not reproduced. I make the following inferences. First, that Campbell's email was copied to Huston in order for him to vet the contents of the attached draft release. Second, that Huston would have had a copy of the 5 November Letter as well as of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. Certainly the draft referred indirectly to the 5 November Letter when it stated \"As advised on Friday ...\" and later \"As further advised on Friday ...\" as well as directly to \"three separate Agreements signed with China Rail, China Harbour and China Metallurgical respectively\". This would have been necessary for him to properly consider the ASX requests and the terms of the 8 November draft. Third, that if Huston in performing his role of overseeing FMG's agreements to ensure that they were legally enforceable had thought the framework agreements were not legally enforceable build and transfer agreements as described in the 5 November Letter and reinforced in the 8 November Letter he would have so advised FMG. According to Forrest's 3 October 2004 email referred to, Huston had been employed by FMG principally to ensure its agreements were legally enforceable. Absent advice from Huston at that time, that the framework agreements were not, in his opinion, legally enforceable the FMG board, including Forrest, was entitled to continue to regard them as binding build and transfer agreements. I infer that they did so. This was a reasonable and responsible position for the board to adopt. It stands at the opposite end of the spectrum from the commercial dishonesty alleged against them and in particular alleged against Forrest. This position was reinforced when Huston later gave FMG's board, including Forrest, positive advice that the CMCC Framework Agreement was legally binding. A record of this is set out in the minutes of a board of directors meeting chaired by Forrest and held on 22 January 2005. A question was raised concerning the practical and legal effect of the framework agreements. The issue then was whether the agreements obliged the Chinese Contractors to build and transfer the Project infrastructure. This question may have been prompted by the comment made by Mr Ma Yanli, Chairman of CMCC, during the 17 January meeting, that the CMCC Framework Agreement was only a MOU. Forrest, as the Chairman, noted that FMG was doing all that it had to do, namely, satisfy the financial requirement to pay a 10% deposit, complete the DFS process and delineate a resource base sufficient to provide the security that was required. It was noted that the Chinese parties were being slow to fulfil their obligations. The minutes then record the following: The Chairman referred comment on the legal side of the obligations under the agreement to Mr Huston who joined the meeting at this time. Mr Huston made reference to the obligations that had been specified under the respective agreements and the fact that they indeed could be determined through the judicial system to be binding. In support of this statement Mr Huston referred to a previous legal case where he had represented Mr Forrest as CEO of Anaconda Nickel Ltd who had brought action against Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd pursuant to terms agreed under a \"Heads of Agreement\". The obligations under this agreement were being contested by Tarmoola as not binding given the nature of the agreement signed. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Western Australia where it was found in favour of Anaconda and determined that obligations under a Heads of Agreement could indeed be found to be legally binding on the parties. ASIC made no reference to these minutes in oral or written submissions. I consider the above passage in these minutes which records the provision of legal advice by Huston to the FMG board as to the legal effect of the CMCC Framework Agreement, to be of significant importance to the resolution of ASIC's claims under both s 674 and s 1041H. These minutes were brought to my attention, for the first time, by senior counsel for Forrest, Mr Myers QC, on the last day of the trial. A restatement of Huston's opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements was contained in his email dated 30 March 2005 sent to FMG executives, including Forrest, following the publication of the AFR Article. That article asserted that the framework agreements did not bind the Chinese Contractors to build the Project infrastructure. Huston advised FMG, in effect, that it was appropriate for FMG to continue to publicly maintain that the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements did bind the Chinese Contractors to build the Project infrastructure. The email was entitled \" Anaconda Nickel Pty Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd --- The Extraordinary Lengths The Courts Will Go To In Order To Bind Parties to their Agreement\" and stated: There is lots of current discussion in the media and elsewhere about the meaning and differences in the terms \"agreement\", \"contract\" \"binding\" and the like. As you may be aware when Andrew was at Anaconda we won an important case for him on appeal to the Supreme Court on the binding nature of a 6 paragraph Heads of Agreement dealing with a project with a value of many hundreds of millions. I enclose for your reference a copy of an article on that case issued in the Notre Dame University Law Review which just goes to show that even a document such as that Heads of Agreement for an important and complex Joint Venture with all of the many formal issues not dealt with was still held to be binding by the Western Australian Supreme Court. Thus if journalist (sic) want to know why Andrew (Forrest) considers the (C)MCC agreement to be binding he is amongst other thing relying on his own direct experience from this supreme Court Case. This email was not referred to in ASIC's pleading. Nor did ASIC refer to it in its written or oral submissions. Yet again, the email was brought to my attention, for the first time, by senior counsel for Forrest on the last day of the trial. Again, I consider the content of the email to be of significant importance to the resolution of ASIC's claims under both s 674 and s 1041H. It is clear from the combination of the 22 January minutes and Huston's 30 March email that, in his opinion, the CMCC Framework Agreement was a binding build and transfer agreement. The case to which he referred was Anaconda Nickel Ltd v Tarmoola Australia Pty Ltd [2000] WASCA 27 ; 22 WAR 101 which I have referred to previously. That case concerned the enforceability of a letter containing 5 clauses and described as a \"heads of agreement\" signed by Forrest who then was Chief Executive of Anaconda. The letter concluded, in terms not dissimilar to clause 7 in each of the framework agreements: The above forms a heads of agreement which constitutes an agreement in itself intended to be replaced by a fuller agreement not different in substance or form. The respondent, Tarmoola, signed the letter confirming its agreement to the tems and conditions set out in it. The parties then entered into negotiations for the \"fuller agreement\" but those negotiations were unsuccessful. No \"fuller agreement' was concluded. Anaconda , amongst other relief, sought a declaration that the heads of agreement was a valid and binding contract. The respondent argued that it was not so bound on a number of bases, including lack of intention to create a binding legal relationship because so many important matters had been omitted, lack of certainty and completeness of the contract. The appeal was successful and the declaration was granted. Tarmoola's application to the High Court for special leave to appeal (P15/2000) was discontinued. Huston , I infer, during the period he was overseeing FMG's agreements, had a detailed knowledge of this case and the reasons for judgment. He was Anaconda's instructing solicitor in that case. As ASIC pleads, Huston was an experienced and practising commercial solicitor. He had, as I have said, been directly involved in preparing the 8 November Letter which concerned all three framework agreements. One of Huston's principal responsibilities was to ensure that FMG's agreements were legally enforceable. He had not suggested to the FMG Board, including Forrest, that the framework agreements were not legally enforceable. His opinion expressed in the 22 January 2005 board minutes and the 30 March 2005 email that the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding necessarily must have applied to the other two framework agreements. FMG's and Forrest's opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements was shaped and informed by Huston's involvement. They had the benefit of his dedicated professional oversight and later his advice as to the legal enforceability of the framework agreements. Forrest as CEO, was directly involved in the Anaconda case and would have been well aware of the judgments both at first instance and on appeal as well as the discontinuance of Tarmoola's application for special leave to appeal to the High Court. Forrest then had the benefit of legal advice in relation to the legal enforceability of a similar agreement. Huston alluded to this in his 30 March 2005 email when he stated, referring to the Anaconda decision: Thus if journalist(s) want to know why Andrew (Forrest) considers the (C)MCC agreement to be binding he is amongst other things relying on his own direct experience from this (S)upreme Court Case. All relevant FMG staff had been told by Forrest in early October to ensure, through Huston, that FMG agreements were legally enforceable. The evidence also demonstrates that, contrary to ASIC's assertion, Huston did give legal advice to FMG as to the legal enforceability of the framework agreements. In particular, the 22 January minutes show that the FMG board turned its mind to the question of whether the CMCC Framework Agreement was binding following the statement by Mr Ma at the 17 January meeting, that it sought legal advice on that question from Huston and that he answered the question in the affirmative. If, as I think likely, although I make no finding, he was asked to advise on the issue of the legal enforceability of the CREC Framework Agreement prior to the 23 August notification, it is reasonable to infer that his opinion and reasons for it were, or would have been, the same as he later twice provided to FMG's board. I find, for the above reasons, that FMG did have a genuine and/or reasonable basis for making the disclosures which it did concerning the binding nature of the framework agreements. I have, based on this evidence, no hesitation in concluding that FMG and its board including Forrest honestly held the opinion that the framework agreements were legally binding in the way described in the disclosures. I do not consider there to have been a reasonable basis for ASIC to contend that they were dishonest in this respect. The position adopted by the Chinese Contractors It is relevant to consider what position the Chinese Contractors adopted as to the legal effect of the respective framework agreements during the period ASIC asserts disclosure of the respective Informations ought to have been made by FMG to the ASX. The period is from 23 August 2004 to 24 or 30 March 2005. In order to confirm its view as to the legal effect of the CREC Framework Agreement, it was entirely reasonable for FMG to inquire from CREC, in effect, as to whether it shared FMG's view as to what the parties had in substance agreed so that the market could be informed. In my opinion this evidence is relevant and admissible. It is to be distinguished from the rule excluding evidence of subjective intention in a curial contest as to the proper construction of a contract. Rather, it goes to the reasonableness of the efforts by FMG by its board including Forrest to make itself \"aware\" of the information to be disclosed to the ASX. FMG did this by seeking CREC's approval of the terms of the 23 August Media Release. The obtaining of this approval is also relevant to the questions whether FMG's and Forrest's opinion as to the legal effect of the framework agreement was reasonably and honestly held. I will deal with this second aspect below. The signing ceremony on 19 August 2004 for the \"Joint Statement by the Board of Directors\" in respect of the CREC Framework Agreement was, according to Kirchlechner, a high level, serious and solemn occasion. This event, as I earlier described, was covered by the Chinese press. At no point before 24 March 2005 did any Chinese entity or person suggest to the market that the disclosures made by FMG that the framework agreements were legally binding build and transfer agreements were in any way inaccurate. There were many opportunities over the extended period for anyone to have done so. Following this and prior to the 23 August Letter hyperlinked to the 23 August Media Release being sent to the ASX and published on FMG's website respectively, CREC approved the 23 August Media Release. A draft of the media release was emailed by Catlow to Bai of CREC on 20 August 2004 asking him to consider it and to let FMG have CREC's approval as soon as possible. He did so in response to a written request, by email, from Juliet Morrin, Forrest's executive assistant, on behalf of Forrest. Catlow then emailed Morrin, as well as Forrest informing them that he had sent the draft to Bai and asking Morrin to ask \"David\", that is David Liu, to call Bai and to respond \"ASAP\" and preferably within the hour for the \"Oz media\". Catlow concluded by saying that \"they\", I infer the Australian media, are \"getting restless on the back of the trading halt\". The 23 August Media Release is not in exactly the same terms as the draft. This was amended by omission and addition as well as rearrangement of text. Those parts of the draft which describe the agreement as \"a binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of Fortescue Metals Group Ltd $1.85 billion Pilbara Iron Ore Project\", and describing it as a \"Build and Transfer (BT) contract\", amongst others, remained intact. I infer that Bai approved those parts of the draft at least. I do not think that FMG or Forrest would have permitted the 23 August Media Release to be published without that consent. Forrest and Bai spoke by telephone on 20 August 2004. Forrest had been asked by Catlow as to whether the CREC Framework Agreement was binding or whether FMG should wait for NDRC approval before publicly announcing that it was binding. Bai told Forrest that it was binding. That conversation it appears occurred after Bai had received the draft media release. If Bai had not agreed its terms then I expect that he would have told Forrest. The fact that Forrest himself checked with Bai about NDRC approval before publicly announcing that the agreement was binding illustrates Forrest's unwillingness to make such an important announcement without first checking with CREC directly. I infer that his approach was likely to have been the same in respect to the 23 August Media Release. This fact is, in my opinion, of very great significance. CREC clearly considered that it had made \"a binding agreement to build and finance the railway component of (FMG's) $1.85 billion Pilbara iron ore project\". CREC is a massive Chinese conglomerate of considerable sophistication. It was, in 2004, China's largest construction company. It is unthinkable that Bai, on its behalf, would approve this most important aspect of the draft media release unless he honestly and genuinely believed that this properly characterised the effect of the agreement made between CREC and FMG. It is a factor of compelling force in judging the beliefs of Forrest to have been both honest and reasonable. On 13 October 2004 Zhang from CREC wrote to Heyting at FMG and said, amongst other things, \"please be assured that CREC-JV with BMCL (Barclay Mowlem) will implement the project fully to your satisfaction without technical obstacles\". This is cogent evidence that CREC was acting in a way consistent with the existence not only of a binding agreement with FMG but one which CREC was intent upon performing. As to the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements there is no evidence that approval of a draft of the 5 November Media Release was expressly sought or obtained by FMG. However, the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements were, in substance, in the same terms as the CREC Framework Agreement. I do not think FMG or Forrest had any reason to think that the characterisation of the legal effect of these agreements was any different to that afforded to the CREC Framework Agreement. The signing ceremony on 5 November 2004 at the Australian Embassy in Beijing for the approval of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements to render them binding agreements pursuant to cl 5 in each case was also a major event. It was attended by Chinese and Australian government bureaucrats, Australia's Ambassador to China who gave a speech, the Federal Member for Kalgoorlie, senior executives of the companies involved and media representatives. At that signing ceremony, pictures were taken of Forrest and Qin that were described by Qin as \"solidifying the marriage\". Copies of the 5 November Media Release which covered each of the framework agreements were made available at the ceremony for the CHEC, CMCC, SASAC and the NDRC officials who attended as well as to members of the Chinese and Australian media. ASIC did not tender any evidence that CHEC, CMCC or the two Chinese Government authorities disputed the terms of the 5 November Media Release then or at at any later time. There was a shift in the position of the Chinese Contractors orchestrated by Mr He of the NDRC using the vehicle of the AFR Article of 24 March 2005. I have considered this at length in Part 9 below and concluded that this was posturing by Mr He as a negotiation tactic and did not reflect the true opinion of CREC, CHEC and CMCC as to the legal effect of the framework agreements. The acknowledgment by the Chinese Contractors that the framework agreements were binding continued well into 2005. ASIC pleaded at ASC [107]-[108] that a breakdown of FMG's Chinese relationship occurred on 10 February 2005. There is no reference in ASIC's pleading of any negotiations between FMG and the Chinese after 10 February 2005. This allegation is not supported by the evidence. By letter dated 1 March 2005 Forrest wrote to Mr He. The letter evidences the then understanding between the parties. In the second paragraph Forrest wrote: Thank you also for sharing my absolute certainty in the project and its value to China and China's relationship with Australia. I believe that successful implementation of the Project will bring very significant benefits to both countries. The final paragraph on page 2 and the first four paragraphs on page 3 are also instructive on this question. First, FMG was informing the NDRC that it was engaged in discussions with other construction institutions if, for some reason, the framework agreements with the Chinese Contractors did not proceed. This demonstrates that negotiations were still on foot with the hope that the Project would continue with the Chinese Contractors. FMG was using this it would appear as commercial leverage with the Chinese. Second, it shows that so far as FMG was concerned the tender process for equity that Citigroup was undertaking was independent of the framework agreements. On 29 June 2005 Bai confirmed in writing that he intended that CREC would meet the obligation of the existing build and transfer agreement dated 6 August 2004. He confirmed CREC's intention to undertake the design/engineering works which he said were planned to begin in July 2005. In an email of 7 September 2005, David Liu reported on a meeting with Yang, Chairman of CMCC, who \"insisted repeatedly that the agreements signed between us were in fact binding\". There is further evidence that CREC held the same opinion as FMG as to the legal effect of the CREC Framework Agreement. CREC entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on 1 September 2004 with Barclay Mowlem, a potential subcontractor for the Project, in which CREC stated that CREC had ' entered into an agreement with FMG on the 19th August 2004 for the build and transfer of the Project '. FMG's internal records Had it been the case that Forrest on behalf of FMG was saying one thing about the CREC Framework Agreement, as to its legal effect, publicly and something different, privately within FMG, then one would expect that difference to emerge from a consideration of the internal documents of various kinds within FMG. No such difference is evidenced on the material before me. Indeed, to the contrary, FMG's private records underpin its public announcements. Illustratively, on 27 August 2004 an FMG board meeting was held. The CREC Framework Agreement was discussed. The minutes record: A key topic was the binding agreement signed with China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) whereby CREC will deliver a fully commissioned iron ore railway on a fixed price fully warranted basis. This evidences that Forrest and other board members considered that the CREC Framework Agreement was a binding agreement for CREC to build and transfer the railway. It was not expressed to be conditional upon NDRC approval nor the grant of minority equity to a Chinese entity. The minutes of the 22 January 2005 FMG board meeting show that FMG believed the Chinese were trying to negotiate the best equity position. The FMG board saw any problems as short term issues arising in a negotiation. The minutes record the pressure on the steel mills by NDRC as being \"short term\" and the attitude of CMCC and NDRC as being the \"current\" attitude. FMG's external communications It is also instructive to consider FMG's external communications concerning the framework agreements. On 2 September 2004 Catlow on behalf of FMG wrote to GE Commercial Finance including the following: We have now signed the binding build, transfer and finance contract with China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) for the railway and rolling stock, with the exception of locomotives. CREC is the largest construction group in China with plans to become the largest in Asia within 3 to 5 years. Because of the importance of this project to China, the Ministry of Commerce, SASAC and NDRC have all endorsed the CREC contract. The commercial arrangements incorporate an effective 90% completion risk from CREC with only 10% of the agreed contract value payable at financial close 10% at practical completion (PC) approximately 2 years later, 15% on the first and second anniversaries of PC and 50% on the third anniversary of PC. Forrest wrote by letter of 13 September 2004 to the Western Australian Minister for State Development, Mr Clive Brown concerning state agreements which were under negotiation. He stated: The proposed arrangements between FMG and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), whilst legally binding are still evolving in their detail. CREC will build and then transfer the proposed railway to the Infrastructure company while all materials and services used will be subject to the requirement to give West Australian companies a 'fair go'. This too reflects the same corporate view within FMG, on this occasion disclosed to a minister of state. ASIC submits that the content of an email dated 27 October 2004 from Forrest to Heyting and Huston shows that, by then, Forrest and FMG did not have a genuine and/or reasonable belief that the framework agreements contained terms that were essential to commit or bind the Chinese counterparties to construct and finance the rail, port and mine. I reject this submission. The email speaks of Bai of CREC wanting to sign a \"detailed contract as detailed enough to be binding on the total delivery of the project\". Later Forrest writes The contract on its own must be able to deliver the project, not in itself but as the key binding others to take all necessary steps (like engineering design) to deliver. It must have sufficient detail in it to really deliver the schedule, the financing and the project. It does not matter that other agreements still required are bound through this contract to be agreed but that this contract is the master and sets out what needs to be done. The email is at most ambivalent. Further, arguably, such an agreement had already been made in the CREC Framework Agreement. The parties, by the terms of the 23 August Media Release, acknowledged this to be so. This was acknowledged again in the 5 November Media Release which also referred to CREC. We therefore look forward very much to the three BT contracts being fulfilled in accordance with the original timing agreed to by all four parties (Fortescue and China Railway Engineering Corporation, Fortescue and China Rail Engineering Corporation and Fortescue and China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (\"MCC\")) and hope to receive your confirmation that this will happen. This is a clear statement that just before the AFR Article of 24 March 2005 FMG believed that the contracts should be fulfilled on behalf of three Chinese Contractors and that the only equity that would be going to the Chinese, at most, would be a minority equity in a mine. This confirmed that all discussions up to that point were negotiations that FMG honestly and reasonably believed would still result in the Project proceeding. The position adopted by FMG executives If there was a view within FMG as to the legal effect of the framework agreements inconsistent with that advanced in the various notifications it might be expected to be manifest in the views of FMG's senior executives such as Kirchlechner and Heyting. This evidence on behalf of ASIC was intended to expose such inconsistencies. Kirchlechner was employed by FMG as Head of Marketing, reporting directly to Forrest, from July 2003 to 18 May 2006. He reported to Rowley when Forrest was absent. He speaks fluent Chinese, and has lived and worked in China for 16 years. He left FMG as a result of a continuing dispute with Forrest about shares. In his witness statement, Kirchlechner described his role with FMG as follows: Initially, although I was focused upon marketing, I also carried out a variety of tasks which were not strictly marketing related given the small size of FMG. For example, Forrest often used to ask me to serve as a translator to and from Chinese in discussions between himself and representatives of Chinese companies and government authorities. Due to my wide ranging contacts in China, my role was also to introduce FMG to key government and steel industry decision makers. However, as FMG grew in size, my role became more focused upon marketing, and in particular marketing to international and Chinese steel mills wishing to purchase iron ore. Annexed to Kirchlechner's witness statement were a number of emails and other documents concerning the negotiations with the Chinese. Kirchlechner purported to give evidence about FMG's equity discussions with the Chinese, but, in cross-examination, he agreed that documents that were important to the equity discussions were not annexed to his statement. He agreed that he was not shown these documents by ASIC's lawyers. Kirchlechner received a copy of the 23 August Media Release before it was published. He agreed, in cross-examination, that the statement in the opening paragraph referring to CREC's execution of a binding agreement to build and finance the railway accorded with his understanding of what had occurred at the Joint Statement signing ceremony in Beijing. Heyting was employed by FMG, as Project Manager of Infrastructure, from February 2004 to July 2005. He left FMG's employ by mutual arrangement following a dispute over some share options. At FMG he reported to and took instructions from Watling, Rowley and Forrest. He is experienced in working on large projects of not dissimilar magnitude to the Project which involved the construction of infrastructure. In those projects he assisted with drafting engineering contracts. In his role at FMG he was principally involved in the management of the prefeasibility study and the DFS. His duties included liaising with potential contractors and investors over the more technical engineering details of the Project; compiling the overall Project schedule; and compiling monthly Project reports for submission to FMG's senior management. Heyting was intimately involved in the preparation of the framework agreements. His evidence, significantly, was intended to diminish the force of otherwise clear language contained in the framework agreements. This aspect of his evidence was opened by senior counsel for ASIC as follows: The actual terms of the agreement with CREC are very important to the case ASIC presents. Obviously, your Honour will need to read the entirety of the agreement. I will just point out the particular clauses that we rely upon. The recitals refer in paragraph B to an actual offer. Mr Heyting will say that there was no offer as such; there were discussions of the kind I have touched on, but Mr Heyting drafted recital B with a degree of formality that was greater than the actual discussions. Heyting framed the CREC Framework Agreement in terms of offer and acceptance. In cross-examination he departed from his evidence foreshadowed in opening by ASIC. He agreed that there was an oral offer by CREC to execute the works. The transcript records the following exchange between Heyting and senior counsel for FMG, Mr Karkar QC. I have edited this portion of the transcript by attributing to the text the names of the speakers for clarity: MR KARKAR: So there was an offer by them to execute the work, wasn't there? MR HEYTING: Yes. MR KARKAR: ...you, in drafting this document, wanted to ensure that the document recorded an offer by one party and an acceptance by the other? MR HEYTING: Yes MR KARKAR: And you had done that because you had learned in your contract course that you did that a contract or agreement is constituted by offer and acceptance? MR HEYTING: Yes. MR KARKAR: Certainly recital A and B were designed to improve the enforceability of the agreement? MR HEYTING: Yes. MR KARKAR: And paragraph 7 was inserted [by you] for the express purpose of ensuring enforceability of the agreement? MR HEYTING: Yes. This was a significant departure from his evidence first given in support of ASIC's case. I have already discussed in Part 4 Heyting's role in the preparation of the framework agreements. Heyting said the CREC Framework Agreement that was signed by Forrest in his presence on 6 August 2004 was generally consistent with the broad framework or structure of an AS4300 \"General Conditions of contract for design and construct\", which he said is an extensive and detailed document covering all of the things required for the design and construction of the relevant works such as relevant laws, approvals payment schedules, indemnities, scope of works and specifications. Heyting was also involved in the preparation of advanced framework agreements for CREC, CHEC and CMCC as well as a draft AS4300 type contract. It is also instructive to consider what Heyting stated, variously, as to the nature and effect of the framework agreements, in the period immediately following their execution. On 5 October 2004 Heyting sent an email to Field where, in commenting on a proposed media release, he stated: To use the word \"binding contract\" is almost a double negative, ie it's a contract which is by its name binding so using the phrase binding contract implies we are uncertain that it is actually binding. In cross-examination, Heyting agreed that he meant to say that the phrase \"binding contract\" was tautologous, and that his understanding was that contracts were binding. This understanding was what he told ASIC during his s 19 examination in June 2005. He told ASIC: ... we had an agreement that they were going to build a railway line. Heyting confirmed in cross-examination that that was a true answer. I accept this to be the cause although in certain respects I did not regard Heyting as a reliable witness because of the concessions obtained from him during cross-examination. He was evidently not well disposed toward FMG. His concessions, contrary as they were to his evidence-in-chief, were telling against him and against ASIC's case. In his witness statement at [94] Heyting said that in or about October 2004 he started drafting parts \"of the build and transfer contract between CREC and FMG\". At [95] he said the starting point for this involved him sending an unsigned electronic version of the CREC Framework Agreement to his project engineer Todd Dewar together with a draft table of contents for special conditions for AS4300 type specifications for the contract. At [94] Heyting also said: I was not specifically asked by anyone at FMG to start drafting these parts of the final build and transfer contract. I had always understood that this was what was required as the next stage following the signing of the CREC Framework Agreement. (My emphasis) The addition of the word 'final' to Heyting's second description in [94] of his witness statement of the contract he was preparing in conjunction with Dewar is in my view instructive. It confirms his understanding that the CREC Framework Agreement was binding, but that a fuller and more detailed agreement was to be developed later as contemplated by clause 7. It also confirms that the further agreement he was developing with Dewar was intended as the next level of detailed agreement. If Heyting understood the CREC Framework Agreement to be a non-binding MOU, then I infer that he would have said in his statement or in oral evidence that what he was drafting with Dewar was not the final build and transfer contract but the first such contract, and further, that he was under express instructions from Forrest, Rowley or Watling to prepare such a document. The evidence demonstrates that Heyting used the terms ' contract' and 'agreement' interchangeably, and in each case to mean 'binding'. Heyting never referred to the CREC Framework Agreement as an MOU. I will illustrate this with four examples . On 14 October 2004 Heyting sent an email to an employee of ABB Australia Pty Limited, a company FMG was proposing to involve in the Project to supply and install electrical and control equipment, dated, where Heyting stated: We have now signed two supply contracts and have a build and transfer (BT) agreement for the railway with China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC). In addition as you can imagine we are well advanced on other sales contracts and BT's for the Port and Mine. In that email, Heyting described the CREC Framework Agreement as a \"build and transfer (BT) agreement\". Elsewhere, Heyting described it as a \"build and transfer contract\". On 28 October 2004 Heyting sent an email to Campbell and Watling to which was attached a draft for a report, and in the draft under the heading \"Project Development\" it was stated: FMG develops parallel development strategy. Worley are managing the Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) which will allow FMG to raise finance. Whilst FMG, in parallel, is converting the earlier discussions with potential Chinese contractors into build and transfer contracts. The first of these was formally signed 22 August with CREC. The formal signing ceremony for the CREC Framework Agreement in fact occurred on 19, not 22, August 2004 as stated in Heyting's email. An FMG monthly report for November 2004 prepared by Heyting referred to \"Formal signing ceremony of the port and mines design, construct and finance contracts\" with CHEC and CMCC as a key highlight of the report. On 2 November 2004 Heyting sent an email to an employee of an Austrian rail supplier Voestalpine, a potential tenderer in the Project. The full text of the email, where Heyting referred in the fourth paragraph to the \"build and transfer contract for the railway\", is as follows: Wolfgang As you may be aware our Project is advancing at a great rate of knots. We have appointed Worley as our Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) Manager and they are undertaking among other things the DFS rail alignment design, etc and will be responsible for compiling its estimate and construction schedule. Consideration of the supply of 50 m rail lengths is still a target for us as it reduces on site welding and hence potential weld failures. In parallel we have signed a build and transfer contract for the railway with a large Chinese construction firm called China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC). This obviously will include the supply of rail, turnouts, etc. This does not preclude others from supply to the Project as the contract is about \"best for project\" and if CREC through its Chinese contactors and suppliers cannot supply rail of the quality required, potentially 50 m lengths or meet cost and schedule constraints then they will tender internationally or FMG will remove it from their scope. Further like all contracts there is potential for build and transfer contract to fail at the last minute and therefore FMG will have to resort to an EPCM type contract for the railway and consequently the suppliers involved in the DFS will obviously have an advantage. We would like to meet you and your associates on the 1 pm 29NOV04, however based on the above do you still wish to meet us. Regards Ed Heyting In re-examination by senior counsel for ASIC, Mr Young, Heyting stated further what he meant by the parallel development strategy as referred to in the email above and in other documents emanating from FMG in late 2004: Parallel strategy was to take forward a - I'm trying to think how you would describe this - a build and transfer path with a number of different major contractors, and in parallel to that develop an EPCM type approach such that if one of them failed with BTs, that we could still proceed on the EPCM approach. In response to a request by senior counsel for ASIC for him to describe the EPCM pathway, and explain what is meant by the reference to EPCM and who it is that would be putting in place these contracts, Heyting stated: EPCM is - the intent was there that Worley Parsons, who were undertaking the DFS, would be rolled through onto an EPCM contractor or provider where they would manage contracts on our behalf for the execution of the project, whereby it's a number of smaller contracts; sometimes horizontal, sometimes vertical. In other words, horizontal being one particular discipline or two disciplines; vertically meaning covering all disciplines from civils all the way through to electrical, including mechanical construction. The transcript then records the following exchange involving Mr Young QC and Heyting. I have also edited this portion of the transcript by attributing to the text the names of the speakers for clarity: MR YOUNG: And on the EPCM pathway, what would happen to the arrangements with the Chinese contractors? MR HEYTING: Nothing? MR YOUNG: What do you mean by 'nothing' in this context? MR HEYTING: Obviously that the negotiations had failed, and therefore the contract wasn't in place. MR YOUNG: And what is the other pathway? If you could explain that more fully? MR HEYTING: The other pathway is to let individual contracts or, say, for the - in terms of the railway, for the civil works, for the bridges, for the rolling stock, for the signalling. So not one contract, but multiple contracts. Following on from this, ASIC submits, in relation to FMG's negotiating with potential subcontractors, that FMG adopted this parallel course in case no agreement could be reached under clause 1.19 of the framework agreements. In that case, ASIC says, FMG intended to enter EPC contracts directly with the subcontractors. That may have been so. However, this does not mean that the framework agreements were not binding as FMG had stated in its disclosures. Nor is it to say that FMG was bound to carry out this intention. It could for example have elected to sue the Chinese Contractors for specific performance. Although, as I have concluded above, Heyting consistently described the framework agreements with the Chinese contractors as binding contracts for the Chinese Contractors to build and transfer the Project infrastructure, I also find that he was cognisant of the need to make alternative arrangements for the construction of the infrastructure in the event that the contracts with the Chinese Contractors did not proceed. He sought to make provision for the suppliers involved in the DFS process to be involved in those alternative arrangements, should their implementation become necessary, pursuant to EPCM contracts. It is clear that CREC, CHEC and CMCC were intending to engage Australian contractors to be involved in the building of the port, rail and mine, as demonstrated by the making of the MOUs between the Chinese contractors and Barclay Mowlem, BGC and ThyssenKrupp, a process that had FMG's full knowledge and support. It is hardly surprising that FMG were intending to engage those same contractors to complete the Project in the event that the Chinese could not meet their obligations under the framework agreements. It was only prudent for FMG to have back-up arrangements. I conclude that FMG's use of the parallel development strategy involving Worley and potential subcontractors was not inconsistent with FMG's and Forrest's understanding that the CREC Framework Agreement was a binding contract for CREC to build and transfer the railway. ASIC submits that from late 2004 or early 2005 FMG began arranging contracts for the supply of equipment and for building and construction of the Project infrastructure as if the framework agreements did not exist or were not enforceable. ASIC pointed to a draft letter to Leighton Holdings dated 3 February 2005 prepared by Forrest which contained the statement: \"While Fortescue is satisfied with the Chinese arrangements it has taken a number of steps to \"belt and brace\" its Project financing in case it, for any reason, elected not to proceed with the Chinese Contractors. \" ASIC says this letter treats FMG as entitled to elect not to proceed at its discretion, particularly if the lack of progress with the Chinese risked timely Project development as FMG saw it. I do not accept this submission. The 'election' referred to, if used in a legal sense, could well have referred to an election to terminate for repudiatory conduct. It is by no means clear that here Forrest was using the expression \"elected to not proceed\" in this formal way. It does not evidence a view that Forrest regarded FMG as having some discretion whether to proceed or not with the framework agreements. Such a view finds no support in the evidence as a whole. Furthermore, FMG made no secret of these alternative arrangements. In its letter to the ASX, dated 29 March 2005, responding to the AFR Article, FMG stated that it had advanced discussions with alternate international finance and construction companies including Citigroup and Leighton Holdings Group concerning their involvement in the Project, in parallel to progressing the agreements with the Chinese Contractors. Advanced framework agreements On 27 October 2004, Forrest sent an email to Heyting and Huston regarding the execution of a more detailed agreement with CREC. Forrest stated in that email: Ed (Heyting) pls carry the day in the formulation of these Construction Commissioning contracts with Peter (Huston), particularly with Alan (Watling) out of the country and me out of the State --- relying on you both heavily. Peter, please draw on any support required within FMG. So, let's go through the plan.... Mr Bai from China Rail (CR) is under pressure I believe to sign a detailed contract, as detailed enough to be binding on the total delivery of the project. He demanded it on my last visit. It may well be possible, if we can get it to him tomorrow, that Alan can take him through it and resolve anything contentious when he meets with CR on Monday, for signing potentially shortly thereafter While I am pushing for CR to ?t-ake full responsibility for the commissioning and ramp up, ? a ceiling price of A$600m with incentives, ?guarranteed schedule with shipments in 2006, ?ASO standards etc... and these are all hard asks, due to the political pressure I sense CR is under --- it may well be possible to execute this at the official ceremony after Alan has negotiated any deiscrepancies on Monday. In fact, CR specifically requested this detailed contract execution, but may not have been aware that it could take place this quickly. He did however suggest we sign the detailed agreement at that China Harbours and MCC ceremony. I believe he, Mr Bai from CR, will sign it. Then we start to really rock and roll! The contract on its own must be able to deliver the project, not in itself but as The Key, binding others to take all necessary steps (like engineering design) to deliver it. It must have sufficient detail in to really deliver the schedule, the financing and the project. It does not matter that other agreements still required are bound through this contract to be agreed but that this contract is the master and sets out what needs to be done. ASIC submits that this email shows Mr Forrest's awareness that there was anticipated a negotiation about all of the matters left out of the framework agreements that were essential for a binding BT contract. It submits those matters included ones which FMG had represented to the public and investors had already been agreed in a binding agreement such as a fixed price and performance specifications. Senior counsel for ASIC submits that Forrest knew that, without agreement on those matters, there was nothing that could deliver the schedule or the Project or the financing. Additionally, advanced framework agreements were drawn up in relation to each of the three Chinese Contractors. Heyting said Forrest had said to him words to the effect that: \"We need to take the Framework Agreements further and we need to involve Huston in the drafting of the further agreements. \" Heyting says he drafted the clauses relating to definitions and scope of works. On 29 October 2004 Forrest sent an email to Watling under the subject \"Contract Rail\". This evidently concerns the CREC Advanced Framework Agreement. Forrest wanted Heyting and Huston to consider the terms of the draft before it was sent to CREC. Accordingly, he forwarded a copy of this email himself to each of them. There was no suggestion of equity in the Advanced Framework Agreement. Heyting says he also reviewed the draft CREC Advanced Framework Agreement to ensure it was consistent with the CREC Framework Agreement and believed that the three Advanced Framework Agreements were sent to CREC, CHEC and CMCC for signing. The parties agreed that certainly the draft CREC Advanced Framework Agreement was sent to CREC. Whether Heyting's assertion that the advanced framework agreements for CHEC and CMCC were also sent by FMG to those companies was not the subject of dispute by counsel at trial, and nor was there any documentary evidence from which I could infer that this did not occur. CREC examined the draft CREC Advanced Framework Agreement and provided an amended draft to FMG during November 2004. CREC, which I infer was assisted in this process by a lawyer or other suitably qualified person with drafting skills under the English/Australian legal system, proposed, amongst others, the following amendments: RECITALS By a framework agreement dated 6 August 2004 (\"Original Date\"), FMG accepted CREC's offer to carry out and complete the Build and Transfer of the railway (The \"Works\") as defined in clause 4 for the Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project (The \"Project\") upon the terms and conditions there set out (\"Framework Agreement\"). By a memorandum of understanding dated 1 September 2004 between CREC and BARCLAY MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION LIMITED (BM) agreed to enter into a joint venture for the purposes of undertaking the Works (\"CREC\"). The Parties now wish to enter into this Build and Transfer Framework Agreement Deed (the \"Deed\") in order to clarify various matters in the original Framework Agreement. CREC may with the consent of FMG, appoint subcontractors or other joint venture partners who will be bound by the conditions of this Deed. CONFIRMATION The Parties confirm that, except as mentioned in this Build and Transfer Framework Agreement, the Framework Agreement will continue on in full force effect. In my view the additions proposed by CREC are powerful evidence that CREC regarded the CREC Framework Agreement as a binding build and transfer agreement for the railway. They also demonstrate that CREC regarded the CREC Advanced Framework Agreement as a further agreement toward the objective of concluding the \"fuller and more detailed agreement\" contemplated under cl 7 of the CREC Framework Agreement. I do not regard the negotiations in respect of the CREC Advanced Framework Agreement as evidencing that FMG and Forrest knew that the framework agreements were not binding. Draft Contract No: ABC123 FMG and CREC contemplated, pursuant to the CREC Framework Agreement, the execution of a general conditions of contract document containing more detail than the CREC Framework Agreement. The first draft of this was the \"Contract No: ABC123 Design and construct of railway for Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project\" (Contract No: ABC123). ASIC pleaded at ASC [70] that the type of terms which are essential or usual to bind each of CREC, CHEC and CMCC to construct and finance the parts of the infrastructure necessary to the Project the subject of each of the framework agreements respectively are identified in draft Contract No: ABC123. On 9 November 2004 Todd Dewar, a project engineer employed by FMG sent a document bearing that description by email to Huston with a copy to Heyting. The subject of the email was \"CREC Contract draft\". Dewar wrote in his covering email: \"Peter, Please find attached my attempt at the above. The document purported to be a detailed contract between FMG and CREC for the construction of the railway based on the relevant Australian Standard 4902-2000 General Conditions of Contract for Design and Construct. The document was not complete, and Dewar explained in his email that the formatting was not what he would have hoped. Documents tendered by the parties showed that Heyting and Dewar had been liaising with engineers from Worley in October and November 2004 over the content of a detailed contract between CREC and FMG in relation to various aspects of CREC's role in the DFS and the Project itself. It does not appear to have been sent to CREC. This merely evidences FMG's drafting of the fuller and more detailed agreement contemplated in cl 7 of the CREC Framework Agreement. Comparison with other FMG documents On 23 August 2004, the day of the ASX notifications concerning the CREC Framework Agreement, another document was signed by Forrest on behalf of FMG and a representative of Sinosteel which by a comparison of the text in each assists in appreciating what objectively was intended and understood within FMG by the CREC Framework Agreement. It was a Letter of Intent (LOI) between FMG and Sinosteel. It is an example of other similar documents with Chinese companies executed in November 2003. There are significant differences between the CREC Framework Agreement and the Sinosteel Letter of Intent. (a) The document is entitled 'Letter of Intent' but is nonetheless expressly stated to constitute an agreement between the parties; (b) The Purpose is described as being 'to facilitate the start of a long term partnership'; (c) The Obligations were that 'Both parties would agree to cooperate and establish a long term business partnership (and to) negotiate in good faith' a long-term agreement that will include supply guarantee, off-take guarantee and investment or financing; (d) Formalisation of the agreement was described as 'Both parties agree to exchange information and negotiate with a view to signing a formal agreement during the completion of the (Definitive) Feasibility Study ...'; and (e) It ended with 'It is not intended that this Letter of Intent is to constitute a legally binding agreement, but rather to record the tenor of the discussions held between the parties. ' This document and other similar documents, dealing with very important potential off-take agreements, demonstrate the very different and, indeed, plain language adopted by FMG in respect to arrangements with Chinese counterparts where the intention was not to be bound but merely to agree to negotiate a later legally binding agreement. These documents are in stark contrast to the framework agreements. Conclusion as to awareness of alleged information by FMG directors ASIC has failed to establish that FMG or Forrest, as a director and executive officer of FMG, held or ought reasonably to have held, the opinions which underpin the assertions as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements reflected in the Informations. It follows that I am satisfied, applying the Listing Rule 19.12 definition of 'aware', that FMG did not become aware of the Informations. ASIC's case under s 674(2) fails for this reason alone. FMG was not aware of the Informations, and accordingly was under no obligation to disclose it to the ASX. Applying s 674(2)(b), FMG did not have information at the relevant times that the Listing Rules required it to notify to the market operator, and FMG did not contravene s 674(2) by failing to notify the asserted information to the ASX. Its obligations under s 674(2) were satisfied by making the notifications in August 2004 and November 2004 which accorded with its opinion, reasonably and honestly held, as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. As a consequence of my finding that FMG did not contravene s 674(2), then Forrest could not have been a person who was involved in a contravention of that subsection pursuant to sub-s (2A). It is therefore unnecessary for me to deal with his submission that he did not contravene sub-s (2A) because, for the purposes of sub-s (2B), at all material times, he believed, on reasonable grounds, and took all necessary steps to ensure, that FMG was complying with its obligations under s 674(2) of the Act. 8.3: WAS INFORMATION \"GENERALLY AVAILABLE\" It is beyond doubt that none of the Informations was generally available either before the August notification or the November notification or at any material time thereafter. Sisson and Keene, experts called by ASIC, each reviewed the context of the August and November notifications extensively. Each identified relevant background documents, and analysed their effect. They both expressed the opinion that a common investor could not deduce, conclude or infer that the framework agreements were only agreements to develop and agree the terms upon which CREC, CHEC and CMCC would build and transfer the relevant infrastructure. I accept their opinion. These notifications do not reflect the Informations. They were not intended to do so. They each reflected the opinion of FMG as to the legal effect of the framework agreements. In my view, common investors would, reading the 23 August Letter and the 23 August Media Release as a whole, read this as referring to a binding build and transfer agreement. The position is the same in respect to the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements and the November notifications as to these although, in addition, it was made clear in the 8 November Letter that the price of carrying out the works was not fixed yet, nor was the detailed engineering and design work completed and that there would in due course be a further binding agreement setting out that detail. 8.4: MATERIAL EFFECT ON FMG'S SHARE PRICE I have found that the Informations did not constitute information of which FMG was or ought to have been aware of and that for this reason FMG did not contravene s 674(2) of the Act. I propose, nonetheless, to consider the issue of the materiality under s 674(2)(c)(ii) assuming, for this purpose, that the Informations did constitute information of which FMG ought to have been aware. Materiality: s 674(2)(c)(ii) and s 677 Each of ASIC and FMG submit, and I agree, that s 674(2)(c)(ii) and Listing Rule 3.1 require the issue of materiality to be determined on an ex ante basis, that is a forward, not backward, looking exercise. These provisions require notification to the ASX of information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's shares. In assessing the materiality of the framework agreements, and in considering the sufficiency or adequacy of the disclosures made by FMG concerning these agreements, it is essential to have regard to the context in which the disclosures were made including, in particular, the information publicly available to the market. Watson, ASIC's third expert witness after Sisson and Keene, agreed that the common investor would read the notifications in the context of the publicly known facts at the time. The importance of context was also recognised by Keene, and Houston who was FMG's sole expert witness. Section 677 is an interpretative provision which provides relevantly that for the purposes of s 674 such expectation arises if the information would or would be likely to influence common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's shares. A judgment as to that eventuality is required, by the provisions, to be made before the event. Accordingly the question of whether disclosure of information would or would be likely to influence common investors must necessarily be considered by the disclosing entity in the circumstances before the hypothetical notification to the ASX. Such a judgment, necessarily, cannot include knowledge of the actual effect of various disclosures which were in fact made. I accept however that evidence of the actual effect of the information actually disclosed on FMG's share price may be relevant to assist the Court in its determination of whether s 674(2) has been contravened: Rivkin Financial Services Ltd v Sofcom Ltd (2004) 51 ACSR 486 by analogy at [113]-[116]; Jubilee Mines NL v Riley (2009) 253 ALR 673 at [33], [130] and [134]. This involves an ex post inquiry . Such evidence may constitute a relevant cross-check as to the reasonableness of an ex ante judgment about a different hypothetical disclosure. Gzell J in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) 256 ALR at [1067] said: Where likelihood of the occurrence of an event is in issue and relevant facts are available, they are to be preferred to prophecies. This, in effect, was a restatement of what was said by Dixon J in Willis v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 22 ; (1946) 73 CLR 105 at 116 who in turn had cited a passage from Uthwatt J in In re Bradberry; National Provincial Bank Ltd v Bradberry (1943) Ch 35 at pp 42-45. Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union [1979] FCA 84 ; (1979) 42 FLR 331 was a case under s 45D of the TPA concerning secondary boycotts. It was, in that case, necessary that the impugned conduct \"would have or be likely to have\" the relevant effect. Consideration was given to whether, on an ex post view, the specified effect had occurred. Deane J at 347 citing Dixon J in Willis v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 22 ; 73 CLR 105 explained: if conduct had run its ordinary course and had not had the specified effect, it would be but rarely that a court would feel justified in disregarding the lesson of the event and finding that while the conduct did not have the specified effect it had been more likely than not that it would have had that effect. Tillmanns [1979] FCA 84 ; 42 FLR 331 was referred to with apparent approval by Gzell J in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) 256 ALR at [1068] although in relation to s 1041E of the Act where the test, whilst similar, is not the same. Materiality: a commercial judgment The question is whether the Informations was information for the purposes of s 674(2) read together with s 677 which would or would be likely to influence common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities and thereby be information which a reasonable person would expect if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price of FMG's shares. The threshold of relevant influence is not, in my opinion, a high one. ASIC, in this case, says that expert assistance is unnecessary for the Court. Senior counsel for ASIC submits that the question of influence for the purposes of s 677 involves primarily a commonsense test for the Court upon a consideration of the primary facts although assistance may be derived from experts who professionally buy and sell shares in large tranches and make investment decisions of the kind contemplated by s 677. I accept this submission. ASIC submits that the fact or likelihood of relevant influence of the Informations is obvious having regard to the nature of this information which individually and together concerned a step forward about the construction of the Project infrastructure, which was integral to FMG's plans. ASIC says that if the three framework agreements were to lead, as both parties evidently intended, to binding build, finance and transfer type agreements, this would be a major advance as it would secure finance and a construction agreement for FMG's total estimated payout costs of $1.85 billion. It adds that the likely influence upon common investors of the Informations is a matter of common sense: it was information which was very significant for the Project and its prospects of being realised, as it was a step forward in arranging for the financing and construction of the rest of its Pilbara infrastructure. ASIC seems ambivalent as to the effect of the Framework Agreements. It says, on the one hand, that they are merely agreements to negotiate and are probably not even enforceable as such. Then on the question of materiality under s 674(2)(c)(ii) ASIC contends that they represent a \"major advance\" if the negotiations proved successful. If the opinions as to the meaning and legal effect of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements contended for by ASIC, that they were either unenforceable or at most were enforceable agreements to negotiate, were the only reasonable opinions open, and, contrary to my finding, FMG should have known this, then, nonetheless, in my opinion FMG was under no obligation pursuant to s 674(2) of the Act to disclose the existence of these agreements, their terms or legal effect. I do not consider, particularly given the highly contingent nature of the Project as at the relevant times, which was known by the market, the details of which are in Part 5, that information that FMG had entered into unenforceable agreements or agreements merely to enter negotiations with CREC, CHEC and CMCC to finance, build and transfer the Project infrastructure would or would be likely to influence common investors in deciding relevantly whether to acquire FMG securities. I will however in due course have regard to the evidence of the experts. ASIC's further and alternative case is that FMG was in breach of s 674(2) by failing to disclose the CREC Information after FMG's notification on 23 August 2004 and the CREC Information, the CHEC Information and the CMCC Information after FMG's notifications on 5 or 8 November 2004. If they are established, ASIC submits that the three post-announcement breaches continue for the entire period until 24 March 2005. However this failure requires to be considered, on ASIC's case, against the assumption of different market information after 23 August 2004 and then after 8 November 2004. On this aspect of its case the influence of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information respectively requires to be evaluated on the assumption that the notifications of August and November 2004 had already been made, and applying a judgment as to what the effect of those notifications was likely to have been, or alternatively what the effect actually was. As I explain later the actual effect is the better starting point. FMG made the following written submissions: (a) Where the issue concerns whether omitted information was required to be disclosed, a consideration of what happened on the disclosure of other information, apart from the omitted information, may provide guidance about the likely impact of the omitted information, and hence its materiality. The following two paragraphs show how ex post information might be relevant. (b) If release of more positive information than the omitted information had no ex post impact , it can be confidently said that the omitted information (if of the same genre but expressing lesser confidence) would not have been or would likely not have been relevant to price or value . (c) Further, even if release of more positive information than the omitted information had an ex post impact , it can also be said, with confidence, that the ex post impact has to be taken into account by the court before drawing any conclusion about whether the omitted information was material. This is because the issue is always whether the \"slice\" of omitted information would have been expected to materially affect or influence or would likely have influenced share price or value . It is impossible to answer that question without discounting out, or taking into account and ignoring, the ex post effect of disclosed information, both information about other issues and information that was allegedly inaccurate or misleading. (d) Thus, ex post information is highly relevant to the real inquiry, which is always whether particular omitted information would have been expected to materially affect or have influenced or would likely have influenced a common investor in securities to buy or sell the securities in the particular company. If ASIC's opinions as to the proper construction and effect of the three framework agreements were the only ones reasonably open then, upon that assumption, there can, in my view, be no doubt that the information provided in the August and November notifications by FMG misstated and overstated the terms and legal effect of each of them. Where earlier notifications had been made to the market that binding agreements to finance, build and transfer the Project infrastructure had been entered into and, assuming such was not the case on any reasonable grounds, then in my opinion, unaided by expert evidence, the effect of these agreements ought to have been notified to the ASX. Assuming that it was the Informations which correctly stated the meaning and legal effect of the three framework agreements and that no other opinion in this respect was reasonably open and this was known or ought to have been known by FMG, then this Information in each case should have been notified. As a matter of commercial commonsense I conclude that common investors who had been earlier told, in effect, not only that binding agreements for the construction of the main infrastructure had been entered into with three major Chinese corporations but that under the agreements these companies would finance the construction, they would likely be influenced in deciding to sell FMG securities if the Informations were released to the market. This, in my opinion, is subject only to it being established that the earlier notifications had a material positive effect on the price or value of FMG's shares. Materiality: the expert evidence The parties filed voluminous expert evidence. ASIC called three experts: (a) Mr Andrew Sisson, Managing Director of Balanced Equity Management Pty Limited, an experienced share portfolio manager who ran his own investment company for 20 years. (b) Mr Reginald Keene, a senior client adviser at Bell Potter Securities with over 40 years experience in the stock market as a stockbroker and analyst who also traded on his own account. (c) Dr Iain Watson, Deputy Dean of the UWA Business School, an expert in business statistics and capital markets research, with extensive publications relevantly in market statistics. FMG's responsive expert report was provided by Gregory Houston, a consulting economist employed by NERA Economic Consulting. Houston did not hold himself out by academic qualification or experience as a statistician. He has used statistics on a number of occasions in the context of economics. He has not published any peer reviewed articles in the field of market statistics. The expert evidence traversed an ex ante approach and an ex post, statistically based, approach. Forrest did not tender any expert evidence. ASIC's experts were, for the purposes of preparing their written reports, provided with a series of questions set out in a letter from ASIC's solicitors, Mallesons Stephen Jaques dated 9 March 2008 (\"Mallesons Letter\"). A copy of this Letter addressed to Sisson is attached under Schedule 'E'. The documents provided to the experts included copies of the three framework agreements and the experts were asked to make various assumptions. The questions posed on an ex ante basis and directed in effect to s 677 and thereby to s 674(2) are numbers 4, 5, 6 and 8. The question posed on an ex post basis directed, in effect to, s 674(2) directly, is number 7. The legal effect of each framework agreement which ASIC's experts were asked to assume was put in the alternative, consistent with its case as to the legal effect of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information respectively. Illustratively, the first assumption in the case of the CREC Framework Agreement was as follows: ... assume that the legal effect of the CREC Framework Agreement was substantially as follows: (a) it did not by its terms oblige CREC to build or transfer a railway facility; (b) it did not by its terms oblige CREC to finance the construction of a railway facility; (c) CREC and Fortescue agreed to develop and, at some later time, negotiate and then agree the matters contained in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement, and then to later enter into a full and detailed build and transfer agreement for a railway facility; (d) if the parties did not in fact agree on the matters contained in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement, then there would have been no binding agreement to build and transfer a railway facility; and (e) if the parties were able to reach agreement on the matters contained in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement, the 'General Conditions' (referred to in clause 1.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement) would have included the terms set out in clause 3.1 of the CREC Framework Agreement. The alternative assumption as to legal effect was set out, in the case of the CREC Framework Agreement, again by way of illustration, at para 34 under Question 4.2 namely that this agreement was \"legally unenforceable\". Broadly, ASIC's case referrable to s 677 concerning the relevant influence of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information respectively proceeds on two alternative assumptions as to what the market knew when this Information variously was released (\"Market Information\") being: (a) the hypothetical disclosure to the market of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information instead of the actual announcements; (b) the hypothetical disclosure to the market of this Information after the actual announcements were made. ASIC's experts were accordingly asked in the Mallesons Letter in effect upon an ex ante basis to consider the question of the relevant s 677 influence alternatively of; (a) the hypothetical notifications of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information alone in August and November 2004; (Questions 4 and 5) (b) the notifications actually made; (Question 6) (c) the hypothetical notification of the CREC Information sometime after the 23 August 2004 notification in relation to the CREC Framework Agreement and the CHEC and CMCC Information some time after the 5 November 2004 notifications actually made by FMG. (Question 8) It is necessary in dealing with the two sets of hypothetical disclosures also to consider the effect of the notifications actually made because this informs the question whether the second set of hypothetical information ought to have been notified. As to para (c) above, I do not agree that an ex ante analysis, by reference to s 677, of the influence of the actual notifications is the appropriate point of comparison. Rather, in my opinion, the comparison should be made with an ex post analysis of the share price in response to the notifications actually made. As ASIC submits, the question of the likely influence of a hypothetical disclosure must necessarily be considered in the circumstances prior to the hypothetical disclosure. The hypothetical release of the Informations is best considered against the circumstance of the actual market response following the August and November notifications. This was addressed by Question 7 of the Mallesons Letter, where ASIC's experts were then asked in effect upon an ex post basis to consider whether the actual notifications made in August and November 2004 had an actual effect on the price or value of FMG securities. ASIC's experts were also asked, by a letter from ASIC's solicitors dated 25 February 2009 to provide their further opinion, again in effect upon an ex ante basis, upon yet another varied assumption, namely whether their opinions would alter if they each made no assumptions as to the legal effect of the Framework Agreements and that questions 4.1, 5.1 and 8 in the Mallesons Letter asked them to consider the terms of the relevant framework agreements rather than their legal effect. I do not consider this area of expert opinion to be relevant. ASIC's case is founded upon its two alternative interpretations of the legal effect of the framework agreements: first that the agreements are merely agreements to negotiate; second, that they are of no legal effect. These, together, constitute the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information respectively. The opinions of the experts as to the materiality of the terms of the framework agreements and their own assessments of their legal effect are not relevant. I will however deal later with evidence given by Keene during cross-examination on this point for the sake of completeness. Dr Watson purported to give expert opinion evidence on an ex ante basis on the s 677 questions. I do not regard him as qualified to do so and have disregarded that part of his evidence. Both Sisson and Keene were experienced as common investors. They were the only expert witnesses who had actual experience in making investments. By letter dated 13 October 2008, FMG's solicitors, Clayton Utz, asked Houston a series of questions concerning the materiality of FMG's disclosures and non-disclosures of information as pleaded in the statement of claim. He was asked the ex post questions whether: the August announcements had a positive material effect upon the price of FMG's shares the November announcements had a positive material effect upon the price of FMG's shares. These questions corresponded to the ex post questions put to the ASIC experts at Question 7 of the Mallesons Letter. Houston was also asked by Clayton Utz whether the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information was \"information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. \" That question was asked in the language of s 674(2)(c)(ii), not s 677. Houston was not asked whether this was information which would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities, which is the language of s 677. Houston said in his report at pages 36 and 82 in effect, that he had not assessed on an ex ante basis whether the hypothetical disclosure of the CREC Information in August 2004 and then the CREC Information and the CHEC Information in November 2004 would have been likely to have influenced common investors, if disclosed either before or after the actual notifications. Specifically, he said that in his opinion \"it is of no probative value to assess whether disclosure of the CREC Information between 19 and 23 August would have had a material effect on FMG's share price\". He therefore limited his assessment to whether or not the disclosure of the CREC Information would have had a material effect on FMG's share price had it been disclosed at the same time or after the statements that were actually made by FMG on 23 August. In cross-examination, Houston also said he assumed that disclosure of the CREC Information would have had a positive effect, albeit a less positive effect than what was actually disclosed by FMG on 23 August 2004. His approach to the CHEC and CMCC Information was the same. Obviously the statistical evidence by itself could not resolve the question on an ex ante basis of whether the relevant influence would or would likely arise for the purposes of s 677. It obviously could not address the CREC Information, CHEC Information and CMCC Information in the context of the question whether this Information respectively would have or likely would have given rise to the relevant influence on common investors for the purposes of s 677. In my opinion the resolution of the question upon an ex ante approach involves a matter of judgment, informed by commercial common sense and, if necessary, by evidence from persons who have practical experience in buying and selling shares and in the workings of the stock market. In his supplementary report Watson said that, had he been asked to consider the materiality of any hypothetical \"corrective disclosure\", he would have indicated that it was not possible to determine any test based on statistical significance retrospectively in this situation as Houston had attempted to do. In his opinion, the only way to estimate the significance of such a hypothetical situation would be via a controlled behavioural finance experiment. The statistical evidence of Watson and Sisson for ASIC and Houston for FMG, which approached, on an ex post basis, whether the actual notifications by FMG in August and November had an actual effect on the price or value of FMG's securities, was complex in expression and ultimately dependent for its weight upon subsidiary judgments I would have been required to make as to methodology and relevant statistical parameters always subject to differential data inputs. A compounding difficulty was that each approached the question in different ways. One of the statistical parameters was daily volume weighted average prices (VWAP). The VWAP is calculated by taking the total traded value of shares over the day, a figure obtained by multiplying the volume of each trade with its price, and dividing that figure by the total volume of shares traded. The contest as to inputs for the competing statistical analyses included use of VWAP as against use of closing prices; the percentage change in VWAP to reach a 95% confidence level as to causation; the correct control periods to be used in the analyses; the existence or not of an efficient market in FMG securities; the appropriate market model to be employed; whether or not there was a structural break in the available data occurring in October 2004; the correlation between market index returns and FMG's share price returns; the use of a Beta of 1 or less than 1; one day returns as against two day returns; and the appropriate percentage movement in the closing price of FMG shares sufficient to be regarded as statistically significant by comparison with random chance. There was more, however this brief description of what consumed hundreds of pages of expert reports on these matters illustrates the immense difficulties in arriving at any helpful conclusion. I would, were it necessary, where there was conflict in the evidence have preferred the evidence of Watson. He held, in this field, greater expertise. There was, importantly, a consensus in the evidence of Watson, Sisson and Houston that the price movements in FMG's shares following the November notifications were statistically significant although Houston differed from the others as to the cause of this. I do not think it is necessary that I reach positive conclusions as to the expert evidence where it was in conflict. In my view the evidence available on an ex ante basis going to s 677 influence, supported by the relevant statistical evidence on an ex po st basis where there was a broad consensus, is sufficient to resolve the issue of materiality for the purposes of s 674(2). Each of Watson and Houston and, to an extent, Sisson in relation to his responsive report, was subject to unusually strong criticism. Their professional honesty in different ways was questioned. Much has been written in the closing submissions of ASIC and FMG in this respect. I do not accept these criticisms. I have no hesitation in concluding that each of them did their best, in trying circumstances, to discharge their professional obligations, as independent experts, to the Court. I do not propose to analyse at length the strident criticisms made of them. I was grateful for their attempted assistance even if, for the reasons I have given, I did not find much of their evidence of actual assistance. The ex ante expert evidence I will now deal in turn with the three scenarios contemplated by the expert evidence concerning relevant s 677 influence. I will then consider the materiality of the hypothetical notification of the actual terms of the agreements. I have already concluded that this is not relevant to ASIC's case but it was the subject of evidence and submissions and particularly so by FMG which pressed it as of some importance. The three scenarios are: (a) hypothetical notification to the market of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information instead of the actual announcements; (b) the notifications actually made; (c) the hypothetical notification of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information at some time after the announcements actually made; Hypothetical disclosure CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information instead of the actual notifications (Questions 4 and 5) I will adopt, for these purposes, Sisson's definition for \"market\" as effectively a term for the aggregation of common investors. Sisson gave detailed consideration to the market's understanding of the factors influencing the value of FMG's shares as at 23 August 2004. He said the company's prospects depended entirely on whether it could bring to fruition plans to export iron ore from its Pilbara permits He referred to the high cost of the infrastructure, the opposition of the existing iron ore miners BHP and Rio Tinto to the Project, the difficulty in raising the very large amounts of finance required for the infrastructure investment, and the low market capitalisation of less than $100m which meant that it would not be realistic for FMG to raise the amount of money to finance a project worth over $1000m conventionally through a mixture of equity and debt. He said the management of FMG was incentivised to talk up the chance of the Project proceeding so as to increase the share price, thereby increasing the prospects of raising equity capital to allow the Project to proceed. He concluded that the market applied a high degree of scepticism to FMG's management statements as they were seen as being imbued with a component of self-serving optimism. Sisson concluded that the signing of any agreement, no matter how conditional, with a major state-owned Chinese company was of significance to a speculative mining company such as FMG. He was of the opinion that information concerning the existence or any legal effect of the CREC Framework Agreement would have had some influence on common investors in considering whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. He took this view based upon each of ASIC's assumptions as to the legal effect of this agreement. However, given the conditionality of the agreement he was unsure as to whether that influence would have been sufficiently material to have caused an ordinary and rational investor to decide to actually acquire FMG shares or to have had a material effect on the FMG share price. He expressed the same opinion in relation to the information concerning the existence of or any legal effect of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. Accordingly, Sisson graded the influence in question. The effect of this evidence properly understood is, I think, that Sisson's opinion did not extend to concluding that the CREC Information would or would likely have influenced common investors in deciding to acquire FMG shares. He referred to the influence on investors \"in considering whether to acquire ...\". This is the wrong question. The relevant influence is that bearing upon common investors, relevantly, \" deciding whether to acquire or dispose of\" FMG securities. Influence which is productive of mere consideration but no decision either way is not the relevant statutory influence. This is so because the primary question under s 674(2) is whether the information is such that a reasonable person would expect it to have a material effect on \"the price or value \" of FMG securities. Information which would or would likely influence common investors merely to consider whether to buy or sell FMG securities but not decide to buy or sell could never be expected to have a material effect on the price or value of those securities. As I have explained earlier, Houston's analysis of the hypothetical and actual notifications was based on the question whether the notifications would be expected to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities, but he did not do so by considering the terms of s 677 which is interpretative of s 674(2) namely, whether they would, or would be likely to, influence common investors to buy or sell securities. Notwithstanding, I will set out a summary of his evidence. Watson, by comparison, made no findings as to the materiality of the effect of these potential disclosures on FMG's share price as he was not asked to do so. That is, he was not asked the direct question whether the disclosures of the CREC, CHEC or CMCC Information would be likely to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's shares had it been disclosed some time after 9.37 am on 23 August 2004 or 8.10 pm on 5 November 2004. In relation to whether information that was not disclosed to the market would be likely to have had a material effect on the price of a company's shares, Houston made a judgment informed by price changes following the disclosures actually made by FMG. While he recognised that the obligations of a company to notify information involved an ex ante assessment of whether new information is likely to be price sensitive, an after-the-fact indication of whether omitted information was likely to have been price sensitive could be gained by analysing whether or not it had a material effect on a company's share price at the time it was finally disclosed. This is because the change in a company's share price at the time a corrective disclosure is made provides some indication as to how the company's share price may have changed had the relevant information been released at the time it first became known. In order to conduct such an assessment, Houston contended that it would be necessary to consider contextual factors to determine whether investors may have reacted differently to the relevant information at different points in time. Houston attempted to apply this framework to determine whether disclosure of the 'CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information' respectively or information on the terms of the framework agreements would be likely to have resulted in a share price movement that was materially different from that which was observed on 9 November 2004. He contended that, in order for the 'CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information' to have been material to FMG's share price, two conditions must hold: (a) the statements made by FMG on 23 August, 5 November and 9 November 2004 must have had a positive material effect on the price of FMG shares; and (b) investors must have held the view that information as to the nature and legal effect of the agreements was sufficiently important for there to have been a material difference between the price increase actually observed in response to the statements made by FMG and that which would be likely to have been observed had the 'CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information' been disclosed. Houston concluded that: (a) the disclosures made by FMG on 23 August 2004 did not have a positive material effect on the price of its shares. By way of corollary, there would not have been a material difference between the price increase that was observed on 23 August 2004 and that which would be likely to have been observed had the 'CREC Information' been disclosed on this date; and (b) the totality of the disclosures made by FMG between 5 and 9 November did have a positive material effect on the price of its shares. It follows that it is possible that disclosure of the 'CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information' may have resulted in a materially different price increase than that observed on 9 November 2004, had it been disclosed on or before that date. It is also possible that it may not have resulted in a materially different price increase than that observed on 9 November 2004. Whilst his conclusion was based in part on his statistical evidence I have later in these reasons accepted his view, and ultimately Watson's view, that there was no statistical significance attaching to the price movements on 23 Aug 2004. I accept as logical that the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information, which was far less positive than the actual announcement made on that date, would not likely have had a material effect on FMG's shares. I do not regard his evidence as to the possibilities open following the November notifications as of any assistance. In Keene's opinion, and holding the assumption that the CREC Framework Agreement was not a binding agreement to finance, build and transfer a railway facility, information concerning the existence or any legal effect of the CREC Framework Agreement would have constituted information concerning FMG that would have influenced or would have been likely to have influenced, common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. He said that the agreement nevertheless had similarities to a memorandum of understanding, indicating a willingness of two parties to do a deal. As such, he said, it was still a step forward in the possible development of FMG's iron ore resources, and was better than no agreement of any kind whatsoever. He concluded that the information would have influenced common investors in deciding whether to acquire FMG shares. He said he did not believe it would have influenced common investors to dispose of FMG shares. His answer to the question of s 677 influence did not change on holding ASIC's alternative assumption that the CREC Framework Agreement was legally unenforceable. Keene's opinion on the s 677 influence of the information concerning the existence or any legal effect of the CHEC Framework Agreement and CMCC Framework Agreement, and his reasons for holding that opinion, were the same as he expressed in relation to information concerning the CREC Framework Agreement. I do not accept Keene's opinion in these respects. It was merely assertive. It also suffered from the vice that he obviously was influenced by his own characterization of the framework agreements as having \"... similarities to a memorandum of understanding\". He had not been asked to provide his opinion against his own assumptions as to the effect of the agreements. That he did so means that this aspect of his evidence was not helpful. For these reasons, I gained no assistance on this question under the first scenario from the experts and remain of the opinion I reached based in commercial commonsense that the CREC Information in August 2004 and the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information in November 2004 would not likely have influenced common investors in FMG's shares in deciding to acquire these. I therefore find for the purposes of s 674(2) that the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information was not information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. Notifications actually made by FMG on 23 August, 5 and 9 November 2004 (Question 6) I have taken the trouble of dealing with the parties' submissions as to the ex ante likely influence under s 677, if any, of the actual notifications made. However, as I have explained this is not the preferred approach where there is evidence of what actually occurred to FMG's share price following the actual notifications. FMG's obligations of continuous disclosure under s 674(2) after the actual notifications were made, which is ASIC's alternative category of alleged contravention, is best evaluated against the actual market information available to FMG, its directors and officers at that time and thereafter rather than indulging in an ex ante analysis in relation to prospective events when those events, namely the notifications, have actually occurred. Sisson said, in relation to the August notifications, that the 23 August Letter and 23 August Media Release could in combination be expected to have influenced, or have been likely to have influenced, common investors in deciding whether to acquire FMG securities. Indeed, in his opinion, the influence of this information would have been so strong that it could reasonably be expected to have had a material positive effect on the share price: Sisson, main report at [85], [86]. He said, in relation to the August notification, that the effect of the two releases must be considered in the context of the market understanding that existed prior to their release. He said the key part of the 23 August Letter was the statement referring to FMG's entry into a binding contract with CREC to build and finance the railway. Sisson emphasised the significance of the words \"binding\" and \"finance\". He said that the suggestion of a binding arrangement which included the provision of finance for infrastructure development on deferred payment terms would be seen as highly significant. Sisson also pointed to significant statements in the media release relating to the binding nature of the agreement, CREC's assumption of risk, the fixing of price, the financing of the rest of the Project in a plain vanilla manner, and to the agreement being a catalyst to propel the Project into real-time construction, project financing and project commencement stages. Sisson also mentioned that there would still be uncertainties in the minds of investors following these releases. He said the market would be seeking clarification whether CREC was funding 100% of the railway and whether the \"fixed price\" was definitively determined. Finally, Sisson said the fact that on Friday 20 August 2004 FMG requested their shares be placed in trading halt pending the announcement is further testament that the announcement could be expected to have a material impact on the price of FMG's shares. In relation to the November notifications, Sisson again emphasised the significance of the words \"binding\" and \"finance\" in relation to the design, finance and build arrangements being extended to CHEC and CMCC. He referred to the statement in FMG's letter to the ASX that \"the CREC structure was substantially in the same form as the new contracts\", which allowed \"any previous comments on the CREC contract to be extended to the new contracts\" and also allowed comments on the new contracts to be extended to CREC. He noted that the comment that the terms and conditions place the \"majority project risk with the construction party\" sat a little oddly with the statement on 23 August that \"CREC will take full risk under a fixed price arrangement\". Sisson also said that FMG's comment that the payment terms for the 90% balance are structured on a staged basis effectively providing a finance facility for this substantial portion of the total project cost. This balance is being quickly filled by customer prepayments and we are actively pursuing further joint ventures was significant because it extended the arrangement to substantially all of the project and clarified that the medium-term vendor finance would cover 90% of the project value. Further, Sisson said the statement that the balance is quickly being filled by customer prepayments (which had been stated elsewhere to be $66m) also implied that the balance of the funding burden was not excessive, which could be expected to be positive to the share price and value of FMG as it sheltered shareholders from the prospect of a large capital raising. Sisson also mentioned that the announcement in the 8 November Letter of the signing by two Australian companies of memoranda of understanding with CHEC and CMCC to create a relationship to be used in the FMG project was not significant in its own right because the nature of memoranda of understanding is not sufficiently definitive or binding to be treated as highly significant; and that the further details about financing given in the letter were largely a repetition of details in the previous announcement, other than the clarification that the price of the \"fixed price contract\" was not yet fixed. Sisson concluded that the information in the three documents released in November together constituted information concerning FMG that would have influenced, or would have been likely to have influenced, common investors in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG shares. Sisson however conceded in cross-examination that: (a) commonsense and business experience would have told investors who read the 23 August announcements that the building and financing of the rail, which was announced, must be contingent upon a conclusion that a viable project is likely, which answer depended on the outcome of the DFS; (b) it was \"not very convincing\" to investors for an announcement to be made on funding the rail alone, when the prospects of a viable mine were still uncertain and the DFS had just begun; (c) the announcement about funding was insufficient for investors to change their valuation of the company in a material way - by simply announcing funding for the rail alone, when it was not known whether the mine is going to come into operation; These important factors do not appear to have been factored by Sisson into his first report where he describes the provision of finance as \"highly significant\". His opinion as to the likely influence of the 23 August notification appears to place undue weight on the market's perceived reliance on the announcement of funding of the railway. This criticism does not however, in my opinion, apply to the November notifications which concerned not merely the railway but all three components of the Project infrastructure. Sisson also conceded in cross-examination that investors' perceptions of the likelihood of the Project succeeding really changed very little after 23 August 2004. He conceded that the market evidence showed that the assumed probability of the Project proceeding was not as great in that first six weeks of market trading as they would have been, in his mind. He said his opinion \"about the likelihood of (the Project) being built was changed by the events or by the notifications of 23 August (2004) perhaps more than the share market price indicated that the broader market had its opinion\". He also said that he did not necessarily want his view of the chance of the Project proceeding to be equated with the market's view of the chance of it succeeding. He said these were two different things to consider. He confirmed that his perception might well be different from the market's perception, and said that any investor, at all times, has a perception of companies which is different from other people in the market, and that this was what the market is all about. These concessions made by Sisson serve to highlight that where evidence is available of what actually occurred this is to be preferred to an ex ante analysis. Keene was of the opinion that there would be a relevant s 677 influence in respect to both the actual August and November notifications. Keene said that both notifications made by FMG on 23 August contained information that should have triggered interest in FMG shares. He said the August notifications were clearly the most significant made to date by the company. It was significant that CREC, China's largest construction group, had entered into a binding agreement to build and finance the railway component, which was the largest individual component of the entire project. It was also significant that the Chinese construction group was involved as China was clearly FMG's target market for its iron ore. Further, the chief financial officer Catlow stated that the rest of the project then could be financed in a \"plain, vanilla\", or conventional, way. In relation to the November notifications, Keene emphasised that the two new arrangements announced represented a further breakthrough for FMG and a new milestone in the development of the Project. There were now three Chinese government-owned corporations committed to the finance, construction and transfer of the entire Project infrastructure. I am not persuaded by the evidence of Keene in respect to the 23 August notification. Sisson, on the other hand, made appropriate concessions as to this. I remain of the opinion that the August announcement would not likely have influenced common investors in deciding to acquire FMG's shares. My analysis later in these reasons of the actual price movement on 23 August 2004 and the common evidence that these were not statistically significant assists me in maintaining my earlier opinion. The disclosures made in November included the news that the Chinese Contractors had entered into MOUs with Australian contractors. FMG submits that the information contained within the 9 November announcement to the effect that ThyssenKrupp and BGC had entered into MOUs with the Chinese Contractors was and, ex ante , was always likely to be, a matter of great significance to the market. It says that the clear majority of media reports at the time attributed the increase in FMG's share price after the opening of trade on 9 November to the MOUs and therefore, by inference, not to the news of FMG's contracts. Sisson said that it was not possible to be precise about how much importance to ascribe to one class of information or the other; it was a matter of judgment. In his view, the news of the MOUs was of significance, but not as significant as the agreement between FMG and the Chinese Contractors. He went on to profess a high degree of confidence in his opinion. FMG submits that in the face of the contradictory media reporting as to the cause of the price surge, and having regard to the scepticism in the media that attached to the announcement of 5 November including as to FMG's reserves and other aspects of the Project, Sisson's view is absurd. Keene accepted that the market would have been impressed by the announcement of these two memoranda of understanding with the eminent contracting companies, but he too thought it was subsidiary to the contracts announced on 5 November 2004. I do not accept FMG's submission. The MOUs were dependent upon and subsidiary to the framework agreements. They added to the influence bearing on common investors but were not, in my opinion, likely to have been the main cause of the share price movements. I accept the opinions of Sisson and Keene on this issue. I accept that common investors reading the notifications of 5 and 9 November would have understood that the agreements were contingent on the completion of a feasibility study and upon FMG proving sufficient quantity of resource of the requisite quality to render the Project economically viable and they would have known that the agreements contemplated more formal detailed construction agreements. They would have understood that the agreements did not establish a price, and that the parties would be working within the DFS to actually set a firm price. They would have understood that the security for the finance that the Chinese Contractors were to provide had not yet been established because it would only be established when the value of the works under the agreements were established, and when FMG had found sufficient iron ore in the ground to the value of the works. They would have understood that further agreements were going to be entered into in respect of the security position. Watson in cross-examination accepted all of these propositions. Nonetheless the price movements on 9 November and the ensuing days were, in my view, of comparative significance as was the volume of shares traded. I will return to this in more detail below. I am satisfied, on an ex ante basis, that the actual notifications would or would likely have had the relevant influence under s 677. I am therefore satisfied for the purposes of s 674(2)(c)(ii) that the announcement constituted information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. However, as I observed at the beginning of this section I do not regard this analysis as of much assistance. Hypothetical release of CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information after the actual notifications (Question 8) As I observed earlier an ex ante analysis of the likely influence of the actual notifications followed by an ex ante analysis of the likely influence of the hypothetical information is not the preferred approach. Whether FMG ought to have announced the hypothetical information following the actual notifications made in August and November, is better informed by considering, on an ex post basis, the actual effect on the FMG share price following the actual announcements and against that market information, and then considering, on an ex ante basis, the s 677 influence, if any, of the hypothetical notifications. On and after 9 November, FMG, through its officers would have known what the share price movements were and would have been in a position to evaluate the likely reasons for those. I have approached this question therefore by a consideration of the statistical evidence as to the actual effect on FMG's share price of the notifications made, set out below, together with the ex ante evidence of the experts set in that context. As to the statistical evidence relating to the actual effect of the August and November notifications I am satisfied that the notifications made on 23 August did not have any statistically significant effect on the FMG share price, whereas those made on 5 and 8 November did have a statistically significant effect on the FMG share price. The reasons for so finding are set out later in these reasons. In relation to the hypothetical disclosure of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information at sometime after the notifications actually made, ASIC's experts were only asked to give their opinions on the assumption that the agreements were in substance agreements to negotiate. They were not asked for their opinions on the premise that the agreements were \"legally unenforceable\" as had been asked in Questions 4.2 and 5.2 in relation to the hypothetical disclosure of the Informations instead of the actual notifications. Sisson stated in relation to the hypothetical CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information released after the November notifications that disclosure to common investors would have influenced, or would have been likely to have influenced, common investors in deciding whether to buy or sell FMG shares. It would thereby be expected by a reasonable person to have had a material effect on the price of FMG shares as the removal of the original impression would have reversed part or all of the initial positive impact. However, Sisson said in his supplementary report that an ex post analysis would have considered the reality that in the first six weeks after the release of 23 August 2004, and excluding the first morning of trading, the actual share price increase was modest and that therefore the negative share price effect of the hypothetical subsequent disclosure would be unlikely to be material. I accept this opinion in relation to the period prior to the November notifications. In ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199 at the time of both alleged continuous disclosure contraventions there was a negative perception in the market place in relation to the shares of the holding company due to its asbestos liability. Gzell J noted at [507] that the reasonable person would think on receipt of the information concerning the covenants and indemnities that the company's asbestos claim liability had been controlled and that the blight upon its share price had been removed. In relation to the second set of information, his Honour noted that the severing of the company's connection to its asbestos liability was positive information and likely to reduce negative sentiment in the market regarding the company's shares: [1121]. The position in relation to market sentiment in ASIC v Macdonald was thus the opposite of the situation that exists in the present case, following the November notification where the market held a positive view of FMG and where the tenor of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information was negative. I note that Gzell J found both contraventions to have been made out ([507], [537], [1136]) without analysis of quantitative or statistical information. Nor did his Honour refer to the question posed by s 677 and its equivalent under the former regime, s 1001D, namely whether the omitted information would, or would be likely to, influence persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of the company's securities. Instead, his Honour referred to the direct question under ss 674(2) and 1001A(2) whether a reasonable person would expect the information, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of the shares. Notwithstanding that, it would appear that the question under ss 677 and 1001D, namely, whether the information would have had the relevant influence on investors, would have been answered affirmatively by Gzell J on the basis that, as found by his Honour at [507] and [1121], the reduction and severing of the company's possible connection to asbestos claims was likely to reduce negative sentiment. Keene stated that the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information would have been seen as a negative announcement compared to the actual notifications made by FMG in August and November. This information would have led to downward pressure on FMG's share price and induced some investors to sell. I accept the evidence of Sisson and also Keene but in his case only with respect to the hypothetical release of the Information after the November notifications had been made. It accords with my own independent judgment. It necessarily rests on the conclusions to which I have come that in respect to the November notifications a reasonable person would have expected them to have a positive material effect on the price of FMG's shares but that such effect would not have been expected in respect to the August notification. I therefore find that the CREC Information: (a) If released after the actual notification to the ASX on 23 August and prior to the November notifications would not, or would not have been likely to have influenced, persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. Accordingly, the CREC Information was not during that period information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's securities for the purposes of s 674(2). (b) If released after the actual notifications to the ASX in November would have, or would have been likely to have influenced, persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. Accordingly, the CREC Information was during that period information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's securities for the purposes of s 674(2). I find that the CHEC and CMCC Information, if released some time after the actual notifications were made in November, was information which would have, or would have been likely to have influenced, persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. Accordingly, the CHEC and CMCC Information was during that period information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's securities for the purposes of s 674(2). Hypothetical release of the actual framework agreements or their terms Keene was cross-examined about the materiality of the CREC Framework Agreement. He was asked to ignore ASIC's assumptions as the legal effect of the agreement. He was then asked to assume that FMG had released a copy of the CREC Framework Agreement to the ASX along with the 23 August Letter and the 23 August Media Release. Keene agreed that: (a) He would have expected analysts in the marketplace and others to have read the agreement together with the releases. (b) If participants in the marketplace read the Recitals, they would have understood that the parties had entered into an agreement, and that would have impressed the market as a very positive step, because it would have indicated to the reader that the parties intended to enter into an agreement and would be regarded by the investor as a \"very positive step\" and a \"matter of commercial substance\". (c) Clauses 1.1 and 1.2 would have provided the investor with comfort that the parties have entered into an agreement on the terms set out in clause 1.1; an investor reading clause 1.2 would be provided with comfort again that these parties have entered into an agreement upon the terms set out in clause 2; similarly for paragraph 3, which made provision for the financing of the project. (d) Clause 5 would have indicated to the reader that the parties intended the agreement to be binding upon verification by their respective boards, which would have provided the investor a great deal of comfort that the parties intended to carry out this agreement (e) Clause 7 would have provided a great deal of comfort to the investor that the parties did indeed intend to carry out the agreement and, if necessary, enter into further, more detailed agreements consistent with this one. Keene then agreed with the proposition put to him that if the CREC Framework Agreement had been released to the market together with the 23 August Letter and the 23 August Media Release, the market reaction in terms of movement in the share price would have been substantially the same as actually occurred on 23 August 2004. Keene also agreed that his answer would apply equally to the notifications made in November 2004, if he disregarded the legal effect put forward by ASIC. It follows that Keene's opinion as to the likely effect on the FMG share price of what he viewed as the commercial substance of the framework agreement was that it would have had the same effect as FMG's notifications to the ASX as to its legal effect. However, the contest in this case does not lie between those two opinions. ASIC's case is not that FMG ought to have disclosed the actual framework agreements. Keene's opinion however discloses that his view as to the commercial substance of the framework agreements did not accord with ASIC's opinions as to their legal effect which he had been asked to assume for the purposes of his opinion. It reflects his appreciation that the market understood that FMG's disclosures that they were binding agreements sat in a qualified and contingent context where there was, even by March 2005 no certainty that the agreements would proceed because there was no certainty that the Project would proceed. The distance between Keene's view of how the market would regard the actual terms of the framework agreements and ASIC's view as to the legal effect of these is telling. Accordingly, Keene's opinion, in this respect, does not go to the question of the materiality or otherwise of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information for the purposes of s 674(2). The ex post statistical evidence: effect of the actual notifications in August and November (Question 7) 23 August notification: the facts On Friday 20 August 2004 a trading halt was put in place over FMG's shares by the ASX at the request of FMG, pending the release of the notifications that were to be made by the company on 23 August 2004. No trading in FMG's shares occurred on 20 August 2004. Trading reopened at the commencement of normal trading on Monday 23 August 2004 at 10:00 am, after the release of FMG's notification at 9:37 am. The closing price of FMG's shares on 23 August 2004 was 59 cents, an increase of 7.3% over the previous trading day, 19 August 2004, when the closing price was 55 cents. The VWAP on 23 August 2004 was 61.62 cents, an increase of 11.0% from the VWAP of 55.5 cents on 19 August 2004. The volume of FMG shares traded on 23 August 2004 was 2,569,182 shares which was approximately an eight-fold increase over the trading volume of 19 August 2004 when the volume was 323,199 shares. A 'Course Of Sales' document in relation to trades for FMG on 23 August 2004 discloses the following: (a) the opening price open was 65c (b) a number of trades went through at that price at the same time - 10.02:13.94: (c) there were 22 trades involving 7 buyers and 15 sellers; (d) the price 20 seconds after opening marked the high for the day. (e) one broker bought the first to eighth trade: first at 67c-70c and then back to 67c that broker alone took the price from 65c - 67c - 69c - 67c the next broker took the price from 67c - 66c - 65c (f) Within 90 seconds of the opening price, sellers could not get the price of the previous sale. (g) The next price of 66c was not reached again for the day. The next price of 65c was the peak for the day from that point on. (h) The price was pushed up from the open price to 70c on very small volumes with a very small number of buyers. In fact the share price moved from: 65 cents to 67 cents on 10,000 shares with a value of $6,700 67 cents to 69 cents on 1,600 shares with a value of $1,104 69 cents to 70 cents on 8,400 shares with a value of $5,880 The share price therefore moved from the opening price of 65 cents to 70 cents on only 20,000 shares bought by two buyers at a total cost of $13,684.00. Accordingly the opening price returned within 3 minutes of reaching 70 cents. The rise from 65 cents to 70 cents seems of little significance in context. During the day it fell back to 59 cents. ASIC pointed to the fact that there were 278 sale and purchase transactions on 23 August 2004 and that the next highest volume of transactions prior to then was 58 on 2 August 2004. Further there were at least one million more shares traded on 23 August 2004 (2,569,182) than on the next highest trading day since the beginning of the 2004 financial year which was on 29 July 2004 (1,644,698). Further there were generally less than 500,000 shares traded per day prior to 23 August 2004 during the 2004/2005 financial year. I do not think much turns on these statistics. Section 674(2) is concerned, in effect, with price or value sensitive information. The number of trades and the volume of shares traded are relevant in the overall mix of factors concerning materiality but the most telling factor, in my opinion, is the actual price movement which occurred on 23 August 2004. Forrest's written closing submissions assert that the price settled at \"pre-open\" for FMG's shares on 23 August 2004 was 65 cents which was 10 cents higher than the closing price on 19 August 2004. However, there was no evidence as to what \"pre-open\" meant or the time when it was fixed or how the opening price was arrived at. The actual notification was made at 9.37 am on 23 August 2004, a little over 20 minutes before the market opened. I am not able to draw inferences one way or the other as to how the opening price of 65 cents was arrived at against a closing price of 55 cents on the last trading day, 19 August 2004. This is of critical importance because ASIC calculated VWAP for 23 August 2004 as 61.62 cents representing an increase of 11% on the last available VWAP from 19 August 2004 of 55.5 cents. Furthermore, I note that of the 2,569,182 shares traded on 23 August 2004 only a little over 500,000 were transactions at or above the opening price. 23 August notification: the experts Watson and Sisson, who purported to give expert statistical evidence, on the one hand and Houston, on the other, adopted different approaches for assessing whether information that was disclosed could be said to have had either an 'actual effect' or a 'material effect' on the price of a company's shares. Each of ASIC's experts was asked whether, in his opinion, the 23 August 2004 notification had an actual effect on the price or value of FMG's shares. Each of them answered the question in the affirmative. In answering the question, they considered whether the movement in the price of the shares on 23 August 2004 was statistically significant (Watson), significant (Sisson) or material (Keene). Houston was asked whether, in his opinion, the allegations contained in ASC paras [34] and [91] were correct, namely whether the statements, further or alternatively, the representations or impressions allegedly created by FMG in the disclosures it made on 23 August, 5 November and 9 November 2004 had a positive material effect upon the price of FMG shares. According to the joint expert report of Watson and Houston dated 6 April 2009, each of them conducted an event study to test the movement in the closing price of FMG's shares on 23 August and 9 November 2004, which were defined as 'event days'. Watson tested whether the average return on FMG shares on all relevant event days was different from the average return on FMG shares on non-event days over his chosen sample period, at the 95% level of significance. He conducted, in effect, a test for differences in means. Houston assessed whether the excess return on FMG shares on each individual event day was different from the excess return on FMG shares on non-event days over his chosen sample period at the 95% level of significance. Houston explained in his main report that the excess return was the statistical significance of a share price movement after adjusting for market or industry-wide movements, and that that measurement was a critical criterion for evaluating the materiality of company-specific information. Watson, like the other ASIC experts, had been asked whether any of the information contained within the documents comprising the August and November notifications had had an actual effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. In his main report dated 11 March 2008, Watson stated at [38]-[51] that the announcement of the binding contracts with CREC, CHEC and CMCC to build and finance and transfer the infrastructure and other details as provided in the notification on 23 August and over the period 5 to 9 November had an actual effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. He said in relation to the August notification that: the change in price (return) of FMG's securities (based on price at the close of the day) from the previous trading day was an increase of 7.27%; and the volume of securities traded on that day was also substantially greater than on other trading days. In relation to the November notifications, Watson said: the change in price (return) of FMG's securities (based on price at the close of the day) from the previous trading day was an increase of 35.5 %. This was the change in price from 5 November to 9 November because a trading halt was in place on 5 and 8 November; the volume of securities traded on that day was also substantially greater than on other trading days. Watson said that both the changes in price and volume traded in respect of both the August and November notifications were higher at the 95% significance level based on the t-test and the Mann-Whitney test, which, he said, are tests of differences in means. Watson's main report included a table (Results Table 1) where he set out the results of his tests for differences in means between event and non-event periods. In that table it was stated that the mean of the simple return for FMG was 21.4074 per cent, a figure that was rounded-down subsequently to 21.4 per cent. The table also stated that the daily volume of shares traded for FMG was 5, 449, 479 shares. In cross-examination, Dr Watson stated that he arrived at the mean return figure of 21.4 per cent as the mean of the simple return for FMG on 23 August (the round - up figure of 7.3 per cent) and 9 November (35.5 per cent). He took the same approach in relation to arriving at the mean figure for volume of shares traded. In his oral evidence Watson clarified that when he said in paragraph 43 of his main report that he conducted the t-test and the Mann-Whitney test to compare change in price (returns) and volume \"over the day the information was released compared to the other trading days\", he was not referring to one day, 23 August, but to three days in respect of both the August and November notifications, and that the average return for the three days was 21.4 per cent, a figure his testing deemed to be statistically significant. Watson accepted, in cross-examination, that he had arrived at his conclusions as to the statistical significance of the price changes in August and November, as given in his main report, after incorrectly transferring the test results from his working document to Table 1. When the correct figures were employed he conceded that the t-test and the Mann-Whitney test actually yielded the result that the changes in volume and price were not statistically significant using the 95% benchmark. The joint report of Watson and Houston also stated that Watson had replicated Houston's analysis correcting for what he considered to be errors in Houston's application of the market model in his methodology, and following that test Watson was unable to conclude that the price change observed on 23 August 2004 was statistically significant. However, Watson maintained the disclosures made by FMG did have an actual effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. Houston said he remained unclear how Watson could draw a conclusion as to the actual effect of information on FMG's share price when the relevant price change was not statistically significant. I too remain unclear about how Watson drew that conclusion, but given his concession in cross-examination regarding the materiality of the August and November notifications, I do not need to resolve that issue. Sisson and Houston adopted different approaches for assessing whether information that was disclosed can be said to have had either an 'actual effect' or a 'material effect' on the price of a company's shares. One of the main differences in their approach was that Sisson adopted a range of measures to assess whether information can be said to have had an actual effect on the price of a company's shares whereas Houston assessed whether information can be said to have had a material effect on the price of a company's shares by reference to the change in closing prices. According to their joint expert report, differences in Sisson and Houston's methodological approach caused them to draw different conclusions as to the effect of the disclosures made by FMG on 23 August 2004. Sisson took the view that, on balance, it is reasonable to conclude that the 23 August 2004 disclosures had an actual effect on the price of FMG's shares whereas Houston concluded that the disclosures did not have a material effect. Both Sisson and Houston agreed that the change in the closing price of FMG's shares on 23 August 2004 did not breach their respective thresholds of significance. The difference in their views arose from Sisson's decision to give additional consideration to trading volume and the percentage change in VWAP on that day. Sisson explained in his report that the use of VWAP avoids the possibility that an apparently exceptional price movement resulted from a share price change on relatively light volumes in the last few minutes of the trading day. According to their joint expert report differences in Keene's and Houston's methodology caused them to draw different conclusions as to the effect of the disclosure made by FMG on 23 August, 2004. In Keene's opinion, share price fluctuations do not conform to any mathematical formula and so the price reactions to any announcement can not be calculated with any precision. He therefore adopted a subjective approach to defining a threshold for significance or materiality. He defined a significant movement in any company's share price as a movement from the previous trading day's price greater than plus or minus 10% by reference to the VWAP. He adopted this rule of thumb measure to estimate whether any announcement was significant or material. Houston undertook an analysis of the statistical significance of share price movements relative to the market as a whole, and used this to inform his view of whether information can be said to have had a material effect on a company's share price. Keene concluded that the 23 August 2004 notification had a material effect on the price of FMG's shares whereas Houston concluded that it did not. Sisson accepted in cross-examination that it is not possible to be absolutely definitive whether the 23 August announcement had an actual effect on the price of FMG securities. In a similar vein, Keene agreed in cross-examination that whether or not share price fluctuations are attributable to any announcement cannot be calculated with any precision, that it is a subjective exercise, and that two reasonable investors can come to different views about the matter and neither of them would be wrong. Sisson himself volunteered that \"I'm not going to say that Houston's approach is inappropriate\". He also agreed that it was \"absolutely\" correct to say that approaches to these questions by reasonable people can be different. Sisson did not agree with Keene's approach. Sisson said that it would be quite wrong to assess the impact, likely or actual, of an announcement or the materiality of that impact simply by resort to a rule of thumb of plus or minus 10 per cent. I accept the view of Sisson in this respect. This 'rule of thumb' as the description suggests seems an arbitrary approach without empirical or theoretical support. Watson ultimately came to the view that the price movement on 23 August was not statistically significant or material. I am satisfied, on balance, that the notifications made on 23 August did not have any statistically significant effect on the FMG share price. This supports my earlier conclusion made on an ex ante basis that the notifications would not or would not likely influence common investors for the purpose of s 677 and were accordingly not material for the purposes of s 674(2)(c)(ii). 5 and 9 November 2004 notifications: the facts Further developments had occurred in the Project between 23 August and 9 November 2004. During that time, FMG made a number of announcements to the ASX with positive news about the development of the Project: (a) on 15 September 2004 concerning FMG reaching an agreement with Aboriginal elders representing the indigenous community with the East Pilbara region. Under this agreement, the traditional owners gave approval for FMG to access a highly prospective mineralisation site within a section of FMG's Christmas Creek tenement area. FMG reported that this ethnographically sensitive area had previously been avoided by the company. (b) on 30 September 2004 concerning mineralization results following drilling at FMG's tenement sites within the Chichester Range. FMG reported that it had defined 744 Mt of Pilbara Marra Mamba mineralization with a resource estimate average iron ore grade of 56.4% Fe in ground, and that initial testwork had demonstrated that with beneficiation, the Fe grade of this material increased to in excess of 60%. (c) on 6 October 2004 concerning a formal contract to supply two million tonnes of iron ore per year over 20 years to a Chinese steel company, Hebei Wenfeng Iron & Steel Co Ltd, an arrangement involving a prepayment to FMG of AUD$10 million; (d) on 13 October 2004, concerning a second 20 year contract to supply a Chinese company, Jiangsu Fengli Group Co Ltd, with iron ore together with the announcements of a prepayment of US$20 million by that Chinese company to FMG and purchase by it of 7 million shares in FMG at a value of A$7 million; and (e) 21 October 2004, concerning a 22 year sales agreement with the Ping Xiang Iron & Steel Co. Ltd, a large regional steel mill in China, involving a prepayment amount to FMG of US$20 million. On Friday 5 November 2004, the ASX placed another trading halt over FMG's shares at the written request of FMG. I infer from the facsimile machine imprint at the top of FMG's request letter that the request was received by the Perth branch of the ASX at 10:28 am WST on that day and further, that the trading halt was put in place at around that time. After that, according to the evidence of Walsh, the Company Announcements Platform of the ASX received two announcements dated 5 November 2004 from FMG, which were the 5 November Letter and the 5 November Media Release. The ASX publicly released the 5 November Letter and the 5 November Media Release on its website at 8:10 pm and 8:12 pm respectively. Subsequently, following discussions between Campbell and Huston for FMG and Walsh, FMG sent the 8 November Letter to the ASX on Monday 8 November 2004, and the letter was publicly released by the ASX the next day, 9 November 2004. The ASX lifted the trading halt on Tuesday 9 November 2004 before trading commenced. There was therefore no trading in FMG's shares between approximately 10:28 am (WST) on Friday 5 November 2004 and the opening of trading on Tuesday 9 November 2004. On 5 November 2004 FMG's share price opened at $1.63 and closed at $1.66 on the imposition of the trading halt. It opened at $2.01 on Tuesday 9 November 2004, reaching an intraday high of $2.32 and a low of $1.93 before closing at $2.25. The closing price on 9 November thus increased 35.5% from the closing price of $1.66 from the previous day of trading, 5 November. Sisson pointed out that this increase was the largest percentage closing price movement of any day in the period under examination. Over this period the VWAP rose by 25.1% to $2.07. The volume of shares traded was 8, 329, 775 which was, according to Keene, some 124% higher than the previous record volume traded on 14 October 2004. 5 and 9 November announcements: the experts Sisson and Houston in their written reports reached a similar conclusion as to the effect of the disclosures made by FMG on 5 and 9 November 2004. Sisson concluded that the disclosures had an actual effect on the price of FMG's shares. Houston concluded that the disclosures had a material effect on the price of FMG's shares. Sisson's opinion is that, on the basis of all the available information (a change in closing price of 35.5 per cent, a change in VWAP of 25.1 per cent and trading volume of 8,329,775 shares), the disclosure made by FMG did have an impact on FMG's shares on 9 November 2004. Sisson confirmed that his use of the term \"impact\" could be equated to the term \"actual effect\" but does not necessarily equate to the term \"material effect\" as used by Huston. Houston's opinion is that, on the basis of closing prices alone (i.e. a change in the closing price of 35.5 per cent), the increase in the price of FMG shares observed on 9 November 2004 was of a greater magnitude than was likely to be observed due to random chance, and so was material. It follows that it can be said with a high degree of assurance that this price movement was caused by the release of company-specific information between 5 and 9 November 2004. The question is whether that information included the notifications impugned by ASIC. By a qualitative analysis, Houston concluded that, in the totality of the circumstances, there would have been little or no difference between the price increase observed on 9 November 2004 and that which would be likely to have been observed had the CREC, CHEC and/or CMCC Information or the framework agreements themselves, or a summary of them, been disclosed. FMG submits that Houston's qualitative analysis should be preferred to Sisson's qualitative analysis which assumed that investors would place significant weight on whether or not the agreements in question were binding. It contends that Houston was right in concluding, in effect, that regardless of whether the agreements were to be characterised as binding or not, at the time and in the circumstances which prevailed, including the high contingency of the project, the truly material aspect was that investors would have looked to the commercial impact of the agreements and they would have understood that the Chinese Contractors intended to construct and finance the necessary infrastructure under the funding terms agreed by the parties. FMG then submits that in the result Sisson's analysis assumes too much emphasis on the funding aspect as did his analysis for the August announcement. I do not accept these submissions. Even accepting the highly contingent nature of the Project at that time and that more detailed agreements were yet to be executed the significant fact remains that, following other advances made by FMG since 23 August the November notifications disclosed binding agreements to finance, build and transfer all the major infrastructure for the Project. I accept the evidence of Sisson that the binding nature of the agreements would have been regarded by the market as very significant. Keene again adopted his rule of thumb for share price movement significance as a movement from the previous trading day's price greater than ±10 per cent by reference to the VWAP. He adopts this rule of thumb measure to estimate whether any announcement is significant/material. For reasons which I have given I do not regard this as a reliable approach and certainly not in comparison with the other statistical evidence. Watson also considered that the disclosures had a material effect on the price of shares. The November notifications also included information that MOUs had been entered into between CMCC and each of ThyssenKrupp and BGC and between CHEC and ThyssenKrupp. FMG submits that it is not possible to apportion any statistical significance to the announcement of the CHEC and CMCC agreements on the one hand, and to the announcement of the MOUs with ThyssenKrupp and BGC on the other. Even accepting that this is so, I am of the opinion, and accept the opinion of ASIC's experts that the November announcements concerning the three framework agreements materially contributed to the price movement in FMG's shares. As I earlier found, it was news of these agreements which was likely to have been the main cause of the share price movement and that the MOUs, dependent as they were on the framework agreements, were subsidiary to them. I am satisfied that the 5 November Letter, 5 November Media Release and 8 November Letter together did have a statistically significant effect on the FMG share price. Materiality of the statements in the AFR Article At ASC [124], ASIC pleaded that the statements attributed to CMCC in the AFR Article published on 24 March 2005 had a negative material effect upon the price of FMG's shares. The statements are: (a) CMCC was the lead negotiator for the Chinese construction companies who were to build the infrastructure necessary for the Project; (b) the Chinese construction companies were not prepared to build and finance the Project under the existing arrangements; (c) the Chinese construction companies had not entered binding contracts with the FMG which bound them to fund and construct the infrastructure necessary for the Project; (d) the agreements with the Chinese construction companies lacked key elements such as price, details on the iron ore resource itself, the duties and responsibilities of each party, and time frames; (e) the Chinese construction companies would not pursue the Project unless they could acquire a majority equity interest in it; (f) FMG had not proved that its ore reserves were of sufficient quality and quantity to support a plant capable of processing 45 million tonnes of iron ore annually over an initial 20 years. On 23 March 2005, FMG shares closed at $5.05, and the VWAP of share sales on that day was $5.11. A trading halt was put in place shortly after the opening of trade on 24 March 2005 and was not lifted until 2 hours before the close of trading on 29 March 2005. By the close of trading on 24 March 2005, the share price had fallen to $3.77, and the VWAP was $3.79. On the next trading day, 29 March 2005, FMG's closing share price fell further to $3.70, and the VWAP was $3.65. The closing price continued to fall on 30 and 31 March 2005, and reached $3.10, with a VWAP of $2.99, representing about a 40% fall in the closing price and VWAP over this period. Over 8 million shares were traded between 29 and 31 March, which was a significant volume. The date of publication of the AFR Article is pleaded by ASIC, in effect, as an end date to the alleged s 674(2) contraventions. It is not otherwise relevant to any other part of ASIC's case. ASIC's experts, Sisson, Keene and Watson, were not asked to comment on whether the AFR Article had a negative material effect upon the price of FMG's shares and did not do so in their main reports, although they did comment on this issue in their respective conferral reports with FMG's expert Houston. They did so because Houston analysed the AFR Article and its effect in his report. Houston was not asked by FMG's solicitors to comment on whether the information published in the AFR Article in March 2005 was material to investors. Nonetheless he did so in chapter 4 of his report for the following reasons. In assessing whether the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information was price sensitive, namely. whether that was information which a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities, Houston used a two-stage inquiry: (a) whether FMG's actual August and November announcements had a positive material effect on the price of FMG's securities; and (b) whether there was a material difference between the price increase actually observed in response to the statements made by FMG and that which would be likely to have been observed had the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information been disclosed. In order to complete the second stage of his inquiry, Houston assessed the materiality of the several disclosures made in late March 2005 which were: the AFR Article published on 24 March 2005; an announcement by FMG on 29 March 2005 in response to the AFR Article which included a copy of the CMCC Framework Agreement; and a further announcement on 31 March 2005 which included copies of the CREC and CHEC Framework Agreements. Houston's reason for assessing the materiality of the 24-31 March 2005 disclosures was, as he explained in his report, because the change in a company's share price at the time a corrective disclosure is made provides some indication as to how the company's share price may have changed had the relevant information been released at the time it first became known. In light of his finding that the statements made by FMG on 5 and 9 November 2004 regarding the agreements that it had entered into with CHEC and CMCC had a positive material effect on the price of its shares, Houston assessed whether the information contained in the 24-31 March 2005 disclosures had a negative material effect on the price of FMG's shares at that time. He then considered whether it was possible to estimate the effect that news relating to the nature and legal effect of the framework agreements may have had on FMG's share price given the extent of confounding news contained in the disclosures. Houston's analysis indicated that: (a) the estimated excess return for FMG's share price movement on 24 March 2005 was statistically significant; (b) the estimated excess return for FMG's share price movement on 29-30 March 2005 was statistically significant; and (c) the estimated excess return for FMG's share price movement on 31 March 2005 was not statistically significant. Houston concluded that the 36.8 per cent ($1.86) price drop observed between the close of trading on 24 and 30 March 2005 was of greater magnitude than was likely to be observed due to random chance, and so was material. However, the actual March 2005 share trading table demonstrates that the FMG closing price on 23 March 2005 was $5.05 and that the closing price on 30 March 2005 was $3.19, a difference of $1.86. Accordingly I infer that the date range that Houston intended to refer to in relation to the $1.86 price difference was 23 March to 30 March. The closing price on 24 March was $3.77. Furthermore the opening price on 24 March 2005 was $4.25. The drop to that figure from the closing price on 23 March is not explained. I do not know when the AFR Article was published. I do not know what effect, if any, the time difference across Australia made to investor reaction to the AFR Article prior to the opening price of $4.25 being fixed. Nonetheless Houston said it followed that it can be said with a high degree of assurance that this price movement was caused by the release of company specific information between these two dates. He concluded that the information contained in the AFR Article and FMG's subsequent response had a negative material effect on its share price. In relation to the 2.8 per cent ($0.09) price drop observed on 31 March 2005, Houston said it was not of a greater magnitude than was likely to be observed due to random chance, and so was not material. He said it followed that it cannot be said with a reasonable degree of assurance that this price movement was caused by the release of company specific news on that day. He therefore concluded that the disclosure on 31 March 2005 did not have a material effect on the price of FMG's shares. However he concluded, and Watson agreed, that given the extent of confounding news contained in the AFR Article, and FMG's subsequent disclosure on 29 March 2005, there is no systematic or rigorous method for separating the effect of each item of news that would be capable of supporting a statistically robust conclusion as to the materiality of any one of them. Houston's qualitative assessment of media and analyst commentary at the time of the 24-30 March 2005 disclosures suggested in his view that uncertainty created by CMCC's statements in relation to both FMG's resource base and sales contracts meant that these disclosures may well have been the principal cause of the drop in FMG's share price between 24 March and 30 March 2005. However Houston said it was not possible to state with any reasonable degree of confidence that the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information was material to investors. Keene agreed with Houston that the information contained in the AFR Article had a negative material effect on the price of FMG shares. He also agreed with Houston that it is not possible to determine whether the price drop that occurred on 24 March 2005 and between 29 and 30 March 2005 was caused by news of the legal effect of the framework agreements. Keene also agreed with Houston that the disclosure made by FMG in relation to the CREC and CHEC Framework Agreements on 31 March 2005 did not have a material effect on the price of FMG's shares. However, he noted that the damage that would have been caused by the release of this information had already been done by way of the disclosures made in the AFR article. Although Sisson was not asked to consider the effect that the disclosure made in the AFR Article on 24 March 2005 had on FMG's share price, he Sisson agreed with Houston that the share price movements on 24 March and 29-30 March 2005 were significant. He also agreed that there were several items of news released in the AFR article and that there is no determinative method for separating the effect of each item of news that would be capable of supporting a statistically robust conclusion as to the materiality of any particular one. However, in contrast to Houston, Sisson considered that it is possible to make qualitative judgments on these matters. I accept ASIC's submission that the share market events of March 2005 have limited relevance to the s 674 contraventions alleged by it. The question is whether they illustrate the way in which FMG share prices could be expected to have reacted, if at some stage after 23 August 2004 or after 8 November 2004 FMG had issued announcements retracting and correcting the false statements that ASIC says were issued by FMG on 23 August 2004 and then on 5 and 8 November 2004. Any use of the March events in that way would need to take account of two main factual differences. First, both market circumstances and FMG's circumstances in August and November 2004 were different from those of March 2005. Second, the actual terms and effect of the framework agreements were revealed over a period of days and those disclosures were triggered by the AFR Article which contained other negative information, with the result that it is not possible to attribute quantitatively what impact was the result of which piece of information. I accept the evidence of Houston, Sisson and Watson that the share price movements on 24 March and 29-30 March 2005 were significant. However the content of the AFR Article and its consequences were, in the end, too far removed from the market circumstances which prevailed in both August and November 2004. I was not assisted by this evidence on the question of materiality. 8.5: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AS TO MATERIALITY Ex ante evidence: hypothetical disclosure to the market of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information instead of the actual announcements The notification of CREC Information in August 2004 and the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information in November 2004 would not likely have influenced common investors in FMG's shares in deciding to acquire these. I therefore find that the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information was not information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price or value of FMG's securities. Ex ante evidence: the announcements actually made (a) The August notification would not likely have influenced common investors in deciding to acquire FMG's shares. (b) The November notifications would or would likely have influenced common investors in deciding to acquire FMG's shares. Ex ante evidence: the hypothetical disclosure of the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Information at some time after the announcements actually made (a) The CREC Information: (i) if released after the actual notification to the ASX on 23 August and prior to the November notifications would not, or would not have been likely to have influenced, persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. Accordingly, the CREC Information was not during that period information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's securities for the purposes of s 674(2). (ii) if released after the actual notifications to the ASX in November would have, or would have been likely to have influenced, persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. Accordingly, the CREC Information was during that period information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's securities for the purposes of s 674(2). (b) The CHEC and CMCC Information, if released some time after the actual notifications were made in November, was information which would have, or would have been likely to have influenced, persons who commonly invest in securities in deciding whether to acquire or dispose of FMG's securities. Accordingly, the CHEC and CMCC Information was during that period information that a reasonable person would expect, if it were generally available, to have had a material effect on the price of FMG's securities for the purposes of s 674(2). ex post statistical evidence: effect of the actual announcements in August and November (Question 7) (a) The notification made on 23 August 2004 did not have any statistically significant effect on the FMG share price. (b) The notifications made in the period 5-9 November did have a statistically significant effect on the FMG share price. The statements in the AFR Article The share price movements on 24 March and 29-30 March were significant. However given the extent of confounding news contained in the AFR Article, and FMG's subsequent disclosure on 29 March 2005, there is no systematic or rigorous method for separating the effect of each item of news that would be capable of supporting a statistically robust conclusion as to the materiality of any one of them. PART 9: ASIC'S SECTION 1041H CASE ASIC alleges that between 23 August 2004 and 24 March 2005, on sixteen separate occasions, FMG and Forrest on FMG's behalf made many false and misleading statements about the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. The FMG notification documents and statements made between August 2004 and March 2005 are as follows. I will refer to these collectively whether in whole or in part as \"disclosures\". Notification documents the 23 August Letter: a letter from FMG to ASX entitled \"China Signs to Build Railway\" dated 23 August 2004; ASC [24]-[27] the 23 August Media Release: a media release entitled \"China Signs to Build Fortescue Metals' Multi-User Iron Ore Railway in the Pilbara\"; ASC [29]-[33] the 5 November Letter: a letter from FMG to ASX entitled \"Design, Construct and Finance Agreements for Port, Rail and Processing Plant\" dated 5 November 2004; ASC [75]-[79] the 5 November Media Release: a media release entitled \"China to Fund New $A1.85 Billion Australian Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project\" dated 5 November 2004; ASC [80]-[85] the 8 November Letter: letter from FMG to ASX entitled \"Additional Information on China Harbour and China Rail Agreements\" dated 8 November 2004; ASC [86]-[90] Statements Press Conference --- 23 August 2004: a telephone press conference conducted by Forrest with media representatives; ASC [35]-[39] FMG's 2004 Annual Financial Report which FMG sent to ASX on 27 August 2004; ASC [41]-[45] A televised interview with Forrest on the Business Sunday program on or about 17 October 2004; ASC [46]-[48] FMG's 2004 Annual Report which FMG sent to the ASX on 25 October 2004 ; ASC [49]-[53] FMG's September 2004 Quarterly Report which FMG sent to the ASX on 29 October 2004; ASC [54]-[58] the November Presentation: a copy of PowerPoint slides used in a presentation to potential investors which FMG sent to the ASX on 24 November 2004; ASC [92]-[95] FMG's December 2004 Quarterly Report which FMG sent to the ASX on 31 January 2005; ASC [103]-[106] the February Presentation: a copy of PowerPoint slides used in a presentation to potential investors which FMG sent to the ASX on 10 February 2005; ASC [109]-[112] the RIU Presentation: a presentation made by Forrest on FMG's behalf on 22 February 2005 to attendees at the RIU Explorer's Conference; ASC [113]-[115] the Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation (first disclosure): a presentation of PowerPoint slides by Forrest on FMG's behalf on 28 February 2005 to attendees at the AJM Iron Ore & Steel Forecast Conference ; ASC [116]-[118] the Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation (second disclosure): a copy of the PowerPoint slides presented by Forrest in the first disclosure of the Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation which FMG sent to the ASX on 28 February 2005; ASC [119]-[122] Misleading and deceptive conduct under the Act These disclosures are said to have conveyed representations or created impressions which were false and thereby misleading and deceptive. These, says ASIC, reveal a relentless pursuit for a positive FMG story by FMG and Forrest and a persistent disregard for truth or accuracy, and, in particular a relentless pursuit of a deceitful campaign to distort and exaggerate the content and significance of the agreements that were made between FMG on the one hand and CREC, CHEC and CMCC on the other hand. ASIC's primary case is that both FMG and Forrest knew full well that the framework agreements could not be characterised or described as binding BT contracts of a kind common in the international engineering and construction industry under which the Chinese contractors had undertaken legally binding obligations to build, construct, finance and transfer the relevant infrastructure and did not oblige the Chinese Contractors to build, finance and transfer the Project infrastructure. ASIC alleges that FMG made, and Forrest made or was involved in these false unqualified and emphatic disclosures against a backdrop of FMG's knowledge and appreciation of the unresolved status of their dealings with the Chinese about equity and NDRC approval. It pleads, at ASC [71], that by at least 17 August 2004, alternatively by 5 November 2004, FMG knew or ought to reasonably have known that: (a) CREC, CHEC and CMCC would not, or probably would not, carry out the works necessary for the Project without the approval of the NDRC; (b) the NDRC would, or probably would, withhold its approval for CREC, CHEC or CMCC to enter contracts binding them to build, finance and transfer the infrastructure necessary for the Project unless a Chinese entity obtained an equity interest in the Project; This pleading seems ambiguous. The allegation at ASC [71(a)] does not refer to approval for the Chinese Contractors to \"enter\" contracts, as ASC [71(b)] does, but rather seems to assume that contracts had already been entered into but that NDRC approval was required in relation to performance of these contracts. Further ASIC alleges that in making the false, misleading and deceptive disclosures, FMG represented to or created the impression for various audiences that it had a genuine and reasonable basis for making those statements when it and Forrest knew there to be no such basis: ASC: 27(b), 32(f), 38(b), 44(b), 47(b), 52(b), 57(b), 78(g), 84(f), 89(e), 94(e), 105(e), 111(e), 114(e), 117(e) and 121(e). FMG denies these allegations. The proscription on misleading and deceptive conduct was included in the Corporations Law in 1991 to protect investors from misleading conduct by those dealing in securities and thereby, preserve the integrity of the market. Section 995 of the Corporations Law was the antecedent of s 1041H. The provision is important in maintaining integrity in the securities market. The Explanatory Memorandum to the Corporations Bill 1988 considered the introduction of s 995. It states that the section was drafted along the lines of s 52 of the TPA . Further : While supporting deregulatory moves in general, the Government is concerned that investors be protected from unscrupulous activity in the securities market. This clause emphasises that persons, in their dealings in the securities industry, should not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct... A guide to what type of conduct is misleading or deceptive can be gained from the many cases decided under TPA s 52...In order to stress the undesirability of the conduct in question it was considered important to include a similar provision to s 52 in the Bill. Following the referral by all Australian states of their constitutional powers in respect of corporations to the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth enacted the Act and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 , with both statutes commencing on 15 July 2001. Section 995 of the Corporations Bill 2001 was in substantially the same terms as s 995 of the Law. Amendments made by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth), commencing on 11 March 2002, replaced s 995 with s 1041H. According to clause 15.8 of the Revised Explanatory Memorandum for the Financial Services Reform Bill 2001, \"A general prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct will be introduced (proposed section 1041H) to replace section 995 of the proposed Corporations Act . \" The effect of the amendments was to expand the scope of s 1041H beyond dealing in securities to any misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to a financial product or financial services. The Full Federal Court has recognised that the scope of the operation of s 1041H is very wide: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Narain [2008] FCAFC 120 ; (2008) 169 FCR 211. Special leave to appeal to the High Court was refused: Narain v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2008] HCATrans 408 per Crennan and Kiefel JJ. Section 1041H: general principles Although ASIC pleads a case in the alternative under s 52 TPA it made no separate written closing submissions on this case. This is because, I think, it adds nothing to its case under s 1041H. I will deal then only with that case. It is accordingly unnecessary for me to deal with FMG's submission that ASIC cannot assert that FMG contravened s 52 of the TPA without a delegation of such function and power from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission which it says has not been given. Section 1041H(1) of the Act prescribes a norm of corporate conduct. Its reach is narrower than that of s 52 of the TPA. It provides that a person must not: (a) in this jurisdiction; (b) engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive; (c) in relation to a financial product or a financial service. Section 1041H(2) provides, relevantly: The reference in subsection (1) to engaging in conduct in relation to a financial product includes (but is not limited to) any of the following: (a) dealing in a financial product; (b) without limiting paragraph (a): (i) issuing a financial product; (ii) publishing a notice in relation to a financial product; . . . (x) carrying on negotiations, or making arrangements, or doing any other act, preparatory to, or in any way related to, an activity covered by any of subparagraphs (i) to (ix). A financial product includes shares traded on the ASX: ss 764A and 761A of the Act. There is no issue as between ASIC and FMG that the impugned conduct occurred in Australia and related to a financial product, namely FMG securities. Forrest however contends that certain of the impugned conduct is not \"in relation to a financial product or a financial service\": s 1041H(1)(c) Was certain conduct in relation to a financial product or a financial service? He submits that the words \"in relation to\" signify the need for there to be some relationship or correlation between FMG's conduct and its shares: ASIC v Narain [2008] FCAFC 120 ; 169 FCR 211 per Jacobson and Gordon JJ at [69] and [74]. There the respondent was the managing director of Citrofresh International Ltd (CTF). The respondent was involved in the writing of an \"ASX Release\" which claimed that CTF's products could reduce the spread of four major viruses including HIV/AIDS. The respondent instructed CTF's secretary to send the statement to the Australian Stock Exchange who published it. The statement affected the price of CTF shares. It was held at first instance that the ASX Release did not contain representations \"in relation to\" CTF's shares pursuant to s 1041H of the Act because the statement did not refer to shares on the face of it, or deal with the shares directly. This construction was rejected by the Full Court which held that the phase \"in relation to\" in s 1041H of the Act only requires an indirect or less than substantial connection between the misleading conduct or statement and the financial product and that it is not necessary for a statement to expressly refer to the shares or to deal with the shares on its face. In deciding that the respondent engaged in conduct in relation to a financial product, CTF's shares, by publishing the statement on the ASX, Finkelstein J held that there was a sufficient connection between the statement and CTF's shares by reason of (1) the content of the statements, which concerned the business of CTF; and (2) the place of their publication, namely on the the exchange where the shares were traded. Jacobson and Gordon JJ said the concept of misleading and deceptive conduct is one which embraces all of the circumstances in which the conduct takes place, and that the relevant conduct was not merely the text of the announcement. Their Honours said the statement was an announcement made to the ASX about a \"landmark\" test result for the company's products and was disclosure to the market. Forrest submits that the Court's ratio in Narain was that CTF's representations contained in announcements made to the ASX were \"in relation to a financial product\" because the representations were published where shares were traded. I do not think this was what their Honour's intended although the announcement in that case was made to the ASX. For Finkelstein J, the publication on the ASX was just one of two factors giving rise to the connection between the statement and the relevant financial product. In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Cycclone Magnetic Engines Inc [2009] QSC 58 , Martin J was asked to consider whether publications including television news film made on Cycclone's website was in relation to a financial product (at [124]). Evidence was adduced that the defendant had referred prospective shareholders to its website (at [125]). Martin J stated at [146] and [147]: [146] The web site was, no doubt, intended to fulfil a number of functions. One would have been to publicise CME in a general way. Another was to allow interested persons to contact CME - the web site contained a feedback page. Another was, as the home page made clear, \"to obtain... direct investment and to complete the development program\". [147] The conduct of CME in placing the film on the web site and then describing it as showing the engine working is relevantly indistinguishable from writing an ASX release to the same effect, especially in the context of the introductory words on the home page about \"obtaining direct investment\", that is, shares in CME. That conduct, therefore, comes within s 1041H. Forrest submits that these observations suggest that publicising FMG in a general way is not conduct in relation to a financial product. I do not agree. Martin J's comments at [147] demonstrate that he viewed the conduct in placing the film on the web site and then describing it as showing the engine working is relevantly indistinguishable from writing an ASX release to the same effect. His Honour's use of the word 'especially' in that paragraph indicates that that conclusion was reinforced by, and not dependent upon, the introductory words on the home page about obtaining direct investment. FMG sent the 23 August Letter, 2004 Annual Financial Report, 2004 Annual Report, September Quarterly Report, 5 November Letter, 8 November Letter, November Presentation, December Quarterly Report, February Presentation and Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation to the ASX. The letters were re-published to the market in the ordinary course by the ASX. It does not dispute that those publications were in relation to a financial product. Further FMG published the 23 August Media Release, 5 November Media Release and February Presentation on its website. The 23 August Letter and the 5 November Letter referred readers to FMGs website. It does not dispute that those publications were in relation to a financial product. However Forrest submits that \"giving\" the 23 August Press Conference, Business Sunday Interview, RIU Presentation and Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation did not amount to conduct in relation to a financial product because: (a) the Press Conference was held between FMG and media representatives and FMG did not directly converse with potential investors or the ASX market during the conference; (b) the Business Sunday Interview was not published on the ASX (where shares were traded) or on FMG's website and FMG did not make any representations in the interview regarding its shares; (c) although FMG and Forrest admit that the RIU and Bag of Rusty Nails Presentations were given ASIC has not adduced evidence that the Presentations' audience were potential investors. No evidence has been adduced regarding the relevant attendees (if any) at those conferences or that representations were made, during the Presentations regarding the purchase of FMG's shares. I conclude that the making of statements by Forrest on behalf of FMG at each of the 23 August Press Conference and the Business Sunday Interview was conduct in relation to a financial product. It is to be expected that the seven media representatives present at the Press Conference would republish those statements in some form in the broad financial press and thereby report on the statements made to the market which would include actual or potential investors in FMG securities. The Business Sunday Interview is a televised business program which is watched, I infer, by at least potential investors in FMG securities. The RIU Explorers Conference brochure discloses that it was attended by representatives of a considerable number of mining companies. It appears to have been a professional conference. The RIU Presentation was not sent to the ASX. I am however not persuaded, for lack of evidence as to the attendees, that the RIU Presentation at the RIU Explorers Conference meets the statutory description as construed in ASIC v Narain [2008] FCAFC 120 ; 169 FCR 211 . There is no precise evidence as to who attended the AJM Iron Ore and Steel Forecast where the Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation was given. I have described this as the \"first disclosure\". However, Kirchlechner had attended this conference for a number of years and he said that typically, amongst others, there were brokers who attended. I take him to be referring to stock brokers. A copy of the PowerPoint slides used in the presentation was sent to the ASX. I have described this as the \"second disclosure\". These contain information amongst other things as to the source of FMG's funding for the Project including $630m from \"China Rail\"; $571m from \"China Harbour\"and $306m from \"China Metallurgical\". These are references to CREC, CHEC and CMCC. The amounts are said to be \"under agreement\". I accept that this conveys the impression of binding agreements between FMG and each of those companies. This information lies in the context of public knowledge of the fact of the execution of these three agreements as binding agreements. They therefore constitute, in effect, a re-publication of that information to the market and therefore is conduct in relation to a financial product. I am satisfied that the first and second disclosures constituted conduct by FMG in relation to a financial product. General principles in relation to s 52 are applicable The authorities dealing with misleading and deceptive conduct under s 52 of the TPA are useful when characterising conduct for the purposes of s 1041H. As Rolfe J observed in Wilkinson v Feldworth Financial Services Pty Ltd (1999) 17 ACLC 220 at 228 in relation to s 995 of the Corporations Law: ... the engaging in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive has the same meaning as, and should be treated in the same way as, those words in s 52 of the Trade Practices Act from which they have obviously been taken. In Fame Decorator Agencies Pty Limited v Jeffries Industries Ltd [1998] HCA 30 ; (1998) 16 ACLC 1 ,235 at 1,240-1,241, a case also dealing with s 995, Gleeson CJ with whom Powell JA agreed stated that the parliament regarded is as desirable that, although s 52 of the TPA may have applied to some cases of dealing in securities, there should be a similar provision having as its focus conduct in relation to securities. His Honour added that much of the case law which has developed around s 52 will apply also to s 995. In Campomar Sociedad, Limitada v Nike International Ltd [2000] HCA 12 ; (2000) 202 CLR 45 , the High Court set out a number of principles in relation to s 52 of the TPA. In National Exchange v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2004] FCAFC 90 ; (2004) 22 ACLC 609 , Dowsett J, with whom Jacobson and Bennett JJ agreed with generally, compiled at [18] a helpful summary of the propositions relevant to the application of s 52 emerging from the High Court's judgment in Campomar Sociedad. Dowsett J's summary, to which I have added references to the paragraphs of the High Court's judgment applicable to each proposition, is as follows. His Honour accepted that these observations are of general application in proceedings alleging contravention of s 1041H(1) of the Act, [19]. Conduct will only be misleading or deceptive, or likely to mislead or deceive if there is a nexus between such conduct and any actual or anticipated misconception or deception. [98] In identifying such nexus regard must be had to the circumstances of the particular case, including the remedies sought. Section 52 of the TP Act does not confer any entitlement to a remedy for breach or anticipated breach. One must look elsewhere in the TP Act for such entitlement and construe the act as a whole. [99] In some cases, a representation may be made to identified individuals; in other cases the representation may be to the public at large or to a section thereof. In the former case the process of deciding whether or not the representation is misleading or deceptive or likely to be so may be 'direct and uncomplicated'. In the latter case 'the issue with respect to the sufficiency of the nexus between the conduct or the apprehended conduct and the misleading or deception or likely misleading or deception of prospective purchasers is to be approached at a level of abstraction not present where the case is one involving an express untrue representation allegedly made only to identified individuals'. (I infer that the word \"representation\" in [100] of Nike should be \"misrepresentation\", relying upon the relevant passage in Taco Bell to which the High Court was referring. ) [100] When the representation is made to the public or to a section thereof, one must consider its effect upon an ordinary or reasonable member of the class in question. Although such class may include a wide range of persons, the ordinary or reasonable member will objectively be identified as having certain characteristics. In particular he or she can be expected to take reasonable care for his or her own interests and otherwise to behave reasonably. [101]-[102] It is necessary to inquire as to how a particular or anticipated misconception has arisen or may arise. In so doing, the Court will consider 'the effect of the relevant conduct on reasonable members of the class'. [103] Conduct will only be misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive if the representee 'labours under some erroneous assumption' or may be expected so to labour. Such an assumption or anticipated assumption may be obvious, predictable or fanciful. [104] In assessing the reactions or likely reactions of the ordinary or reasonable member of the class, the Court may decline to treat as reasonable, assumptions which are extreme or fanciful. The initial question which must be determined is whether the misconception or deception, alleged or anticipated, is properly attributable to an ordinary or reasonable member of the class. [105] The 'question whether particular conduct causes confusion or wonderment cannot be substituted for the question whether the conduct answers the statutory description contained in s 52. ' [106] A further relevant principle concerns the intention of the representor. Intention is not a necessary element of the contravention of s 52. The section involves no questions of intent upon the part of the corporation whose conduct is in question: Hornsby Building Information Centre Pty Ltd v Sydney Building Information Centre Ltd [1978] HCA 11 ; (1978) 140 CLR 216 at 228 per Stephen J; Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Proprietary Limited v Puxu Proprietary Limited [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 216 per Brennan J. However, where there is a finding of intention to deceive, the court may more readily infer that the intention has been or in all probability will be effective: Cadbury-Schweppes Pty Ltd v Pub Squash Co Pty Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 851 at 861; S & I Publishing Pty Ltd v Australian Surf Life Saver Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 316 ; (1998) 88 FCR 354 at 362; Campomar Sociedad [2000] HCA 12 ; 202 CLR 45 at [33] and National Exchange [2004] FCAFC 90 ; 22 ACLC 609 at [63] per Jacobson and Bennett JJ. ASIC refers to the recent decision of Gzell J in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199 where Mr Macdonald, the chief executive officer and a director of James Hardie Industries Limited was held to have contravened s 180(1) by: making false or misleading statements at a press conference; and approving, or failing to advise not to release, or failing to remove matters that were false or misleading from, an ASX announcement which contained over-emphatic statements and which were false or misleading. Mr Macdonald and number of other directors were also held to have contravened s 180(1) by approving a draft ASX announcement which contained false or misleading or deceptive statements about the funding of a medical research and compensation fund that the company was establishing. His Honour stated that the directors ought to have been and they should have realised that they were prevented from approving the unequivocal and unqualified statements as to certainty of sufficient funding in the draft announcement. In the present case, ASIC pleads (ASC [166(b)(1)]) that the information in each of FMG's disclosures was published to \"persons who commonly invest in securities in the ASX's financial market\". Further, ASIC pleads that FMG's conduct in publishing the information, making the statements and representations, or creating the impressions associated with the disclosures was conduct \"designed to encourage reasonable investors in the ASX's financial market to invest, or to continue investments, in the First Defendant\". This formulation I regard as no different, in substance, to the language of s 677 of the Act, namely the question of the influence or likely influence of information upon common investors. I do not think it is intended by ASIC to describe an actual causal consequence but merely an encouraging or influencing factor. ASIC, borrowing from the language of Gzell J, submits that FMG's and Forrest's disclosures to the market between 23 August 2004 and 24 March 2005 were likewise emphatic, unequivocal and unqualified. Thus while ASIC is not required to prove that FMG intended to engage in misleading or deceptive conduct to establish contraventions of s 1041H, evidence of intent will allow the Court to readily infer that the intention has been effective. ASIC submits that the evidence supports a finding that FMG and Forrest in particular intended to mislead and deceive investors and potential investors in FMG shares. The Representees The various persons to whom ASIC claims FMG made the disclosures were: reasonable investors in the ASX's financial market; media publishers; the audience of the media publishers; persons obtaining access to media releases, FMG's letters to the ASX and other company reports on FMG's website; media representatives who attended a telephone press conference conducted by Mr Forrest on 23 August 2004; the audience of the Business Sunday television program broadcast on or about 17 October 2004; and attendees at conferences between August 2004 and March 2005 where Forrest gave presentations on behalf of FMG. Relevance of media commentary ASIC's claim that the disclosures were false and misleading is pleaded against a factual background summarised by ASIC at ASC [18], subparas (a) to (v). That background is derived from 265 documents listed in Schedule 10 to the ASC. The documents included in the Schedule are from the following sources: Letters, media releases, conference and meeting presentations, progress reports and statutory reports provided to the ASX by FMG; and Media reports published by newswire services such as Australian Associated Press Financial News Wire; and by national and capital city newspapers including the Australian Financial Review, The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, and The West Australian. The background as set out at ASC [18] is as follows. Between 21 July 2003 and 28 February 2005, FMG in effect informed the ASX, which published and made public announcements, and the media published reports containing information to the effect, that: (a) FMG aimed to become a \"new force\" in the iron ore industry as rapidly as possible, by mining and exporting iron ore resources from the Pilbara region of Western Australia; (b) FMG aimed to rival two other international iron ore producers (the BHP Billiton Group and the Rio Tinto Group), by building a common user or open access port and rail system; (c) FMG owned substantial mining tenements in the Pilbara Region, which contained large amounts of iron ore; (d) FMG intended to take advantage of an existing opportunity to supply iron ore to international markets where international demand far exceeded international supply; (e) FMG intended to develop the Project which involved the design, finance and construction of an iron ore mine and processing plant, a new railway line and a port facility to transport iron ore from the Pilbara to international purchasers; (f) FMG had entered and proposed to enter Memoranda of Intent or Memoranda of Understanding or sales contracts with major Chinese steel mills to supply iron ore to these mills pursuant to which some mills would provide finance to FMG; (g) FMG intended to have arranged all necessary approvals and all necessary finance in order to commence construction of the mine, railway and port facilities by early 2005; (h) detailed Prefeasibility Studies for the Project had been completed, and Worley Group Limited (\"Worley\") had been appointed as manager to undertake a Definitive Feasibility Study for the Project which was to be completed by February 2005; (i) FMG proposed to work with an investment house to fully capitalise the Fortescue Metals Group of companies through to financial drawdown, which was expected to be achieved soon after the completion of the Definitive Feasibility Study; (j) discussions had been commenced with the China Railway and Engineering Corporation (\"CREC\") which centred on a potential build and transfer contract for rail infrastructure in conjunction with major Australian contractors, and that site visits by CREC were planned in the near future; (k) FMG proposed to commence delivery of iron ore to international customers in 2006/2007; (l) FMG had applied for access to the Mount Newman rail line operated by the BHP Billiton Group; (m) FMG had moved its drilling program to Christmas Creek where it had found significant amounts of Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee (\"JORC\") classified resource; (n) FMG had entered into a binding contract with CREC to design, build, finance and transfer the railway component of the Project; (o) FMG's drilling results for the Chichester Ranges indicated significant amounts of JORC classified resource; (p) FMG had entered into a binding contract with China Harbour Engineering Company (Group) (\"CHEC\") to design, build, finance and transfer the ship loading and stockyard facility of the Project; (q) FMG had entered into a binding contract with China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (\"CMCC\") to design, build, finance and transfer the mine component of the Project; (r) CHEC and CMCC had signed Memoranda of Understanding with large contracting firms for the construction of the ship loading and stockyard facility and the mine component of the Project; (s) FMG had entered a State Agreement to facilitate the construction of its planned railway; (t) the Federal Government of Australia had granted the Project \"Major Project Facilitation Status\"; (u) FMG had raised a significant amount of additional capital; (v) FMG had decided to target its tenements in a new project area near Christmas Creek called \"Cloud Break\" which had large amounts of iron ore. The media reports listed in Schedule 10 were published over the period from February 2004 to February 2005. ASIC submits that whether FMG's disclosures were misleading or deceptive is to be judged in the context of information generally available at the material times by a reasonable member of the relevant class, namely, common investors. From those media reports, and from some further reports which it tendered, FMG points to those aspects of the considerable financial media commentary immediately following the disclosures of 23 August 2004 concerning the CREC Framework Agreement which reflected the highly contingent context in which they sat, as follows: the railway depended on a bankable DFS for which FMG still needed to raise $15 million to complete; the Project was still conceptual; the agreement did not mean the Project would go ahead; while the Western Australian state development minister Clive Brown had received cabinet approval to negotiate two state agreements with FMG, the Project remained contingent on environmental approval which was not expected until the first half of 2005; FMG had not reached the stage of defining a resource at its iron ore prospects; Some sections of the industry doubted if Forrest could pull it off. ASIC, on the other hand, submits that the media reports on 23 and 24 August 2004, which immediately followed the disclosures of 23 August 2004, generally emphasised one or more of the following matters. the agreement was one to build and finance a railway line; CREC would bear full risk under the agreement; the agreement was worth between A$600-800 million; the effect of the agreement was to secure finance for a large part of the infrastructure costs for the Project, making it much easier for FMG to obtain finance for the rest of the capital costs of the Project. FMG does not dispute ASIC's contention that the FMG's disclosures conveyed to the market news of a binding agreement for the construction of the railway, but it says the common investor would have understood the reference to a binding agreement as the entry by the parties into a binding first agreement with respect to the building and financing of the railway, to be followed by further, more detailed agreement or agreements, as the contingencies for the construction of the Project were fulfilled, and that the first agreement would not go ahead unless those contingencies were fulfilled. FMG submits that the disclosures of 5 and 9 November would have been read together by the market in the context of the next trading decision of investors as there was no trading in FMG shares between the releases of the two letters. This was accepted by Sisson, one of the experts called by ASIC. FMG submits that the media commentary highlighted the following: a formal go-ahead for the Project still hinged on a bankable DFS, due for completion in the first half of next year; FMG still had relatively low grade iron ore deposits; there was no start-up date specified for any of the mine or infrastructure construction, and drilling in the Pilbara was a long way from being completed; Australian institutions remained wary of embracing Mr Forrest; the vast majority of funds ploughed into FMG had come from overseas; until work actually started on the Project and conditional agreements came into effect, uncertainty would remain; The missing element in FMG's plans was long-term supply contracts covering the planned 45 million tonnes a year production rate; FMG had so far secured long-term binding sales contracts covering the delivery of only 8 million tonnes of iron ore a year. ASIC again emphasised similar aspects as before from the media commentary relating to the November announcements as follows: the agreements were described as contracts to \"build and finance\" the infrastructure necessary for the Project; the agreements transferred all or most of the risk for the Project to the parties; the financing aspect of the Project was substantially resolved by the Chinese agreements; FMG's share price had escalated significantly after the trading halt was lifted on 9 November 2004; that the Chinese government had \"put up 90 per cent of the $1.85 billion cost of developing a new iron ore mine in the Pilbara, building a 400 km rail line and a port\"; and that the agreement with CMCC, following a similar agreement with CREC, \"effectively guaranteed the project will proceed\". The media articles provide some objective evidence, perhaps, as to what the market understood concerning the disclosures. I say 'perhaps', because media reports do not always reflect general market sentiment. Understandably, each of ASIC and FMG have focused on aspects of the media commentary which most assisted their respective cases. Taken as a whole, I conclude that the market would have understood from the media commentary that binding agreements to build and transfer the Project infrastructure had been made but that, importantly, the market was under no misapprehension that such construction was going to occur immediately and indeed that it would not occur at all unless and until a bankable DFS had been completed. That such would happen was, when the disclosures were made, by no means certain and was subject to very significant contingencies some of which the media commentary highlighted. That they conveyed the fact of binding agreements to the market was the republication, in effect, of FMG's opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. Reasoning ASIC's primary case, under s 1041H, that the disclosures to the effect that the framework agreements were binding build and transfer agreements were misleading and deceptive because they actually did not oblige the Chinese Contractors, amongst other things, to construct or finance, or transfer the infrastructure, depends, as I have found, upon the formulation of an opinion to that effect as to the meaning and legal effect of each of the three framework agreements. In Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Pty Ltd [1984] FCA 180 ; (1984) 2 FCR 82 , the Court (Bowen CJ, Lockhart and Fitzgerald JJ) stated at 88: An expression of opinion which is identifiable as such conveys no more than that the opinion expressed is held and perhaps that there is a basis for the opinion. At least if those conditions are met, an expression of opinion, however erroneous, misrepresents nothing. In Glorie v WA Chip and Pulp Co Pty Ltd [1981] FCA 224 ; (1981) 55 FLR 310 at 328, Morling J stated: I do not think that a statement is necessarily misleading or deceptive if it cannot be demonstrated to be correct beyond any doubt. Nor is it necessarily misleading or deceptive merely if it is not accompanied by words indicating that a contrary view is held by others. If it were otherwise, public discussion and the free expression of opinions would be greatly inhibited. This would especially be the case where the statement is one of opinion or of mixed fact and opinion. When such a statement is made, the person to whom it is addressed will, in most cases, understand that there may be room for another opinion on the same matter. Where that is the case, I find it difficult to characterize the statement as being misleading or deceptive. The position would be different, of course, when a statement of opinion is made by a person who does not, in fact, hold that opinion. It might be thought that the disclosures, to the effect that FMG had executed binding build and transfer agreements with each of the Chinese Contractors, ought be characterised as statements of fact rather than opinion. Certainly, they were assertive in nature and were not expressly said to be expressions of opinion. However, I consider that they constitute mixed fact and law. As an objective matter, an assertion as to the meaning and legal effect of an agreement is necessarily the product of an opinion formulated to that effect. However the disclosures are characterised, a question as to the reasonableness of the underlying opinion and, in this case, whether or not it was honestly held, arises. A reasonable reader of the disclosures made by FMG and Forrest on FMG's behalf would have expected FMG to have a genuine and reasonable basis for making those statements: Global Sportsman v Mirror Newspapers [1984] FCA 180 ; 2 FCR 82 at 88; James v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (1986) 64 ALR 347 at 372 per Toohey J; Wright v Wheeler Grace & Pierucci Pty Ltd (1988) ATPR 40-865 at 49,375-49,376 per French J (affirmed in Wheeler Grace & Pierucci Pty Ltd v Wright (1989) 16 IPR 189) ; Bateman v Slayter (1987) 71 ALR 553 at 559 per Burchett J. I have already concluded that it was reasonable, objectively, for FMG by Forrest and other members of FMG's Board to hold the opinion, which it and they honestly held, that the framework agreements were binding upon each of the Chinese Contractors to build, finance and transfer the Project infrastructure. I found that ASIC has not established, for the purposes of its s 674 case, that FMG, by Forrest and other board members, ought reasonably to have held a different opinion, namely, the one contended by ASIC, in effect, to be the only reasonable opinion as to the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements. FMG's disclosures concerning the binding nature of the framework agreements reflect the underlying opinion that the agreements were such. It finds arguable support in the authorities which I have considered at length in Part 8.2. The expression of that opinion, by an assertion that the agreements were binding, misrepresented nothing. That there was scope for alternative opinions to be held as to the legal effect of the framework agreements does not mean that FMG engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by asserting what it did based on its different opinion. I find that the disclosures complained of do not constitute misleading or deceptive conduct for the purposes of s 1041H. Approvals and Chinese requests for equity ASIC pleads at ASC [71] as an additional or alternative case to its primary case, based in the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements, that at the latest, by 17 August 2004, alternatively by 5 November 2004, FMG and Forrest knew or ought reasonably to have known of the need for NDRC approval and the related requirement for an equity interest to be provided by FMG to a Chinese entity. I have already adverted to what I regard as the ambiguous nature of this pleading. It is only the issue of approval by NDRC which is pleaded. However, the documents tendered refer to additional Chinese Government authorities involved in matters of approval and I propose to refer to these even if only to provide an accurate context. It is not an easy task to distill ASIC's case as to the alleged misleading and deceptive conduct as it bears on the matter of the NDRC approval. The relevant paragraphs of the pleading are lengthy and include cross-references to other paragraphs which themselves contain additional cross-referencing. Paragraph 85(e) of the statement of claim is an illustration of this. It refers back to paras 67-73 and 84(f). Paragraph 70 refers back to paras 19, 21, 22 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68 and 69. Paragraph 71 refers back to paras 20, 61, 65 and 67-70. Paragraph 65 refers back to para 63. Many of the paragraphs contain very lengthy particulars. As FMG points out the only pleaded reliance by ASIC on the issues of approvals and equity in connection with its continuous disclosure case is as a particular of its alternative claims that s 674 requires that information notified to the ASX not be misleading or deceptive (ASC [141]-[145]), and further that there was a failure by FMG to correct false information (ASC [146]-[153]). The statement of claim does not actually allege that there was an obligation on the part of FMG to disclose the information concerning approvals and equity. Senior counsel for ASIC in oral closing submissions clarified the position. He said: It's not our case that the state of equity negotiations had to be disclosed pursuant to section 674. It's not our case that they needed to say anything about equity. Our case is that they could not make the unqualified and emphatic claims that they had binding build and transfer contracts knowing that such agreements as they had were subject to a requirement or demand from the Chinese authorities that they had to be approved and a condition of approval was equity. This explanation clarifies that these matters are pleaded as circumstances informing FMG's knowledge, actual or constructive, as to why the disclosures it made as to the legal effect of the framework agreements were misleading or deceptive or likely to be so for the purposes of s 1041H. FMG also submits that the evidence demonstrates that prior to the ceremonies for the signing by the parties of the Joint Statements rendering the framework agreements binding, all communications between FMG and the Chinese governmental authorities were positive and that FMG legitimately proceeded on the basis that the necessary approvals had been granted for the execution, and had been or would be granted for the implementation, of the framework agreements. FMG submits that ASIC seeks to commingle the issues of the Chinese seeking equity in FMG and Chinese government approval of the Chinese Contractors for FMG's Project when it is important that these two issues be considered separately because the evidence demonstrates that the genesis and development of the two issues is quite discrete. FMG also submits that the extent of the connection between the two issues is unclear both as to the representations made by the Chinese and FMG's understanding of the situation. From as early as November 2003, FMG was encouraging Chinese investment in the company, or related companies. It entered into two Memoranda of Intent in November 2003 with two Chinese steel mills, China Shougang International Trade & Engineering Corporation and Chiao United (Fuzhou) Steel Co Ltd which relevantly provided for the negotiation in good faith of long term agreements which would include direct equity participation in either infrastructure or mining operations. FMG publicly stated in November 2003 that it wished to split the Project by vesting the port and rail into an entity known as the Pilbara Infrastructure Fund (PIF). FMG also made clear in its promotion of the Project, that it proposed to retain only 40% equity in PIF, whilst retaining all equity in the mining operations, and that it envisaged that 60% equity in FMG and PIF would be offered to infrastructure investors, iron ore customers and suppliers/construction groups. By July 2004, FMG had developed a detailed \"Project Brief\" document for use in promoting investments into FMG, which proposed Project funding on the basis of 30% equity and 70% debt funding, whilst maintaining the position that PIF would be 40% owned by FMG and 60% owned by external investors. I am persuaded by FMG's submissions that from an early stage of the Project FMG encouraged Chinese entities to invest in FMG or its related companies. In January 2004, FMG met with several potential Chinese investors, including CITIC Australia Commodity Trading Pty Ltd. This company apparently is part of the Chinese conglomerate \"China International Trust and Investment Corporation\" (CITIC). On 23 August 2004 Forrest, Kirchlechner and David Liu attended a meeting with CITIC in China. In the report of that meeting it was mentioned that CITIC was run like a special entity under the State Council specialising in banking, manufacturing and service industries, and that it had total assets of USD72.3 billion and profit the previous year of USD200 million. The Chairman of CITIC, Mr Wang Jun, expressed an interest on behalf of CITIC in a 20% equity in FMG. By September 2004, CITIC was being proposed by FMG as an equity investor in TPI, the successor to PIF, for the amount of $55.5m. Forrest was introduced to a Mr Lou-Lin (Lawrence) Xin (Xin), a Chinese businessman with experience in the iron ore industry by Mr K C Wong, who at that time was FMG's second largest shareholder, at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Beijing in April 2004. Xin told Forrest that, with one exception, all overseas investment by Chinese Contractors required NDRC approval although, for what it is worth, his impression then was that Forrest did not accept what he had told him. The exception, Xin mentioned, was in the case of CITIC which was directly owned by the Chinese Government and could accordingly make its own decisions about overseas investment. In late April 2004, FMG met with representatives of various Chinese entities, including the NDRC. FMG was informed that, amongst its roles, the NDRC was responsible for overseeing Chinese overseas investment and could assist FMG to identify Chinese investors and contractors. Subsequently, FMG wrote to the NDRC and other Chinese entities, referring to FMG's intention to involve Chinese investors, contractors, and equipment and service suppliers in the Project. In early 2004, FMG investigated and approached the Chinese authorities to understand what approvals would be required both for Chinese investment and Chinese contractor involvement with FMG. On 23 April 2004, FMG held a cocktail reception for Chinese parties at the Australian Embassy in Beijing, hosted by the Western Australian Minister for State Development. Numerous parties attended, including representatives of Chinese banks and contractors, along with Chinese government agency representatives such as Liu Xuhong (Mrs Liu), Deputy Director General (Foreign Capital Utilization Department) of the NDRC, and Wang, Director General of SASAC. Prior to the reception, the NDRC had requested information on FMG and its Project. Following the reception, a note was prepared by Rui Dana Du, Senior Business Analyst for FMG, in conjuction with David Liu concerning the discussions with the NDRC and SASAC. In that note, it was recorded that: (1) The division that Mrs Liu works at is very relevant to FMG's Project. This division is in charge of foreign investment in China and China's overseas investment. (2) Mrs Liu expressed the view that FMG's project would have great value and benefits to both Australia and China, and that NDRC was interested to learn more about the Project. (3) Mrs Liu requested more information about FMG and it was agreed that a further meeting would take place in the near future in Beijing. (4) Mrs Liu would be able to suggest whom FMG should speak to from NDRC (5) Wang of SASAC stated that FMG had \"a good project with a bright future\", and suggested a further meeting be held in Beijing. (6) Wang considered it would be best for FMG if the relevant interested Chinese entities (being steel mills, contractors and investors) formed a group (rather than being dealt with individually) as this consolidated approach would assist in obtaining the relevant approvals from the Chinese government. The actual approvals required were not stated. In the days following the Embassy function, FMG had further meetings in China with representatives from the NDRC and SASAC. At the meeting with the NDRC, Mrs Liu said that the NDRC would play a role with FMG if investments were to be made by Chinese companies in FMG. Mrs Liu said the NDRC would happily be involved in coordinating this process. She suggested that NDRC involvement occur through a work committee to identify investors and contractors. She stated that FMG would need to submit a detailed proposal about its intentions and the Project itself. At the meeting with SASAC, its representative stated that SASAC's role was to oversee the assets of the large state owned enterprises. The representative also said that in relation to the involvement of Chinese contractors, FMG would need to find a corporation to take the lead role, and that SASAC would be involved in coordination of the Chinese participation. The SASAC representative indicated that approvals for contracting would be dealt with by the MOC and investment would be dealt with by the NDRC. In May 2004, following these meetings in Beijing, FMG officers undertook further research into the question of the roles of these Chinese governmental agencies and the approvals that may be required. FMG officers prepared two PowerPoint presentations which set out the roles of various Chinese government agencies and the approvals that may be required for the involvement of the Chinese with the Project. The email, attaching the PowerPoint presentation, prepared by O'Reilly of FMG on 11 May 2004 noted that \"the big picture isn't that clear in China\", that the transition to the market economy has the processes \"in flux\", that the fact that any information that may hold more concrete \"nuts and bolts\" steps was in the Chinese language \"doesn't help\", and that \"[i]nterpretation is also a factor to take into account\". The PowerPoint presentation sets out the various stages for Chinese Project Development one of which is \"Government Approval\" and which also twice later refers to NDRC Approval, disclosing that body as involved with \"Chinese Investment\" and the MOC for Chinese contracting. This, it seems to me, is further evidence that FMG knew or ought reasonably to have known that NDRC approval for investment by Chinese entities such as CREC, CHEC and CMCC had to be obtained. The complete position was at that time, I accept, not entirely clear. FMG then drafted a 7 May 2004 written proposal to the NDRC. It mentioned that FMG had previously agreed with the NDRC that the best way forward would be to establish a Chinese Consortium under the auspices of the NDRC or its Overseas Association. It stated that FMG had, for its long term development strategy, vigorously pursued, amongst other things, potential Chinese participation by direct investment. This document proposed investment in FMG mines by Chinese steel mills and trading companies in the sum of $120m. It also proposed investment in the PIF which was to develop and operate the railway and port facilities; the proposed investment sums for infrastructure investors and iron ore customers being in the same amount of $191.25m. It then proposed that the Chinese consortium would cover both investment in FMG and contracting and that Chinese enterprises would be invited to take up a 10-20% shareholding in FMG. On 12 May 2004, Forrest was told by Kirchlechner, in an email, that according to the Senior Trade Commissioner of Austrade Beijing, the Foreign Capital Utilisation Department is the \" bit of NDRC that inserts it's (sic ) bib in investment overseas \" and was responsible for major foreign investment projects. On 13 May 2004, Rowley of FMG sent a letter to Bai of CREC stating: We strongly believe, as do the NDRC, MOC and SASAC, that the best and most effective competitive advantage for CREC against international contractors would be to create a Chinese consortium which would successfully deliver FMG's project to the highest international standards required On 18 May 2004, Forrest sent a letter to Mrs Liu of NDRC stating: FMG has focused on potential partnerships with Chinese companies from the very beginning. As one of the few major Western resource developers FMG intends to explore the extensive areas where we believe Chinese investors, contractors, equipment and service suppliers can play crucial roles. ... I have instructed my team to keep you fully informed of project progress and present a detailed report to NDRC about our intention to include Chinese investors and contractors for our project. FMG engaged at least two consultants in China to assist in its negotiations with potential investors, contractors and equipment and service providers. Those two consultants were Mr Bai (not Bai of CREC) and Mr Yin . On 18 May 2004, Forrest sent a letter to Mr Bai, the consultant, stating: ... I proposed to set up an advisory committee, initially consisting of Mr Yin, yourself and up to two other industry captains. We will then work together to structure and organise an overall Chinese participation in the project. We also envisage that the committee will assist in obtaining all relevant approvals from appropriate Chinese government agencies for the many potential Chinese corporations to contribute to the Project. On 20 May 2004, David Liu advised Forrest by email that negotiations were well underway to form a powerful consortium of investors and contractors under the auspices of the NDRC's National Overseas Investment Association. FMG prepared a second draft proposal to the NDRC on 8 July 2004. It was broadly in the same terms as the first draft. It continued to invite Chinese enterprises to invest in the shares of FMG so as to become key strategic partners on a long term basis, although it did not express this in percentage terms. I infer that FMG sent its proposal to the NDRC shortly after 8 July. On 21 July 2004, David Liu distributed to FMG executives, including Forrest, a proposal for a meeting with top officials of the NDRC in August in Beijing. That was a short document consisting of a background paragraph and a list of four points to be discussed at the meeting. The background was: BACKGROUND: FMG has made a request for Andrew (Forrest) to meet top officials (Ministerial Level) of the National Development and Reform Commission in August in Beijing. This is separate from the workshop to be co-sponsored by the NDRC and its affiliated Industry Overseas Investment Association. The Foreign Affairs Department of NDRC has contacted us for a list of points to be discussed at the official meeting, they then make a submission for the appropriate official to meet us. . . . The fourth point on the list included the statement that \"top Chinese level support is essential for the Chinese consortium, facilitated by the NDRC's Foreign Capital Utilisation Bureau and its affiliated Industry Overseas Investment Association\". In addition, it was stated that FMG would like to know more \"specifics\" about the NDRC's capacity to implement the Chinese national resource policies and co-ordination with other Government agencies. The CREC Framework Agreement was signed on 6 August 2004. It contains no provision concerning equity. Clause 5 provides that the agreement would become binding upon approval of the respective boards of CREC and FMG before 31 August 2004. The Agreement did not require NDRC approval or any other Chinese government approval. On 17 August 2004, Forrest, David Liu and Kirchlechner from FMG met with Mr He, the Deputy Director General (Foreign Capital Utilisation Department) of the NDRC. Mr He has the same job title as Mrs Liu, the NDRC official with whom FMG had previously met. It is not clear what the working relationship between Mr He and Mrs Liu was, but in any event, it appears that Mrs Liu took no further part in the discussions between FMG and the NDRC. The discussions were noted in a written report by Kirchlechner and in meeting notes prepared by David Liu contained in the China Trip Report. Forrest made specific mention of the agreement that FMG had entered into with CREC. At the meeting, Mr He advised that co-operation by the NDRC must allow Chinese investment not only in FMG's port and rail infrastructure but also in the mines. Forrest responded that only a minority interest in FMG or its mines was available and that no \"JV\" could ever challenge the sovereignty of Australia's interest in the mines. Mr He twice acknowledged that the Chinese entities would not seek majority control of FMG. Against that background Mr He stated that the NDRC would appoint \"two big companies\" to talk to FMG about making investments in FMG. The conclusion to David Liu's meeting notes stated: It is a very positive development for the supreme approval authority in China to express support for FMG and to take the trouble of recommending partners. While NDRC's initial recommendation may not turn out to be the best and final outcome, we do need to continue the dialogue and seek to obtain NDRC's agreement to whatever partner we may want to work with at the end. \"Co-operation\" by the NDRC amounted, in my view, to the grant of approval by NDRC for the CREC board to approve the CREC Framework Agreement and, at a later stage, approval by it for investment of Chinese finances into the construction of the railway by CREC. Although the CREC Framework Agreement was executed by the parties on 6 August 2004 it did not, by clause 5, become binding until approved by both the board of directors of CREC and that of FMG. In his oral testimony, Kirchlechner said that at this meeting the NDRC was distinctly interested in Chinese companies being involved in the Project and that Mr He expressed an interest in Chinese companies acquiring a percentage ownership in the mines or in FMG itself. Forrest emailed Watling on 18 August 2004 in which is included \"Waiting now with bated breath for NDRC sign off in the next 24 hours\". The email expressly refers to CHEC but I find that the \"sign-off\" mentioned related to CREC. I do so for a number of reasons. First the email is a response to one the same day from Watling which expressly refers to both CREC and CHEC. In it Watling suggests that Forrest contact CHEC with a view to it constructing the harbour. Forrest's reply deals with both companies although he only mentions CHEC expressly. Second, there was at that date nothing for the NDRC to \"sign off\" in relation to CHEC. Third, the hoped for approval by the board of CREC was to occur the following day, that is within 24 hours. For that to occur required, as I have found, approval first by the NDRC. Fourth CREC board approval was in fact given to the CREC Framework Agreement on 19 August 2004 followed later that day by the formal and prestigious signing ceremony. On 19 August 2004, FMG represented by Forrest and Kirchlechner also met with representatives of SASAC and the MOC at separate meetings. Meeting notes were prepared by FMG and these disclose what follows. The meeting with the MOC involved several Chinese companies relevant to FMG's Project, namely CREC, CMCC and China Development Bank. The meeting was conducted by a senior Chinese government officer of the MOC, being the Assistant Minister, Mr Chen Jian, who said there was support for China's companies to cooperate with foreign partners, especially Australia, and that FMG could make use of Chinese capital which explained the presence of a representative of the Chinese Development Bank at the meeting. He also said that Chinese companies were confident in their ability and would help keep capital costs low in order for FMG's products to enter the Chinese market. One of the concerns raised by Bai of CREC at the lunch on 23 August 2004 was that FMG needed to reach agreement with major Chinese steel mills for minority equity on its mines. According to the written trip report provided by David Liu, Bai said that these concerns were \"the real expediters for the project as far as the Chinese companies are concerned\" or words to that effect. I find that the need for equity to be provided was put to FMG by CREC as necessary to the performance of the CREC Framework Agreement. Thereafter CREC was looking to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Barclay Mowlem (BMCL) in relation to the Project. On 20 August 2004, Zhang of CREC sent an email to Heyting stating: we will complete discussion with BMCL people today to finalize our MOU as requested by them .... CREC will get due proposal or instruction from China government by the end of this month. i hope BMCL peolple (sic) can understand that the signing or not of the MOU will not soly (sic) mean success of mutual cooperation. This again suggests the involvement of the Chinese Government in approving foreign contracting and investment operations by Chinese companies. Heyting forwarded Zhang's email to Catlow, who forwarded it to Forrest stating: See reference to Govt approval. Is our CREC deal binding yet, or should we wait for NDRC involvement before announcing? On the same day, Forrest answered to Catlow: Confirmed with Mr Bai direct. Ours is binding. Apart from forwarding Zhang's email to Catlow, on 20 August 2004, Heyting also replied to Zhang stating: When you say 'get due proposal or instruction from China government by the end of this month', is this for the FMG/CREC agreement, the CREC/BMCL agreement or both? On the same day, Zhang replied: 'get due proposal or instruction from China government by the end of this month' is for the CREC/BMCL agreement... I do not regard these exchanges as altering the position that NDRC approval was required in relation to foreign investment by CREC, that is, the financing of the railway the subject of CREC Framework Agreement. The need for this did not affect the view of both FMG and CREC that they had executed a binding build and transfer agreement for the construction of the railway infrastructure. FMG then met with representatives of Chinese companies Shanghai Baosteel Group on 20 August 2004 and Sinosteel on 22 August 2004 and discussed the issue of investment in FMG. The meetings were attended by Forrest, David Liu and Kirchlechner. At these meetings, the Chinese representatives said that it was too early to talk about investment in FMG. However, a letter of intent was entered into between FMG and Sinosteel on 23 August 2004 by which the parties agreed to negotiate in good faith a long-term agreement that would include supply guarantee, off-take guarantee, and investment or financing. The letter of intent also referred to FMG and Sinosteel continuing discussions about \"investing in the project\". David Liu sent an email to other FMG officers dated 24 August 2004 in which he comments on a discussion he had with Bai of CREC following the signing ceremony for the CREC Framework Agreement. Liu had earlier referred to this in his August Trip Report. In that email Liu noted that during the farewell lunch hosted by him, Bai made a number of points with regard to the \"next steps\" by CREC and FMG. One of these points was as follows: [i]n order to expedite the more substantive involvement of CREC and other contractors like CHEC and (C)MCC ... FMG needs to reach agreement with Chinese steel company(s) on Chinese investment into minority equity of FMG mine(s). This policy was clearly stated to FMG team by the Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce and will greatly facilitate the Chinese contractors to acquire financing for BT. (This is the most important point of all). This was, in part, different to what Mr He had said to Forrest at the 17 August 2004 meeting. However, the form of equity was clearly to be \"minority equity\" at least in an FMG mine or mines. FMG submits that the email discloses that reaching agreement on equity is connected with expediting the more substantive involvement of CREC and facilitating the Chinese Contractors in acquiring finance for the BT but that reaching agreement on equity is not stated to be a precondition, or condition subsequent, to the implementation or performance of the CREC Framework Agreement. Such may have been the position contractually. However, at a practical level, there can be no doubt that the position of CREC and NDRC was that without agreement on minority equity, whether in the mine(s) or otherwise the rail infrastructure project would not proceed. In his letter to CREC dated 31 August 2004 in response to the issue raised by Mr Bai as to the need for FMG to reach agreement with Chinese steel mills on equity, Forrest responded relevantly as follows: 1. Minority equity participation in an FMG's mine by Chinese steel mills. As we explained to Mr He of the National Development and Reform Commission, Fortescue Metals welcomes equity participation by Chinese steel mills in an FMG mine. We have been encouraging Chinese entities to invest in our project from the outset, and indeed all of our Memoranda of Intent with customers include an investment clause. Forrest did not directly acknowledge that the provision of equity was a prerequisite to \"co-operation\", or \"approval\" for the CREC Framework Agreement to be implemented. Rather, he seems to treat the provision of equity as a formality, it being something which both sides wanted. There is nothing to suggest that the necessary agreement concerning equity could not or would not be reached and, at that time, every reason for FMG to think that agreement would be reached. In that sense Chinese implementation or performance of the CREC Framework Agreement was not in question. By facsimile letter dated 27 August 2004, Mr He of the NDRC wrote to FMG concerning the meeting that had occurred with FMG on 17 August 2004. Mr He suggested that FMG continue to contact Chinese steel mills, and \"as the relevant conditions mature\" that NDRC would organise coordination as well as expedite co-operation between FMG and Chinese steel mills. This information was relayed to other persons at FMG by David Liu on Monday, 30 August 2004. FMG responded to this facsimile on 2 September 2004, stating that FMG would engage Chinese steel mills in discussion along the spirit of the meeting at NDRC; and that as was agreed, FMG would commit to cooperating with the Chinese Contractors to successfully complete its significant resource project in Australia, taking full advantage of the latest Chinese technology and capability in rail, port and mines. On 26 September 2004, David Liu reported to Forrest, by an email entitled \"Last Few Days in China\", about a dinner meeting he had with two senior representatives of the NDRC (Overseas Investment Association), that: 5) OVERSEAS INVESTMENT ASSOCIATION I invited two senior representatives for dinner. They apologised for not being able to organise the work shop earlier. Mr He is in Russia with the Premier. From the way they talked, they all had a fair bit of reverence for Mr He. Although the association is set up under NDRC, it is only one year old and is still finding its appropriate roles. They asked me if we could give them the names of interested Chinese steel mills in FMG, so that the association could organise them together to visit FMG and approval [sic] them in one go for investment and so on. I think it would be an interesting alternative for FMG, which we need to think carefully, maybe you could take it up with Mr He when you see him next month. Forrest wrote to the NDRC on 13 October 2004 in which he referred both to the question of equity and the progression of discussions with CHEC and CMCC. The letter included the following: FMG has been as per your instruction at our last meeting in Beijing undertaking a series of serious negotiations with major Chinese steel companies on the establishment of strategic partnership, and we envisage there will be some substantial result in the near future. In addition, we have just received the senior delegation from China Harbour Engineering Corporation, and will welcome shortly visitors from China Metallurgical Construction Corporation to visit FMG and proposed project sites. They have all indicated that your assistance has been essential in organising the Chinese Alliance for participating FMG's major resource project, for which I feel deeply obliged. ... The local and international construction companies and equipment suppliers have expressed to FMG strong interest in assisting the Chinese Alliance wherever they can for the project in Pilbara. Mr He, if and when it is convenient for you and your colleagues, it would be my honour to coordinate with relevant State and Federal government representatives to send you an invitation for a comprehensive visit to Fortescue Metals Group. By the time the CHEC and CMCC agreements were being discussed, FMG and the Chinese Contractors knew that the matter of Chinese government approvals was being directly handled by the NDRC in its direct discussions with FMG. FMG submits that a salient indication of FMG's understanding of the position of the NDRC at this time is demonstrated by David Liu's short paper entitled THE CHINESE SITUATION that was circulated to Forrest and other senior FMG personnel by email on 9 October 2004. It says that this document makes it clear that FMG understood that Mr He's primary objective was to organise the \"Chinese Alliance\" for the Project (a reference to the involvement of the Chinese Contractors) \"in addition to coordinating for a Chinese steel mill or two to participate in minority equity on a FMG mine \" (emphasis added). I do not, however, think this detracts from the clear expressions by Mr He of the NDRC and Bai of CREC that investment by any Chinese organisation in FMG would require NDRC approval which in turn was dependent upon provision of minority equity to, at that time, a Chinese steel mill(s). Zhang of CREC informed Heyting by email on 18 October 2004 as follows: In China, CREC have kept our commitments to work very hard on financing issues, promoting and organizing CHEC and MCC to move forward, a lot of communication with NDRC and Mofcom to clear off any possible and potential obstacles ... MCC is a reference to CMCC, and Mofcom to MOC. FMG submits that it was entitled to assume that any NDRC approvals that may be required by the Chinese entities for the framework agreements were matters which were in hand. I accept that to be the case in respect to the NDRC approval for the boards of the Chinese Contractors to approve the framework agreements and thereby render them binding but that still left the need for approval by the NDRC for actual financial investment. However, in respect to the latter, I find that FMG was justified in thinking that this would be a formality for reasons I have explained. Xin, the Chinese business associate of Mr K C Wong who had first told Forrest about the need for NDRC approval in April 2004, was called by FMG as a witness. He had considerable business experience with the Chinese government. He said that prior to their execution the framework agreements must already have been approved at some level by the NDRC. He was cross-examined about a conversation he had with Mr He of NDRC in the course of a lunch in Beijing on 9 April 2005. Xin had known Mr He for more than 40 years. He described Mr He as \"difficult to deal with\", with a reputation within the Australian mining industry of \"being nasty\". At the time of the lunch Mr He knew that Xin was in negotiations to become an FMG consultant. Xin said in his witness statement that Mr He told him in April 2005 that CREC, CHEC and CMCC did not themselves have the funds to finance the FMG project and therefore they required State approval for the contracts to be performed. The following exchange in cross-examination occurred. Again, I have edited this portion of the transcript by attributing to the text the names of the speakers for clarity. MR YOUNG: Mr Xin, you knew yourself that at all times an agreement to spend $2 billion in an overseas project was always subject to NDRC approval, didn't you? MR XIN: Yes, I - yes. But also I knew unless these three entities got some approval beforehand, they wouldn't sign anything. I mean, the previous - the agreements they signed, they have got approval from NDRC beforehand. MR YOUNG: Who told you that? MR XIN: He (Mr He) told me that. Because otherwise - I mean, this is State-owned enterprises. They don't dare to sign anything unless there is some higher authority approval given already. But as I said, there's a phased application, sort of. Initially, they would tell NDRC: we intend to do such and such a thing, so on and so forth, but every company have their own timetable, or whatever. They apply - unless they got approval - preliminary approval from State NDRC, they wouldn't dare to sign anything. This evidence is further support for my conclusion that there was a need for approval at not only the contractual level but also at the investment level. There is other supporting material. Li of FMG emailed Rowley on 22 October 2004 advising as follows: Due to the rule from Ministry of Commerce, for CREC to be able to carry out the BT contract with FMG, it needs to see some Chinese company to be the share holder of the mine. This is not only to CREC, this is the rule for all this type of project. As such, CREC has been actively working on this issue: Mr Zhang is still trying hard to convince (C)MCC to be the share holder of FMG mines. It seems, however, that in the approval process the NDRC was a superior authority to the MOC. In an email from David Liu to Forrest of 27 October 2004 he noted advice from Ma of CMCC that as the \"BT\" involved over US $100m, the normal responsibility which belonged to the MOC suddenly involved more agencies like the NDRC. The email also seems to indicate that Mr He of the NDRC had nominated CMCC as the entity to undertake the joint venture or equity participation in FMG to the exclusion of Chinese steel mills. ASIC contends, based on the evidence of Li, that on 6 November 2004, the day following the signing ceremony, Forrest on behalf of FMG made an agreement with Yang of CMCC that FMG would grant CMCC a 30% equity interest in the Project as a precondition of CREC, CHEC and CMCC constructing the infrastructure necessary for the Project. FMG denies that any such agreement was reached. \"Project\" is defined in ASC [3] as \"a business which is the development of an iron ore and infrastructure project in the Pilbara\". FMG denies any such agreement and points to there being no mention of equity in the framework agreements nor in the terms of the draft advanced framework agreements dated late October and early November 2004, upon which ASIC relies. I do not, for reasons already explained, regard this omission as decisive. However, Li's evidence is inconsistent with the documentary evidence. Li was employed as an engineer at FMG, who occasionally acted as a translator at meetings. Li agreed in cross-examination that \"most time\" she was not involved in negotiations with the Chinese entities, and that she was not generally involved in the letters and emails concerning these negotiations. She also accepted that, in her email of 22 October 2004, the reference to a Chinese entity obtaining an equity interest (as stated by Zhang of CREC) related to FMG mines, not FMG itself. In cross-examination she said \"... in my mind I thought it was FMG, because FMG is wholly listed on the market, so about 30 per cent\". She eventually stated in respect of the kind of equity interest that \"[a]ccording to my memory, I don't think it was specified during the negotiation\". There is no contemporaneous record of this alleged significant oral agreement. However, importantly, there is an FMG record, close to the time of these events that bears upon a similar subject matter. A teleconference was held on 25 November 2004 involving Forrest and David Liu of FMG and Ma, President of CMCC. The note of the discussions contained in an email from David Liu to Forrest dated 25 November 2004 records the following: 5) Ma mentioned again (last teleconference in China) that Chinese consortium led by MCC would like to take majority equity in the mine. AF said straight away that this project would never be majority owned by foreign interests and would not be possible in any event. AF stressed that FMG agreed with the NDRC for a minority interest of 15%, and only agreed later with Mr Yang, Chairman of (C)MCC for a 25 ? 30% interest in a mine for 250 mt ore resource to speed resolution (for US$200m). Mr Ma replied that we should discuss the details later. I do not accept Li as a reliable witness on this issue and prefer the version which emerges from the documentary evidence. I conclude that Li was confused as to the matter of the 30% interest discussed with Yang of CMCC. It was not an equity interest in the Project as the pleading put it, nor a shareholding in FMG as Li at one stage in her oral testimony put it, but rather a 25% or 30% interest to be taken in an FMG mine for 250 mt ore resource for US$200m. Indeed Li's email of 22 October 2004 also refers, as I observed, to an interest in FMG mines. FMG submits that this offer was clearly made independently of the framework agreements, and that there is no credible evidence that the performance of these agreements was conditional upon the acquisition by any Chinese entity of an equity stake in FMG or any of its assets and that this is made apparent and beyond question from the express terms of the framework agreements. I accept this to be the position according to the express terms of the framework agreements and that FMG reasonably considered the matters of approval and equity as separate from the parties' obligations under the framework agreements. That this was FMG's position is evidenced, for example, when FMG took the matter up with the Minister for Trade. On 7 March 2005, Russell Scrimshaw, an FMG director, sent a briefing prepared for the Minister, Mr Vaile, to Pat Farmer, Assistant Minister for Education, who was asked to forward the briefing to Mr Vaile. The briefing included the following summary: Fortescue has been discussing various commercial arrangements with the Chinese Government and Chinese agencies since early 2003. These discussions have resulted in several agreements whereby certain Chinese state owned construction companies have agreed to fund and construct the Fortescue iron ore project (China Build & Transfer Agreements). In the 2H of 2004 the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has attempted to intervene in many of these discussions. Since the signing of the Build & Transfer agreements in November 2004, the NDRC have reverted to Fortescue with a request for equity in the project. They have appointed China Metallurgical as their designated negotiator. There have been various proposals passed back and forth but no agreement. At times, China Metallurgical has tried to link to the China Build and Transfer Agreements to the sale of equity in Fortescue's projects. This linkage has been suggested despite this never being part of the original deal. This briefing paper contains a reference to Mr He directing CREC, CHEC, CMCC and Chinese steel mills not to advance their contractual relationships with FMG until FMG met his demands for a Chinese majority joint venture interest of between 80-90%. The letter concluded by a request to the Minister to protest strongly on behalf of FMG and to specifically call upon the NDRC to immediately cease from inducing the Chinese parties to breach contract. However FMG was dealing with Chinese interests and, as I have found, knew as a matter of commercial reality that NDRC approval was necessary at broadly two levels: first contractual then provision of finance for performance. It obtained the first and expected, reasonably in my view, that the second was a formality. The only requirement was a Chinese enterprise, probably by then CMCC, obtaining a minority equity interest in an FMG mine. After the three framework agreements had been executed events took a very unexpected turn. By 20 and 25 November 2004 CMCC started speaking in terms of obtaining a majority interest in the Project. This is evident from the teleconference notes of discussions between CMCC Vice President, Wang, and FMG representatives, Watling and David Liu, on 20 November 2004 and the teleconference between CMCC's President, Ma, and FMG representatives, Forrest and Liu, on 25 November 2004. The notes of the 25 November teleconference include the following: Mr Ma informed AF that NDRC had convened a meeting with CREC, (C)MCC, CHEC and others. At the meeting, (C)MCC was appointed \"point of contact\" for Fortescue on behalf of the Chinese companies on discussion of equity investment, including quick financing and marketing right in China. \"Majority Equity\" is the basis on which other aspects of Chinese participation will be built, and Mr Ma mentioned that this principal had indeed reached the \"sky level\", meaning obviously high level top Chinese government officials. David Liu was contacted by Zhang of CREC on 25 November 2004, the same day as the teleconference that had occurred between Forrest and Ma of CMCC. Zhang wanted to find out how things were going with CMCC and further stated that \"while FMG should consider giving up a bit, ( C)MCC should certainly not have its own way\". This is entirely consistent with the evidence given by ASIC's witness, Kirchlechner, who recounts in his witness statement that in December 2004, during a visit by CMCC representatives to Perth, he was informed by Rowley that CMCC wanted to obtain 80% equity in FMG's Project. Kirchlechner informed Rowley that \"this is only a bargaining position and not their final position and them wanting equity is not unexpected\". Significantly, despite the negotiating position adopted by CMCC during this trip to Perth, a CMCC representative was involved in technical sessions with FMG officers and Worley representatives, dealing with geological and processing plant issues. While CMCC was making demands for majority equity in FMG or its mines, representatives of CREC continued to encourage FMG that CREC was in a position to implement the Project, regardless of the outcome of the equity negotiations with CMCC. In David Liu's email to FMG representatives of 29 December 2004, he stated: Like last time to Alan (Watling) in Beijing, Mr Bai again expressed strong position of CREC that China Rail would push ahead regardless of the outcome of the equity negotiation between FMG and MCC. He would like us to send him a fax asap based on the copy provided earlier by CREC, so that he could send his engineers here without being accused of disobeying NDRC (CREC is to fund its own engineers despite the wording). If a group of engineers came to stay here in the near future, there might be a real likelihood of ? parallel process? ? BT contracting and Equity Negotiation, hence part of the competitive tensions so desired by FMG. Mr Bai believed that CREC would, with its connections and capacity, find the financing one way or another despite NDRC to carry out BT for FMG. CHEC has not shown much initiative to bypass this (C)MCC formula. Maybe this could hurry them up a bit. In discussions and meetings between CMCC, and various other Chinese representatives, and FMG in January 2005 CMCC sought 80% of the equity in the Project. Further, the Chinese initially, and for the first time, asserted that there were no commitments on their side to do anything under the framework agreements, which was inconsistent with the way in which the Chinese entities, especially CREC, had conducted themselves up to this point. On Sunday 16 January 2005, a Chinese delegation including representatives of CMCC and CHEC met with the FMG representatives Huston, Watling and David Liu in the FMG boardroom in Perth. Fisher, a Chinese speaking executive assistant, took minutes of the meeting and emailed them to the FMG representatives and Forrest. The minutes record Mr Zou Wei Min, General Manager of CMCC, saying: ...the purpose of his trip is to show FMG that China is serious and has gathered a team of important people to come here to dealing with us. Had no intention of delay the project. The minutes also state: \"There were three main issues to be settled:\" but go on to list four issues, namely: 1. Equity size 2. Area of tenements 3. Agency of Marketing 4. Value --- Price (left out) This statement then follows: China has strong interest to do business with FMG, like to take equity of the mine, not just the project. The minutes also record the Chinese method for calculating the value of the whole project and resource, a method said to be used by the Chinese in relation to their copper project investments in other countries, and which took into account past and future exploration costs, due diligence and \"existing resource\". Mr Sun Longjun (Sun), Second Business Department Manager of CMCC, was recorded asking when the DFS would be available and stating that: \"With out (sic) the DFS no need to commit any work\". When reminded by Watling about the framework agreements, the response was: \"BT agreements can only be committed if the DFS is available. \" This, as I have mentioned before, was evident both to the parties and to the market. Huston was recorded as saying that \"the max hold of equity is 30%\". The minutes conclude with the comment: Meeting ended with the decision to have another meeting on Monday morning 9AM to out line of schedule of what need to be done in the next three to four months When CMCC's chairman expressed the view to FMG, at the meeting held on 17 January 2005, that the CMCC Framework Agreement was an \"MOU\", the minutes record the following relevant exchange taking place, in which the Chairman resiled from that position: AF raised the question about whether China side intend to honour the agreement signed in November 04, the reply was it was only a \"MOU\". But when Andrew mentioned that FMG and China consortium relationship should change, FMG would treat China side as a commercial contractor only, Ma's reaction was no change please, China will cooperate, and China never said that not to carry out the agreement, but we don't have enough information about the project; Don't worried about time, as China did a lot of large projects, time is nothing can be caught up very soon. As it is a large sum of investment, the China consortium has now included the Chinese Banks as well. Carrying out the BT contract is no problem, just have FMG appoint three personnel respectively in charge of the Rail, Mine and Port Infrastructure, and China side will get three equivalent personnel push forward the works of the contracts. Fisher was called by ASIC as a witness. She explained in her statement and her evidence that she had been dismissed from FMG. In her statement she said that she had been very upset by the discussion in which she was terminated. FMG submits that she presented as a witness who was purposely adverse to FMG's interests in the litigation, and that her evidence is unreliable. Fisher gave evidence of the meeting of 17 January 2005 and as to the passage from the minutes referred to above. She said that where she had recorded the word \"agreement\" spoken by Ma that, in fact, Ma had stated \"MOU\" in Chinese. I do not accept this evidence, particularly given that Fisher has in the same document separately translated from Mr Ma's discussion in Chinese the word \"MOU\" in the first paragraph and \"agreement\" in the next. Further, when asked about the reference to \"BT contract\" in the last paragraph, she appeared to agree that it was not an MOU and it was a \"separate one\". The Chinese suggestion at the 17 January meeting that the framework agreements were merely MOUs was, I find, a negotiating tactic. It did not represent their true view as to the legal effect of these agreements. When Forrest mentioned that the consortium relationship between FMG and the Chinese should change, and that FMG would treat the Chinese companies as commercial contractors only, they retreated and agreed that the framework agreements would be performed. The issue of majority equity was an ambit claim by the Chinese. The desire for equity from the Chinese was part of the negotiations. There was, in my opinion, no requirement for FMG to have disclosed such negotiations. That they did not disclose them did not render FMG's disclosures as to the legal effect of the framework agreements misleading or deceptive. FMG wrote by facsimile to CMCC on 20 January 2005 naming three divisional heads, Rowley, Watling and Heyting to expedite the optimal design process for the Project. CMCC had agreed to provide its own three divisional heads for that purpose. Consistently with the above, when FMG visited CMCC and CREC in China in late January 2005, each understood the need for urgency in the design works and indicated that they intended to commit engineering resources to come to Perth in the near future. Sun of CMCC is also quoted in the FMG trip record as expressing \"his personal view that CREC had committed to the BT agreements at a far too early stage\". In its facsimile of 20 January 2005, FMG also put forward proposals to CMCC offering a \"30% stake in the resources of FMG\" with the offer to remain open for 21 calendar days which ultimately were not accepted. On 26 January 2005 CMCC responded to FMG's letter of 20 January 2005, again seeking an 80% interest in the Project. On 28 January 2005, FMG wrote to Yang of CMCC with copies to Ma of CMCC as well as to the presidents of CREC (Qin) and CHEC (Liu Huai Yuan) and Mr He of the NDRC, confirming the understanding, derived from the earlier visit of Ma to Perth, that the spirit of the framework agreements remained and would not be interrupted by the request for FMG to consider equity. FMG also gave notice that it required the framework agreements to be performed including the negotiation of the fuller and more detailed agreement contemplated by the framework agreements. By the letter, FMG provided formal notification that: the 10% deposit funds required under Section 3 of our BT Agreement will be made available to China Railway Engineering Corporation, China Harbour Engineering Company, China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (\"the Chinese Contractors\") immediately the Chinese Contractors form the detailed Agreement with Fortescue Metals foreshadowed in Clause 7 of the BT Agreement. FMG representatives met with CMCC in China in late January 2005, and FMG reiterated its commitment to move forward with the Project in line with the framework agreements as well as its willingness to pay the 10% deposit. It suggested that the equity issue should be resolved in parallel and that the equity negotiations should not in any way obstruct the earlier agreed relationships between the BT contractors and FMG. As part of the meetings attended by FMG in China, CREC indicated that, provided the 10% deposit contemplated by the framework agreement was paid, CREC would be able to commence implementation of the rail project despite the issues involving CMCC and the NDRC. FMG took steps to be in a position to pay the 10% deposit. It did this by meeting with GE Commercial Finance in February 2005 and receiving an outline on 1 March 2005 of the terms upon which that company would be prepared to loan $185m, representing 10% of the cost of the Chinese Contractors carrying out the construction of the Project infrastructure. However ASIC submits that these suggestions that Bai of CREC would push ahead regardless of the views of the NDRC and the outcome of equity negotiations were totally unrealistic and that FMG knew that to be the case. There is however evidence to which I have referred that CREC was expressing its willingness to proceed with its agreement with FMG despite the changed position taken on equity by Mr He of the NDRC. David Liu, in his email to Mr Forrest of 25 November 2004 which I referred to earlier in the context of the NDRC demands through CMCC for a majority interest in FMG, advised that Zhang of CREC informed him, in effect, that CREC was \"smarting in a big way\". I infer that this was because of the changed position on equity taken by Mr He which negatively affected CREC. Indeed CREC's commitment to the performance of the framework agreement continued well into 2005 when in a letter from Bai to FMG dated 29 June 2005 he wrote: As per our several meetings recently in China, hereby we highlight the intention to meet the obligation of the existing binding Build&Transfer Agreement dated 6 August 2004 for FMG Project and confirm the intention to undertake the design/ engineering works together, planned to begin in July 05. An email from David Liu to Watling, Forrest and others of 29 December 2004 is yet another example of this. There were obviously tensions between CREC and the NDRC. No doubt CREC wanted very much to build the railway. The NDRC, and perhaps more particularly Mr He of the NDRC, had its own agenda. CREC thought it had the necessary \"connections and capacity\", as David Liu described it in his email, to obtain the necessary finance. A political struggle for ascendancy loomed. Despite this, I remain of the view that performance of each of the three framework agreements was subject, in a policy sense within the Chinese commercial context, to NDRC approval. It had already been given for the execution of each agreement. NDRC approval for finances to be committed by the Chinese Contractors was required. Following the unexpected demand by Mr He of the NDRC, which contravened its clear agreement, through Mr He, with FMG, that only a minority stake would be required, this further approval now faced an obstacle. It was an obstacle which FMG and indeed CREC thought could be overcome through negotiation. I find that the NDRC's demands for majority equity were treated, on reasonable grounds by FMG, as no more than a stratagem to extract a controlling equity position contrary to what had earlier been agreed. There may even have been legal remedies within the Chinese legal system to force the NDRC to honour its earlier commitment. Fisher in her statement said that on about 3 February 2005 she recalls seeing a fax sent to FMG by CMCC and that the content of the fax was to the effect that the deal with CMCC was off. No such document has been discovered by FMG, nor is there any evidence which supports that of Fisher. There is no correspondence between the parties that refers to a facsimile dated on or about 3 February 2005. There are further communications between CMCC and FMG in relation to a possible agreement on equity, which are inconsistent with CMCC having \"called off the deal\" on about 3 February 2005. I do not accept Fisher's evidence in this respect. By letter from FMG to CMCC dated 10 February 2005, FMG withdrew its equity offer of 20 January 2005. By letter from FMG to the NDRC dated 1 March 2005 and signed by Forrest, FMG recounted the exchange of proposals between FMG and CMCC, and re-stated its commitment to the BT agreements, but noted that time was progressing and that FMG would need to take steps to involve other parties in the project if agreement could not be reached with the Chinese on equity. In this letter it was also stated that FMG had decided to appoint Citigroup, the global investment bank, to conduct an international tender for the sale of a minority equity investment in the Project. On 12 March 2005, Mr He of the NDRC and CMCC representatives met with Forrest and David Liu at the Chairmans Lounge at Perth Domestic Airport. The minutes of that meeting, prepared by Liu , disclose that Mr He stated that it was the first time that he had heard FMG state that majority equity was not available. Liu responded by reminding Mr He that Forrest had clearly stated this at the meeting with him (Mr He) in Beijing on 17 August 2004, and that Mr He had expressly acknowledged on two occasions in that meeting that China was not seeking majority control of FMG. The minutes do not record any disavowal by Mr He of the correctness of this. Indeed, Mr He's only response was to say that, now that the equity position of FMG was clear, he would \"take it back home and discuss an alternative way of cooperation. \" Subsequently, CMCC sent a fax to Rowley at FMG on 17 March 2005. There were ongoing discussions about various matters, including equity. It was suggested that Forrest should come to Beijing with his expert term to negotiate separately the issues of equity and the technical side of the proposal on the basis of what was put by Ma at the meeting in Perth on 16 January 2005. On 22 March 2005 Rowley wrote to Wang at CMCC confirming again in respect of the equity issue that the 10% cash deposit was available to be paid by FMG pursuant to the CMCC Framework Agreement. He also referred to the interest shown by CMCC in a minority joint venture partnership in Christmas Creek. CMCC's most recent proposal prior to 22 March 2005 concerned equity in a mine. Rowley confirmed that Citigroup had been appointed to determine a fair market value for that equity. Irrespective of these negotiations as to equity, Rowley stated: We therefore look forward very much to the three BT contracts being fulfilled in accordance with the original timing agreed to by all four parties (Fortescue and China Railway Engineering Corporation, Fortescue and China Rail Engineering Corporation and Fortescue and China Metallurgical Construction (Group) Corporation (\"MCC\")) and hope to receive your confirmation that this will happen. This is a clear statement that, just before the AFR Article of 24 March 2005, FMG honestly believed that the framework agreements would be fulfilled by the three Chinese Contractors and that the Chinese would be taking up a minority equity in an FMG mine. The \"alternative way of cooperation\" fixed on by Mr He, upon his return to China, was to cause information to be provided to the Australian Financial Review newspaper with a view to it being published. FMG submits that in doing so, he provided an array of misinformation. The Australian Financial Review published an article concerning the framework agreements in its edition published over the Easter period of 24-28 March 2005. The fact that the article was published two days after Rowley's letter of 22 March 2005 suggests that it was possibly the day after receiving his letter that Mr He initiated contact with the AFR in Shanghai to convey the information, later recorded in the article. The AFR Article contained a number of very negative assertions concerning the Project. Significantly, it did not include a statement to the effect that the framework agreements had not been approved by the NDRC. These included assertions that the Project lacked adequate ore reserves; had no firm iron ore sales contracts; and had inadequate iron-ore resource and geological data. The article attributed these assertions to Mr Shen Heting (Shen), the new president of CMCC. Most importantly the article stated that Shen, spokesman for all three of the Chinese Contractors, denied there were any binding contracts with FMG that tied the Chinese Contractors into funding and constructing infrastructure and that CMCC had legal advice to that effect. Importantly too, in the context of the article Mr Shen is reported to have said that \"the Chinese groups would not pursue the project unless they could acquire a majority equity interest in it\". The defendants submit that CMCC, by inference, at the behest of Mr He, released this information to the AFR as a negotiating tactic directed to achieving its post-contractual aim of obtaining a majority equity interest in the Project. I find that this was the case for the following reasons. The AFR Article caused considerable public commercial distress to FMG. This, I find, was Mr He's intention. The media commentary, which was considerable, mentioned each of the negative matters raised in the AFR Article, not just the matter of the absence of any legal commitment to proceed. In some reports, the question of legal commitment was not mentioned at all. FMG's response to the AFR Article is relevant to the honesty of its belief that the framework agreements were binding build and transfer agreements. FMG responded to the AFR Article on 29 March 2005 by writing to the ASX. The early closure of the ASX for Easter meant that a response to the market about the AFR Article had not been possible earlier. In the second paragraph of its letter FMG states that the Chinese had purported to link performance under the CMCC Framework Agreement with its obtaining an acceptable equity interest but that FMG denied any such link. It stated that CMCC's contractual obligations were not conditional upon obtaining such an equity interest. FMG also pointed out that it still stood ready to implement the framework agreement with CMCC; that it had been in negotiations with CMCC concerning the acquisition of a significant equity interest; and that there had been no discussion about an equity interest for CMCC prior to the agreements being executed and nor was equity mentioned in the framework agreements. FMG said that it hoped that CMCC's strategy to link equity participation with commencement of its construction agreement obligations would not cause delays and that it was encouraged by CMCC's desire to purchase an equity interest. Further, FMG asserted that CMCC's approach to the Australian media was part of a negotiation strategy. Over the next two days FMG released copies of the three framework agreements to the market in Australia. There was no media criticism of FMG's letter generally or its particular assertion that the approach to the Australian Financial Review was a negotiating strategy. There was no challenge to the veracity of this assertion. ASIC does not contend that release of the letter to the ASX amounted to any contravention. There was media analysis which was consistent with the FMG release. In an article published in The Australian on 30 March 2005, Robin Bromby and Catherine Armitage stated: Relations between Mr Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group and China Metallurgical have been rocked by last week's attack by the Chinese on the viability of Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore project. The comments, seen by observers as a tactic to force down Fortescue's shares to snare a bigger stake in the project, carved $280 million off the company's value before trading was suspended on Thursday. The article also observed, concerning statements made by Forrest: Without naming China Metallurgical, he tore into the company at a press briefing, accusing the Chinese group of trying to gain a negotiating advantage and fostering a whispering campaign... Mr Forrest insisted the agreement with China Metallurgical was binding. On 30 March 2005 Forrest wrote to Mr He of the NDRC, in effect challenging him as to what he had done. He asked whether the position adopted by CMCC in the AFR Article was the Chinese Government's official response to the earlier discussion at the Perth Airport or whether it was just positioning on CMCC's part in anticipation of possible negotiations between FMG and CMCC. Mr He, rather tellingly, did not reply. Indeed, the next correspondence from China was a letter dated 29 June 2005 from Bai of CREC to Forrest concerning the \"FMG Project\". Bai referred to several meetings between them recently in China and advised: ... we highlight the intention to meet the obligations of the existing binding Build & Transfer Agreement dated 6 th August 2004 for FMG Project and confirm the intention to undertake the design/engineering works together, planned to begin in July 05. The \"existing binding Build & Transfer Agreement dated 6 th August 2004\" was the CREC Framework Agreement. However, about six weeks prior on 18 May 2005, Forrest met with the Chinese Ambassador Madam Fu Ying. The report on the meeting states: AF (Forrest) touched on the subject of trust. FMG had always provided Chinese partners with up to date information and previously it had been agreed both sides would work together to complete the feasibility study. (C)MCC talking to the Australian media was a complete surprise, given that the Project was important for both countries and as indicated to Mr He of NDRC FMG had always given China priority... Madam Fu...confirmed that (C)MCC was the authorised company with multiple Chinese partners and more importantly got the clearance from NDRC to cooperate with FMG...Her view was that we needed to repair the damaged image and work together with (C)MCC on the details. (C)MCC according to her conversation with Mr Wang was just as eager to move forward as FMG. FMG's position concerning the AFR Article was also made clear in the file notes of Mr Walsh of the ASX dated 24 March 2005, the very day the AFR Article was published which he confirmed in cross-examination. Campbell of FMG told him that the Chinese were demanding 80% of the joint venture and that they were using the AFR Article as a way to pressure FMG. The connection between FMG's refusal to grant majority equity and the involvement of the Australian Financial Review by Mr He is supported by the evidence of FMG's witness Xin, a consultant to FMG and a childhood friend of Mr He. Xin explained in his statement that Mr He informed him in late February 2005 that: the Chinese companies wanted control of FMG and as FMG was resisting, we would teach them a lesson. Xin's evidence is, in turn, supported by the contemporaneous records of FMG. FMG's business records show that on 3 March 2005, David Liu was contacted by Xin and informed that Mr He had spoken about \"FMG's recent moves\" by using the word \"Jiaoban\", which was noted by David Liu as being a \"harsh version of 'raising the argument'. \" Xin similarly described Mr He's statement as follows: ... He, at that time, when I talked with him he used the Chinese words called the \"zhou han\", which is very unusual. He said Andrew \"bu shi\" - Forrest \"shao han zhou han\". That means that's a semi-underground word. That means in my territory somebody try to challenge me. ... He used a word, very offensive, whatever, that means \"zhou han\" means, you know - normally it's a Mafia or underground word. So I thought he is very hostile. So I told Andrew, I said, \"You're in trouble,\" so he is so angry at you people. Xin gave evidence of a lunch meeting he had with Mr He on 9 April 2005 in Beijing, after accepting a twelve month consultancy appointment with FMG to assist with its dealings with NDRC. He gave evidence under cross-examination that at this meeting Mr He had told him, in effect, that the Chinese Contractors had each made an agreement but that the NDRC had later intervened to change the position. This as I have found, is exactly what occurred. In November, after execution of the three framework agreements, Mr He who had acknowledged in August 2004 that all that was required was a minority interest changed this to a demand for a majority interest. Xin said that during the April 2005 meeting Mr He told him that: ... those three companies are stupid. They tried to spend money and they only got some general contracts, and, you know, if we spend this sort of money, we should have control. In his witness statement at [16] Xin also said: In relation to the CREC, CHEC and (C)MCC contracts, Mr He said that NDRC considered it a pre-condition to the contracts and the deal proceeding that (C)MCC obtain majority control of FMG. Mr He told me that (C)MCC's comments that there was inadequate geological information was an excuse. Xin said that he had tried to persuade Mr He to honour the (framework) agreements but Mr He's response was the situation had changed and, irrespective of these agreements, China had to obtain control as it was national policy. In his witness statement at [18]-[20] Xin said: On 12 April 2005 I attended a meeting in Beijing on behalf of FMG along with (C)MCC, CREC, CHEC and Sinosteel repesentatives. Prior to this meeting, I was unaware that, as a matter of national policy, (C)MCC had been appointed as lead negotiator on behalf of CREC, CHEC and (C)MCC, to negotiate with FMG. Initially, during that meeting, (C)MCC referred to the inadequate resource (which was the subject matter of the Australian Financial Review article) as being the reason by (C)MCC was backing out of the deal with FMG. I recall that (C)MCC also stated that it was physically impossible for FMG to mine 45 million tonnes per annum. There was also discussion about the equity issues, and I recall that (C)MCC stated that their proposal was that there would be a joint venture with (C)MCC taking 80% ownership and FMG 20%. I recall that FMG representatives stated words to the effect that \"majority ownership of FMG or the project was not available\". I then raised and repeated the comments regarding majority control that had been made by Mr He during my conversation with him on 9 April 2005, namely that the comments about the geology of the FMG project were just an excuse which was being used for negotiating purposes. The (C)MCC representatives said to me words to the effect of \"so, you know Mr He, do you? \", to which I responded \"yes\". The (C)MCC representatives did not deny anything I had said about Mr He's comments. Minutes of this meeting were prepared by Sun of CMCC. These minutes were reviewed by Davi Liu and he commented as follows in an email to Xin sent on 18 April 2005: Please find attached the Minutes of Meeting between FMG and (C)MCC in Beijing on April 12, 2005. We have made certain changes to fully reflect what was discussed during the two sessions at (C)MCC. Liu amended the minutes to include the statement: FMG again made it clear that it had never put majority equity up for sale. In an email from Xin to FMG directors and executives including Forrest, Scrimshaw, Watling, Catlow and Riley of 19 July 2005 he pointed out that on 28 June 2005, under instructions from NDRC, CMCC made a proposal for equity which was 60/40, that is 60% to FMG. This was a dramatic shift from their previous position of 20/80. He points out: once the NDRC machine sees our steel resolution not to cave into any pressure/bully/stand over tactics they will come back with more sense. The reason Mr He initiated the approach through CMCC to the Australian Financial Review was, I find, a commercial strategy or tactic to pressure FMG to surrender control of the Project to the Chinese. Whilst FMG did continue to negotiate with the Chinese, it began in parallel to seek to raise the necessary funds elsewhere. I do not regard that as supporting a conclusion that FMG considered that the framework agreements were not binding. FMG had a tight timetable for establishing its Project and moving to the production and export of iron ore. The course it adopted of looking to other financiers for its infrastructure seems to me to have been nothing other than commercially prudent in the face of illegitimate pressure and what was arguably a breach by the Chinese Contractors of their obligations under the framework agreements. When the negotiations with the Chinese came to nothing, FMG sent notices to the Chinese Contractors terminating the framework agreements. Further confirmation of FMG's view that the NDRC and CMCC were negotiating is found in an email from Chris Fraser of Citigroup to Forrest and Huston on 30 March 2005. Fraser said: Andrew/Peter, considering the recent events and your sense that (C)MCC is negotiating, we suggest a polite letter to the NDRC following on from your recent meeting might be a prudent way forward. This will allow you to hopefully attain clarity from the NDRC as to whether the (C)MCC media statements are fully sanctioned. Citigroup suggested a draft form of wording for the letter to the NDRC and recommended attaching a copy of the letter FMG sent to the ASX dated 29 March 2005 which clearly disconnected equity from the terms of the framework agreements. That the conduct of Mr He of the NDRC through CMCC was an attempt to obtain greater equity in FMG is further demonstrated by the fact that, following the publication of the AFR Article, meetings between FMG and CMCC and discussions over equity continued throughout 2005. During this period of time, the NDRC/CMCC position changed from a requirement that CMCC have 80% equity, to one put by Ma of CMCC in June 2005 which I mentioned earlier that FMG have 60% and CMCC 40%; later changed to a position of a 50/50 joint venture which was proposed at a meeting on 7 September 2005 attended by, amongst others, Yang of CMCC and Forrest, at Yang's office. Further, in the minutes of the 7 September 2005 meeting involving FMG and CMCC, David Liu noted, in relation to Yang of CMCC: He insisted repeatedly that the agreements signed between us were in fact binding. In 2006 discussions continued between the parties. As late as 19 April 2006 Wang was speaking on behalf of the CMCC as the leader of the Chinese consortium comprising CMCC, Sinosteel, CREC and CHEC. Those minutes of meeting record Wang stating that: he believed that the three BT contracts were always committed to by all Parties and Fortescue should proceed with the three build and transfer agreements as they would give Fortescue the best chance of completing the project within the current schedule. The minutes record Scrimshaw as reminding Wang that FMG had always said to the NDRC and CMCC that only a minority equity was available. Scrimshaw said that he wanted the CMCC publicly to retract the damaging comments it made to the Australian press in March 2005. He said that that was required for CMCC to continue in discussions. However, Wang said that what had happened between FMG and CMCC was: ...a misunderstanding that we should forget the past that such a letter was not necessary. He also added that we should not involve the press any more and the best way to eliminate the public doubts was to work together. This, I find, was a tacit admission that CMCC had misinformed the Australian Financial Review as to the effect of the framework agreements but that as a matter of public face it could not be seen to categorically withdraw those comments. FMG submits that having regard to ASIC's pleaded case, and the evidence, ASIC's contentions concerning the issues of approvals and equity fail because: (a) ASIC did not plead, nor prove, the relevant legal requirements in China concerning the approvals required for the implementation of the framework agreements. (b) ASIC did not plead or prove that CREC, CHEC or CMCC were required , as a matter of Chinese law, to obtain NDRC approval, either in order to carry out the works for the project or to enter contracts binding them to build, finance and transfer infrastructure. (c) ASIC did not plead or prove that there was a legal impediment upon the Chinese Contractors either entering into or performing the framework agreements. (d) If there was a need for NDRC approval in order to expedite or facilitate their performance of the framework agreements, then that was an \"internal risk\" which the Chinese Contractors took upon themselves. They did not make either the operation of the framework agreements, or their obligations to perform the framework agreements, conditional upon gaining any such approval. FMG was entitled to insist upon performance of the agreements. (e) None of the framework agreements was subject to obtaining approval from a Chinese government agency. (f) None of the framework agreements was conditional on the Chinese entities or anyone else obtaining an equity interest in FMG or the Project. The matters set out under (a)-(f) above are correctly stated at face value. It may be, nonetheless, that in a curial contest as to the terms and enforceability of the framework agreements, the Chinese parties may have asserted, upon the basis of an implied term, that the agreements were conditional on the requirement for equity and NDRC approval. The matter of the need for NDRC approval may have been so obvious as not to have required written expression in the framework agreements. Furthermore, each framework agreement provides that it \"will conform with all relevant Australian and Chinese laws and regulations\". These were not the subject of evidence, or, in respect to Chinese laws, any submissions. Whatever be the case, I do not consider that FMG's submissions, even if correct, necessarily lead to the rejection of ASIC's case in this respect. Even if not contractually expressed or implied, the need for the NDRC approval was, as I have found, a fact of Chinese commercial life for FMG in its attempts to build its infrastructure using the Chinese Contractors. It was a fact which FMG recognised and took steps to meet through its various dealings with the NDRC. The NDRC was not a party to any of the framework agreements yet FMG realised that it had to approve any overseas financial investments by a Chinese company, certainly at the amounts of finance contemplated under the framework agreements. Xin told Mr Forrest as much in April 2004. This covered the financing of the infrastructure projects through the Chinese Contractors. This knowledge was further underpinned by O'Reilly's slide presentation in May 2004; the observation made by David Liu of FMG in the notes of the 17 August 2004 Beijing meeting with Mr He that it was \"a very positive development for the supreme approval authority in China to express support for FMG ...\"; as well as the content of the email from Liu to Forrest of 27 October 2004. I have found that the matter of finance approval was tied by the NDRC to the provision to a Chinese entity of a minority interest in the Project. This was evident at least from 17 August 2004 when Mr He of the NDRC told Forrest that co-operation by the NDRC must allow Chinese investment in at least FMG's mines, not just in the infrastructure but possibly also, in FMG itself, according to Kirchlechner. \"Co-operation\", in this context, I have found to include obtaining the necessary approval from the NDRC for the financial investment by CREC in the rail project. The requirement for agreement on equity, albeit adding that it should be provided to major Chinese steel mills, was reiterated by Mr Bai of CREC a few days later. FMG submits that there was no request for, or even mention of, equity in FMG by CHEC and CMCC during the negotiation and signing of their framework agreements on 1 and 20 October 2004, nor prior to the formal Joint Statement signing ceremony in Beijing on 5 November 2004. It was not a condition of either agreement, despite, in the case of the CMCC framework agreement, the fact that CMCC had earlier been nominated by Mr He of the NDRC as the future equity holder or joint venturer. The CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements were to be in essentially the same form as the CREC Framework Agreement. I accept ASIC's submission that in these circumstances it is not surprising that there is no record of any discussion with CHEC representatives during their visit to Perth about the conditions of Chinese government approval. FMG knew that it was intended that CHEC and CMCC join 'the Chinese alliance'. On 3 October 2004, Forrest emailed Field and various FMG executives saying that FMG appeared to be receiving Chinese Government support as the NDRC have called \"all three (Rail, Metallurgy and Harbours) in and asked them each to become collectively involved in FMG\". David Liu's responsive email of 3 October 2004 said that if CHEC and CMCC come on board, it would be critical for FMG to talk to Mr He of the NDRC and Mr Chen of the MOC straight away \"to commence Chinese banks into action\". Thus FMG acknowledges, it seems to me, that the NDRC approval was essential to the provision of Chinese finance in respect of each of the framework agreements. ASIC submits that, at the time of the release of the 5 November Letter and the 5 November Media Release, concerning the effect of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements and the previous agreement with CREC, FMG was well aware of the unresolved need for NDRC approval and it knew that this approval was contingent on FMG and CMCC reaching agreement on CMCC's equity participation in FMG or the Project. This is not entirely accurate. I find that FMG and Forrest knew that investment by Chinese entities in building the infrastructure required the NDRC approval and that Mr He of the NDRC in turn tied that approval to the requirement that a Chinese entity, likely to be CMCC, obtain a minority equity in, it seems, an FMG mine(s). However, I find that execution of the three framework agreements had been approved by the NDRC and possibly also by the MOC. I accept the evidence of Xin who said that none of the Chinese Contractors would have dared execute any of the framework agreements without that approval and that Mr He told him in April 2005 that CREC, CHEC and CMCC did not themselves have the funds to finance the Project and therefore they required State approval for the agreements to be performed. Mr He knew, as at the 17 August 2004 meeting, that the CREC Framework Agreement had been executed but did not in any way suggest that it did not have NDRC approval to that stage nor did he later seek to do so in relation to the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. I have already concluded that FMG's disclosures were not misleading or deceptive. The additional allegations, concerning NDRC approval and equity do not alter my conclusions. In any event, although I have found that Chinese commercial reality dictated NDRC approval as a prerequisite to the provision of finance this does not mean that the need for approval operated at a contractual level. Neither NDRC approval nor the provisions of equity were conditions of the framework agreements, although they could have been. ASIC's primary claim is that the disclosures made as to the legal effect of the framework agreements were misleading or deceptive. The need for approval tied to equity does not, in my opinion, at least in the way ASIC pleaded its case, impact upon that question. I have already found, in respect of the CREC Framework Agreement, that the evidence demonstrates that the trigger for the NDRC approval, being the provision to a Chinese entity of a minority equity interest, whether by shareholding or joint venture, was almost a formality. FMG had for a long time been pursuing such Chinese involvement, and more, and the Chinese side was anxious to obtain it. The NDRC had given every indication that it fully supported the Project and was keen for Chinese involvement. FMG had, over a long period, made it clear it was prepared to give a Chinese contractor or steel mill a minority equity stake. Mr He, of the NDRC, also made it clear that this was all that was being sought. It was, as at 9 November 2004, when the last two framework agreements had been executed and notifications had been made to the ASX, then only a matter of negotiating the actual amount of the equity interest and its price. There was not even the hint of a suggestion that this could not or would not be achieved. Indeed the position, as at 9 November was quite to the contrary. In other words FMG, quite reasonably, considered that the matter of approval and equity was no barrier to the performance of the framework agreements. ASIC's case concerned statements about the meaning and legal effect of the framework agreements, not that there was a practical barrier to their performance. The market was already aware that significant aspects of the framework agreements still had to be agreed upon through the DFS process and that in any event each of the framework agreements was ultimately dependent on a bankable DFS issuing, at the earliest, in March 2005. Approval by the NDRC, linked as it was to the provision of equity, was merely another contingency. This does not go to the issue of their legal effect, once it is accepted, as I have, that arguably the framework agreements were each binding agreements for the construction of the Project infrastructure. The issue of NDRC approval and equity was regarded, reasonably, by FMG, as a formality. That, from November 2004, this was complicated by the position taken by Mr He of the NDRC merely gave rise to negotiations. FMG was entitled, in my view, to negotiate with the Chinese counterparties through CMCC and the NDRC to resolve the impasse created by Mr He, contrary as it was to the consensus reached in August 2004 for minority equity, without having to inform the ASX, or the market or otherwise. Indeed, as I earlier identified, by September 2005, FMG had succeeded in reducing the demands for majority equity down to a proposed 50/50 joint venture although that process took many months. However the DFS completion date had been extended beyond March 2005 and was only partially completed in September 2005 and not fully completed till April the following year. FMG's knowledge that performance of the framework agreements depended on NDRC approval and that this in turn was tied to the provision of an equity interest to a Chinese entity did not for the reasons I have mentioned render the various announcements and representations made by FMG as to the terms and legal effect of the framework agreements conduct that was misleading or deceptive or likely to be so under s 1041H of the Act. Misleading and deceptive conduct --- additional claims ASIC says that a number of additional statements made by FMG in the 8 November Letter and elsewhere were misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive. These complaints are secondary to the primary complaint that FMG made disclosures that it had entered into binding contracts with the Chinese Contractors to build, finance and transfer the Project infrastructure when the framework agreements did not oblige the Chinese Contractors to do that. A number of these statements are interrelated and need to be read in context of not only the letter but the facts that were then known to the market. I accept FMG's submissions that the disclosures in the 8 November Letter alone would have led a common investor to understand that the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements were first agreements pursuant to a design, build and finance arrangement for the relevant Project infrastructure in which the first part of the work covering design and engineering was yet to be performed. They expressly contemplated that the price for each of the three infrastructure projects would be established through the DFS process and that this, amongst other things such as the engineering and design specifications would be included in due course in formal construction contracts. The 8 November Letter also explained that the three agreements, including the CREC Framework Agreement, were subject to contingencies and conditions and would have been so understood by investors. Sisson, as I said, accepted this to be so. Similarly, Watson agreed that any reasonable investor reading the 5 November Letter, the 5 November Media Release and the 8 November Letter would have understood that the agreements announced were contingent on the completion of a feasibility study which concluded that there was a viable economic project, and upon FMG proving a sufficient quantity of resource of the requisite quality to render the Project economically viable. These contingencies included determination of the price, upon which funding was dependent, proof that there were resources of sufficient size and quality, and completion of a bankable DFS. The common investor would have understood that the three agreements would not go ahead unless the various contingencies and conditions were fulfilled. Against that background I will now consider ASIC's particular complaints. Set Price and DFS ASIC pleads that the following statements were false and were misleading or deceptive, or were likely to mislead or deceive. (a) ASC 86(g): CREC, CHEC and CMCC would be working with FMG and the Worley Group within a \"Definitive Feasibility Study process\" to establish a firm price which would then be incorporated into a fixed price contract with each party. (b) ASC: 86(h): the agreements with CREC, CHEC, and CMCC provided a continuing platform for the advancement of component parts of the Project in parallel to ensure that the \"Definitive Feasibility Study process\" was finalised within the set timeframe. (c) ASC 86(i): \"The agreements with CREC, CHEC and CMCC contemplated the first stage of work covering design and engineering would allow for the confirmation of a mutually agreed set price for embodiment into formal construction contracts. ASIC says that this is so because: (a) CREC, CHEC or CMCC framework agreements did not refer to the DFS and did not oblige CREC, CHEC and CMCC to take any steps in respect of the DFS at all or within a set timeframe and did not contain any mutually agreed set price which could be the subject of any confirmation process and there were no terms and conditions to this effect in the framework agreements and nothing in the framework agreements contemplated the confirmation of a price. (b) There was no provisional or estimated price in the framework agreements that could be the subject of confirmation or firming up. Nor did the framework agreements contain any provisions or agreements by the parties to the effect that whatever price they might agree should be incorporated into a fixed price agreement. The negotiation of price was left at large for further discussions and the parties could have proceeded to agree a price that was subject to variations, rise and fall or other adjustments. (c) In addition, there were no provisions of the framework agreements which required that the Chinese contractors must work with FMG and Worley Group within the DFS process so as to confirm a price. I have already referred to the fact that the market understood that the DFS was expected to define the scope and design of the works and the costs of it and its economic viability. As well as defining the scope of the works, scheduling requirements and various technical aspects, the aim of the DFS was to determine the cost and viability of the Project. With those aspects determined, it would be possible for finance for the Project to be raised. It was accordingly evident to the market that the DFS was the primary mechanism for the setting of the price. Furthermore, the market knew from 9 November 2004 from the terms of FMG's notification to the ASX dated 8 November 2004, that the price was yet to be fixed. The release stated that all three Chinese Contractors would be working with FMG and Worley within the DFS process to establish a firm price which would then be incorporated into a fixed price contract with each party. Accordingly, the market was fully aware that the \"binding contracts\" (CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements) and the \"binding agreement\" (CREC Framework Agreement) referred to in the 5 November Letter when read together with the 8 November Letter were agreements where the price was not yet fixed and that this would be incorporated into a further contract described as a \"fixed price contract\". The market knew that the Project infrastructure cost was but an estimate in the amount of $1.7 billion as at November 2004. That this is how the market would have perceived the relevant content of the 8 November Letter is consistent with the perception of Walsh of the ASX. He contacted Campbell after receiving the 5 November Letter. He asked Campbell to provide the material terms of the agreements and the effect of the agreements on FMG. In seeking additional information from FMG, Walsh, consciously put himself in the shoes of an investor in order to assess whether there was enough information to enable the investor to make an informed decision. A draft notification was provided to Walsh by Campbell and Huston of FMG at a meeting on 8 November 2004. Walsh said that this draft conveyed to him, and he understood, that: (a) the price under the contracts had not been established and it would not be established until the DFS was completed; (b) the parties would be working together through the DFS process to establish a price; (c) price was going to be worked out and embodied later on into formal construction contracts but no formal construction contracts were on foot; (d) FMG was to pay a deposit of 10% and when the 10% was paid, the contractor would issue FMG with a bank guarantee; (e) the balance of the contract price of 90% of the agreed set price would only be due after practical completion and it would be payable within up to three years of practical completion; (f) FMG would have the opportunity to refinance the obligations under longer term arrangements; (g) the security to be given by FMG was a charge or something like a charge over an amount of JORC defined iron ore in-ground; (h) the ability of FMG to give security to the Chinese companies was dependent on proving sufficient amount of resource equivalent to the dollar value of the works under the contract, however the amount of security could not be worked out until the price was determined - an interpretation agreed to by Dr Watson. I do not apprehend that these statements of which ASIC complains, imply that the framework agreements refer to or provide for the DFS in terms or that they provided for the Chinese Contractors to work with FMG and the Worley Group within the DFS process. The time frame referred to was that anticipated for completion of the DFS. They are statements as to what FMG was actually doing through Worley Group, the DFS Manager and the Chinese Contractors toward reaching agreement on the price for the infrastructure projects. The evidence supports this conclusion. In the April 2004 China Trip Report by FMG it was noted that FMG had advised Bai, vice-president of CREC, that if CREC undertook, as it wished to, the detailed engineering on the project through to \"feasibility status\" this would place CREC in a very advantageous position. In a letter dated 17 June 2004 Forrest on behalf of FMG wrote to Bai advising him that CREC would undertake \"Detailed Engineering\" on the FMG railway to become the preferred contractor and that on completion of the \"Definitive and Detailed Engineering Study\" CREC would undertake the Build and Transfer of the rail project with an Australian Joint Venture partner. On 28 July 2004, Zhang of CREC sent an email to David Liu of FMG in which he stated: \"Feasibility report of mine by independent consulting firm. This is very important: it's the project starting point. \" This was a reference to Worley as DFS Manager. On 4 August 2004 FMG gave a presentation to high level representatives of CREC at the FMG office in Perth during which the DFS structure, costs and schedule were discussed in detail with PowerPoint graphics. This disclosed the then present status of the DFS, its management and operational structure across the three infrastructure projects and a proposed schedule for Engineering Studies in relation to these as well as financial modelling, risk assessment and independent review. The capital cost estimates were: Railway - $805m; Port - $470m; Mine - $165m with a Capex Contingency of $216m. It was not only the market that appreciated that, without a bankable DFS, there would be no Project. Mr He of the NDRC, at the 17 August 2004 meeting in China, in effect, understood this. He said to Forrest \"If you don't prove up your mines, the infrastructure is worthless\". On 24 August 2004 David Liu reported to Forrest and other FMG executives on a farewell lunch meeting with CREC that was hosted by Bai of CREC, and stated: \"CREC will send a team of 4-5 designers and engineers to work with Worley before September 6\". ASIC submits that the statement in the 8 November Letter concerning the confirmation of a price would be read and understood by investors and potential investors in the context of FMG's earlier announcements including the 5 November Letter and the statements made about price on 23 August. FMG made a submission to the same effect. ASIC points out that the 5 November Media Release clearly stated that the three agreements limited the total price and financing requirement to less than the estimated $1.85 billion total project cost; and that the 8 November Letter said that the aggregate cost of the assets covered under the respective agreements is 'estimated' at $1.7 billion. ASIC says investors would understand from the context that these statements indicated the limit that had been set on project costs, the financing commitment and the price by the framework agreements. I do not accept this to be so. Reasonably understood, the statements were to the effect that the agreements entered into did not provide for a fixed price. I do not accept ASIC's submission that the statements imply that the framework agreements must have included an estimated or provisional price to be \"confirmed\". The 8 November Letter speaks of not merely the \"confirmation of a mutually agreed set price\" but earlier refers to the contractual parties and Worley working together to \"establish a firm price\". Whether or not there was a provisional or estimated price it was absolutely clear from what FMG disclosed to the market that a contract price had not yet been agreed. I hold the same view of ASIC's argument concerning the differences between the fixed price on the one hand and a price, subject to variations, rise and fall or other adjustments. The statements made about price were highly general, the thrust of which was that the price had not been agreed, but that price would be precisely formulated in due course. It has not been suggested that the $1.7b estimate in the November announcement was not a genuine estimate of the then likely cost of the Project infrastructure. The \"confirmation\" of price is capable of being read as confirming the overall cost of the infrastructure as estimated, albeit not within the four corners of the agreement. I do not think investors would have understood that any limit had been set on costs. The price had been estimated, but the actual price had not yet been agreed. The statements made were not false and were not misleading or deceptive or likely to have been so. I am fortified in this view by the following expert evidence given on these matters by Watson and Sisson. Sisson accepted that the notification in the 8 November Letter made it clear to the reader that the price had not been fixed. He also agreed that, from a commercial point of view, this was a fundamental matter for investors. Furthermore Sisson agreed that: the market understood that funding for the Project was contingent or conditional on the successful completion of a DFS; it was publicly known that the DFS was expected to define the scope and the design of the works and the costs of it and its economic viability; the disclosures of 5 and 8 November would have been read together by the market, and that the market would have understood the disclosures to have said that the framework agreements did not have a price established in them but that the parties would be working through the DFS process to establish the price to be embodied in the agreements; the ability of FMG to give security to the Chinese Contractors for their funding as contemplated by the framework agreements was dependent on proving sufficient amount of resource equivalent in dollar value to the value of the works under the agreements. Watson and Sisson agreed with Walsh's interpretation that the 8 November Letter disclosed that the parties would be working together through the DFS process to establish a price. Sisson agreed that the 8 November Letter would also have indicated to the reader that the design and engineering had not yet been done, and that only when it was done would a mutually agreed set price be agreed and embodied into construction contracts. Watson agreed, reasonably in my opinion, that a reasonable investor would view the agreements as first binding agreements, to be followed by formal detailed contracts that would embody the price. Sisson considered too that the 8 November Letter conveyed that FMG was still to prove up reserves. Watson agreed with Walsh's understanding that FMG's ability to give security depended on it proving up sufficient reserves equal to the dollar value of the work under the agreement and that the amount of the security could not be worked out until the price was determined. Amounts \"under agreement\" ASIC complains at ASC [92] of FMG's statements made in the November Presentation, which was published by the ASX on 25 November 2004, that FMG had funding for the infrastructure components \"under agreement\" with the Chinese Contractors in the sums of: A$306 million from CMCC for the mine ASC [92(h)]; $630 million from CREC for the railway ASC [92(i)]; and $571 million for the shiploading and stockyard infrastructure from CHEC ASC [92(j)]. ASIC says that the framework agreements did not oblige the Chinese Contractors to provide funding in those or any other sums for the respective infrastructure components An examination of the November Presentation shows those amounts were set out in two tables listing forecast sources and uses of FMG funding. One table lists A$410m total funding comprised of A$306m from China Metallurgical (CMCC), described as being \"under agreement\", and $104m from Steel Mills. The second table lists A$1440m in funding sourced from China Rail (CREC), China Harbour (CHEC), Iron Ore Customers and Locomotive leases. The funding from China Rail was stated at $630m and for China Harbour at $571m. This is the source of the three amounts said to be under agreement. The funding from the Iron Ore Customers is stated at $139m and locomotive leases at $100m. The combined total of the funding sources in the two tables is $1.85 billion. In a news release dated 8 July 2004, FMG publicised the appointment of Worley to manage the DFS. The news release opened with the statement: \"The fight to free up greater development of Australia's rich iron ore deposits stepped up today with a key appointment by Fortescue Metals Group Ltd for its $1.85 billion Pilbara Iron Ore and Infrastructure Project. \" The news release went on to state that Project comprised: \"a $450 million mining and processing facility, a new advanced $930 million railway open to all users between the Pilbara and Port Hedland, and the injection of $470 million of new dedicated iron ore loading and berthing facilities at Port Hedland\". Those amounts also total $1.85 billion. FMG referred in a number of disclosures to the sum of \"$1.85 billion\" when introducing the topic of its Pilbara iron ore Project. It is clear that $1.85 billion was FMG's estimate of the cost of the Project. This sum was arrived at by adding the estimated costs of the mine, rail and port infrastructure. In the PFR, the grand total of the 'Capital Cost Estimate Breakdown', including rail, port and mine infrastructure costs, was $1,616.9 million or approximately $1.62 billion. That figure included $212 million in contingencies. A comparison of the breakdown of costs for the mine, rail and port infrastructure in the PFR of June 2004, the FMG news release of 8 July 2004, and the November Presentation shows differences in the estimated capital costs of each component over the three documents, but that does not mean, in my view, that FMG engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by saying it had the amounts \"under agreement\". The estimated cost announced in the November Presentation of $1.85 billion includes the three amounts said to be \"under agreement\". The figures were not plucked out of the air. The PFR is a very detailed report and sets out with some specificity the capital costs estimates for the infrastructure. There was a detailed capital cost breakdown but it was correctly and expressly described as an estimate. It was evident that the total infrastructure cost was not going to be met under the agreements with the Chinese Contractors who were to build the infrastructure --- there were other sources. That the framework agreements do not refer expressly to those amounts, nor to the $1.85 billion total cost, should be viewed in the same way as the absence of the other contractual terms of which ASIC complains. As it was reasonable, in my view, for FMG to hold the view that the framework agreements were binding agreements with further agreements to follow setting out the more particularised terms for the Chinese Contractors to build, finance and transfer the infrastructure, including the capital costs of each component, which were as yet undetermined, there was no misleading or deceptive conduct in FMG making public statements about its own estimates of those capital costs. Those statements consistently represented that the total cost of the Project would be in the range $1.6 billion to $1.85 billion. The market was aware that the actual prices for the framework agreements had yet to be agreed. Deletion of \"binding\" In its closing submissions ASIC points to pages in copies of the November Presentation, the RIU Presentation and the Bag of Rusty Nails Presentation in support of its contention that FMG was aware in February that the framework agreements were not binding. ASIC says the deletion of the word 'binding' from a boxed statement saying \"Contracts Signed & First subcontractors Appointed\" in the RIU Presentation shows a consciousness by FMG and Forrest that it was false and misleading for FMG to make unqualified claims that it had binding BT contracts with the Chinese Contractors. A comparison of the relevant page in the three presentations shows that in the November Presentation the relevant page included the boxed statement \"Binding Contracts Signed & First subcontractors Appointed\", but that the word \"binding\" had been deleted from the corresponding statement in the presentations given in February. On 25 November 2004 Heyting sent by email to Danny Broad of Downer EDI Rail a copy of a presentation he had given to that company on 18 November 2004. In cross-examination, Heyting stated that Downer EDI Rail was one of three companies that manufacture rail components in Australia. The transcript records the following exchange between senior counsel for FMG, Mr Karkar QC and Heyting in cross-examination. Again, I have edited this portion of the transcript by attributing to the text the names of the speaklers for clarity. MR KARKAR: Could I trouble you to go to the page which has 0572 as the last digits? MR HEYTING: Yes. MR KARKAR: You will see there under the heading \"Rail Construction\": 18 months fast track. CREC build transfer and finance binding contract. ? MR HEYTING: Yes. MR KARKAR: You wrote that? MR HEYTING: That is a slide that's come from other presentations. MR KARKAR: Did you write it? MR HEYTING: I've written - I can't remember that specific text, but the majority of this text is extracted or combined from a number of different presentations. MR KARKAR: But you were quite happy to present to Downer EDI this slide? MR HEYTING: Yes. MR KARKAR: Because this slide represented your honest view at the time? MR HEYTING: Yes. As I've indicated, I believe that CREC acted as though they had a contract in place. In my view, the deletion of 'binding' from the box in the presentation demonstrates nothing. As I have already stated, I consider that FMG and Forrest reasonably and honestly considered that FMG had signed binding agreements with the Chinese Contractors. As ASIC says, despite the deletion, FMG continued to make statements to that effect. The word 'binding' may have been deleted from the presentations given in February simply for reasons of style or layout, or because, as Heyting stated in his evidence, he thought the word 'binding' was tautologous when used with the word 'contract'. Whatever the reason for the deletion, I am satisfied that it was not because FMG was of the view in February that the framework agreements were not legally binding. A diversionary tactic In the period leading up to the release of the 5 November Letter, the 5 November Media Release and the 8 November Letter, FMG was considering the release of information to the market concerning a number of matters additional to the fact of the execution of the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. These matters concerned the execution of: 1. MOUs between a state agreement between FMG and the Western Australian Government in relation to land tenure for the proposed railway from the minesite to Port Hedland. a framework agreement between FMG and ThyssenKrupp on 19 October 2004 for the latter to \"supply and/or supply and install equipment related to the port, railway and mines\" for the Project. FMG sought and obtained advice from Field PR in relation to its media strategy for making announcements about the above matters. The emails annexed to the witness statement of Skinner of Field PR demonstrate that he forwarded a draft copy of the 5 November Media Release to FMG on 4 November 2004. These emails also demonstrate that on 4 November Forrest, Campbell and Tapp corresponded with Field and Skinner over the financial details disclosed in the draft media release. Field and Skinner were firmly of the view that the details of costing in the release should include dollar figures, as it would \"lend considerable credence to, and quantif(y), the support of the Chinese\". The value of the Project was stated to be $1.6 billion in the initial draft circulated by Skinner. During these email exchanges, discussion ensued over the content of the release, including the cost of the Project. Field said that Forrest had told him that the cost had come down from $1.85 billion to $1.6 to $1.7 billion. Tapp said that the value of the Project had not changed from $1.85 billion, and expressed the view that the statement that the Project was to be built by three Chinese companies would cause \"all sorts of problems\" unless it was qualified by an explanation that the work would be done through Australian subcontractors. Skinner's response to Tapp, Forrest and other FMG executives included the comment that the release \"...should not be diluted by excessive detail about which Australian companies hope to do what. That can be for another day...\". On Saturday 6 November, Campbell sent an email to Forrest, Field, Skinner and Huston, amongst others, attaching a draft of the 8 November Letter. He said he was assuming that the ASX required more information about the deals signed on Friday, deals which I infer to be the signing of the Joint Statement on 5 November 2004 which rendered the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements binding. He said that in consideration of the ASX requiring more information, he had drafted: a wide ranging announcement covering several topics but leading with the State Agreement which should be the primary focus. Forrest's response to Campbell and others began with the comment: Hi Rod seems a little wordy but no doubt that is intentional. In response to Campbell's email, Skinner reiterated his emphasis on putting dollar amounts in this announcement, and provided several amounts in addition to the total estimated project cost of $1.85 billion, such as what China's 90% contribution would be, for inclusion in the letter. Forrest replied to Skinner in strong terms, telling him: that he did not want to include price figures in the letter because: \"...we don't want a price (unless it is unbelievably low) as we want a feasibility study to give us the argument to make sure we get a fair price. The 3 contracters (sic) (CREC, CHEC and CMCC) have an obligation to give us that. \" to forget putting precise numbers in the letter \"unless Peter (Huston) is forced by an out of touch bureaucrat to illustrativly (sic) show an example of what it might be\". ASIC submits that these emails provide evidence that FMG intended to mislead the ASX. Senior counsel for ASIC stated: Now, what those documents show, your Honour, is this about intention. Campbell and the FMG executives knew that the ASX required more information about the deals signed on Friday but instead responding to that request in terms, a diversionary tactic is used. In consideration of that specific request for information on the deals, Mr Campbell drafts a wide-ranging announcement dealing with other matters; the State agreement and the Thyssen MOUs. The State agreement part of it couldn't proceed because the government didn't finalise its position. A trading halt was requested, or an extension to the trading halt was requested, to permit the 8 November letter to be delivered pending finalisation of the State agreement and that was refused by the ASX. So the references to the State agreement will to come out. That's shown by the whole bundle of emails around this draft 8 November letter and Mr Walsh gave evidence about it: it also shows that Mr Forrest is privy to the strategy, the diversion, and recognises that the wordiness, the emphasis on matters other than those that ASX sought details about was intentional. ASIC did not plead that FMG through Campbell and Forrest devised a diversionary tactic to mislead the ASX through the 8 November Letter. Further, Field and Skinner gave no evidence on that issue beyond the emails that were attached to their statements and were not cross-examined on the content or purpose of their emails. In any event, I find that these emails simply demonstrate a normal commercial deliberative process by FMG in consultation with Field PR over the manner and timing of the disclosure of the three matters that FMG was concerned with at that time as well as dealing with the request from the ASX for more information about the CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements. It was reasonable for Campbell to describe the announcement as wide-ranging given the numerous pieces of information that FMG considered itself obliged to disclose at that time. As for Forrest's comment that the wordiness of Campbell's draft was intentional, it was made against the background of Skinner's advice not to dilute the announcements with excessive detail as well as the perceived obligation on FMG to disclose information regarding the three matters and respond to the ASX's request for extra information. I do not consider Forrest's comment to be illustrative of an intention to mislead or deceive. In relation to Forrest's comment that he did not want to include a price in the letter because the feasibility study was being undertaken to ensure that a fair price was obtained, it is clear that in his view the framework agreements were written to allow a fair and reasonable price to be determined. I accept Forrest's submission that what he wanted to ensure was that a fair price was obtained rather than being committed to a price which was in fact higher than what he could have otherwise achieved by negotiations with the Chinese Contractors on the basis of their costs and the DFS. The 8 November Media Release disclosed that a fixed price arrangement would be entered into once that price was known at the conclusion of the DFS. This did not result in any adverse media commentary. None of ASIC's experts have contended that such a disclosure about there not having yet been a determination of price negatively affected the perceptions of the market. Likewise no media article or ASIC expert asserted that there had been any misunderstanding in the market about the 23 August Media Release. That is, there was no suggestion that this was in any way misleading in that it gave the impression to the market that a price had been determined. There was no criticism that FMG had previously given an impression to the market that price had already been worked out. As I have found, the market knew, as ASIC's experts agree, that the DFS was still being undertaken and that it was this which would determine amongst other things the price and the exact scope of works. I conclude, for the above reasons, that FMG did not contravene s 1041H by making any of the 16 disclosures concerning the CREC, CHEC and CMCC Framework Agreements and the Project generally. PART 10: ASIC'S SECTION 180(1) CASE AGAINST FORREST ASIC pleads at ASC [177] that Forrest contravened s 180 of the Act: (a) on each of the occasions when FMG contravened s 1041H of the Act alternatively s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (16 contraventions); and (b) on each of the occasions when FMG contravened s 674 of the Act (6 contraventions). As ASIC's case is pleaded, any liability of Forrest under s 180 depends upon establishing breaches by FMG of ss 674 and 1041H. I have concluded already that ASIC has not established that FMG has contravened ss 674(2) and 1041H of the Act. Accordingly, for this reason alone, ASIC's case against Forrest fails. It was unnecessary for me to deal with ASIC's alternative case under s 52 of the TPA. Nonetheless, in the event that I am wrong as to the liability of FMG, I intend to deal with Forrest's principal defence on the merits. Section 180(1) of the Act provides that a director or other officer of a corporation must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of a corporation in the corporation's circumstances and occupied the office held by, and had the same responsibilities within the corporation as, the director or officer. ASIC's case is that in causing, authorizing, permitting or not preventing FMG to make the disclosures as pleaded in ASC [164, 165, 166, 168 and 169]. Forrest breached this provision. ASIC submits that the elements found in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199 that led Gzell J to find that Macdonald had breached his duties as a director are present in this case in that Forrest: (a) was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; (b) had control and responsibility for the making of ASX announcements; (c) was intimately involved in the preparation and approval of the various announcements and the later company presentations; (d) knew full well that the statements were false, misleading and deceptive and that unqualified and emphatic statements could not be made concerning the execution of binding, build and transfer contracts by the three Chinese contractors; (e) knew that the ASX announcements and the company presentations had been crafted to induce a positive effect on the price or value of FMG shares by positively influencing investors; (f) knew that this conduct exposed FMG to serious risks to its reputation and placed it in likely contravention of important provisions of the Act; (g) knew that the false announcements withheld from the market the true information concerning the terms, legal effect and significance of the actual framework agreements, which steps placed FMG at risk of likely contravention of s 674. It is not in issue that Forrest was, at all material times prior to about 17 May 2005, the chairman of directors and chief executive officer of the first defendant; and that he has, since on or about 17 May 2005, been FMG's chief executive officer. In his closing written submissions, Forrest points out that ASIC did not tender any direct evidence regarding his, or any other FMG directors' duties or call expert evidence regarding the role of a director or a chief executive officer in a company like FMG at the material times. Forrest also points out that ASIC had sought to tender parts of his s 19 ASIC Act examination transcript but withdrew the tender after he sought to include parts of the explanatory and contextual portions of his examination transcript. Forrest says that, based on the tendered evidence, his role may be described as \"being involved in FMG's management and promotion\". However, given his admissions in his defence concerning his role in FMG, I will deal with the claims against him on the basis of those admissions. He does not dispute that, at all material times, as FMG's chairman of directors and chief executive officer, he owed a duty to FMG to act with due care and diligence. I accept ASIC's submission that a chief executive officer or managing director may reasonably be expected to have more information available to him or her and to be more diligent than other board members. The title, Managing Director, is synonymous with Chief Executive Officer. This matter of principle may be discerned from a number of authorities. A managing director has a particular responsibility to make sure the other directors understand the potential harm in a proposed transaction: Permanent Building Society v Wheeler (1994) 11 WAR 187, at 241. A chief executive officer will be employed under a contract containing an express or implied term that he or she exercise the care and skill expected of a person in that position: AWA Ltd v Daniels t/as Deloitte Haskins & Sells (1992) 7 ACSR 759 at 1014. At p 867 the Court explained that a chairman is: ...responsible to a greater extent than any other director for the performance of the board as a whole and each member of it. The chairman has the primary responsibility of selecting matters and documents to be brought to the board's attention, in formulating the policy of the Board and in promoting the position of the company. Unique amongst other corporate officers, the chief executive officer stands at the apex of the operational and managerial structures of the company, and his or her authority is qualified only by any residual power left in the board: Randall v Aristocrat Leisure Ltd [2004] NSWSC 411. A chairperson of a listed public company may have special responsibilities beyond those of other non-executive directors. These responsibilities include such things as the public announcement of information: ASIC v Rich [2009] NSWSC 1229 at 463. Einstein J in Randall v Aristocrat Leisure [2004] NSWSC 411 said at [383]: Subject always to the terms of appointment, it is evident that the law tends to assume that where the board resolves to appoint a chief executive officer, his or her powers to control the operational and managerial aspects of the company's business will be broad indeed. In the seminal case of Freeman & Lockyer (a firm) v Buckhurst Park Properties (Mangal) Ltd [1964] 2 QB 480 , for example, Lord Diplock held (at 505) that where a board permits a person to \"act in the management or conduct of the company's business\", that delegation of executive authority alone is sufficient to vest that person with ostensible authority to bind the company to transactions usually entered into \"in the course of such business\" by such managers... Moreover, and equally facilitative of the exercise by a chief executive of broad powers of company management, is the replaceable rule in s 198C(1) of the Act, which provides that \"[t]he directors of a company may confer on a managing director any of the powers that the directors can exercise. The breadth of managerial powers delegated to the chief executive officer by the board is ultimately contingent on the terms of appointment of the CEO: Harold Holdsworth & Co (Wakefield) Ltd v Caddies [1955] 1 WLR 352 as cited in Randall v Aristocrat Leisure [2004] NSWSC 411 at [382] . There is no evidence to demonstrate that Forrest's powers and authority as Chief Executive Officer were limited in any relevant way. I find that he was intimately and directly involved in the execution of the framework agreements, the formulation of FMG's notifications to the ASX and other disclosures, as well as the ongoing discussions with the NDRC and CMCC seeking Chinese government approval. Likewise, Forrest was intimately and directly involved in discussions with the NDRC and CMCC concerning the NDRC precondition to approval that FMG must provide one or more nominated Chinese companies with minority equity participation in FMG or the Project. The meaning and effect of s 180(1) was recently analysed by Brereton J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Maxwell (No 2) [2006] NSWSC 1052 ; (2006) 59 ACSR 373 at [99] - [102] and in turn adopted by Gzell J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Macdonald at [236], and by Hamilton J in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sydney Investment House Equities Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1224 ; (2008) 69 ACSR 1 at [27] . Significantly, for this case, a director or other officer may breach his duties by allowing the company to contravene a provision of the Act if that contravention is likely to result in jeopardy to the interests of the company. Brereton J in ASIC v Maxwell (No 2) [2006] NSWSC 1052 ; 59 ACSR 373 said: if a contravention of s 180(1) is to be established, it must be founded on jeopardy to the interests of the corporation, and not to protection of the interests of potential investors: [105] relevant jeopardy to the interests of the company may be found in the actual or potential exposure of the company to civil penalties or other liability under the act, and it may no doubt be a breach of the relevant duty for a director to embark on or authorise a course which attracts the risk of that exposure, at least if the risk is clear and the countervailing potential benefits insignificant: [104] ASIC emphasized the recent judgment in ASIC v Macdonald (No 11) [2009] NSWSC 287 ; 256 ALR 199 , where Gzell J held that the Chief Executive Officer, Macdonald, and a number of other directors, had breached their duties under s 180. Gzell J held that Macdonald failed to advise the board of the company that the draft ASX announcement was expressed in too emphatic terms concerning the sufficiency of funds held by the foundation to meet all legitimate asbestos claims and that as a result the ASX announcement was misleading and deceptive. He also found that Macdonald failed to properly advise the board as to the fact that the cash flow model supporting the statements concerning funding had not verified the key assumptions contained in the model. I have already considered this case, which turns on its own facts. It is of no particular assistance in the resolution of this issue concerning Forrest. Forrest does not dispute that he knew of FMG's duties regarding Listing Rule 3.1 but says FMG did not breach s 674(2) of the Act. Alternatively, Forrest says, if FMG breached s 674(2) of the Act (which is denied), for the reasons regarding Forrest's honest and reasonable beliefs, a reasonable person in Forrest's position and FMG's circumstances would have acted the same way that Forrest did. Further or alternatively, Forrest says that even if (which is denied) FMG breached s 674(2) of the Act, it does not follow at law that he breached s 180(1); and in the circumstances having regard to his honest and reasonable beliefs the Court ought to find that he did not breach s 180(1) of the Act. Forrest then submits that the mere fact that a director participates in conduct that carries with it a foreseeable risk of harm to a company's interest does not necessarily mean that the director failed to exercise a reasonable degree of care and diligence in the discharge of his duty: Vrisakis v Australian Securities Commission (1993) 9 WAR 395 per Ipp J at 449-450; Vines v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2007] NSWCA 75 ; (2007) 62 ACSR 1 per Santow J at [598] and [599]. Conclusion I have already concluded that FMG by its directors including Forrest was not \"aware\" of the legal effect of the framework agreements propounded by ASIC. I have also found that FMG's opinion which underpinned its disclosures as to the legal effect of the framework agreements was reasonably and honestly held by it through its board including Forrest. I consider that Forrest exercised his powers and discharged his duties with the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person would exercise if they were a director or officer of FMG in FMG's circumstances; and if they occupied the offices of Forrest within FMG and had the same responsibilities within FMG as Forrest. Forrest, as I have explained earlier in detail, as a consequence of his own appreciation of the decision in Anaconda; his reliance on the legal oversight and advice of Huston; and his appreciation that the Chinese Contractors held the same view that the framework agreements were legally binding, had reasonable grounds for approving or permitting to be made the disclosures, complained of by ASIC, by FMG between August 2004 and March 2005. I am well satisfied that Forrest acted reasonably to ensure that FMG both complied with s 674 of the Act and did not contravene s 1041H of the Act. He did not breach s 180(1) of the Act as alleged by ASIC or at all. Given the conclusions to which I have come concerning ASIC's case under s 1041H I do not consider it necessary to deal with Forrest's further defence based in s 180(2) concerning the Business judgment rule. PART 11: ORDERS For all these reasons ASIC's Application against each of the defendants should be dismissed. ASIC should pay the costs of each of the defendants. There will be orders accordingly.

Also filed was a supporting affidavit of Scott Robert Coulthart, sworn on 2 September 2009. The affidavit of Mr Coulthartd outlines the documents sought. They are sought from screen-printing customers of the respondent, identified by invoices and packing slips referred to in Item 1 of Schedule 1 of the list of documents filed by the respondent on 13 July 2009. Five classes of documents were sought. On 6 October 2009, when the Notice of Motion was first before the Court, the respondent produced a number of unfiled affidavits which, it was submitted, showed that the One Way Vision product, the subject of these proceedings, was not being used in the way claimed by the applicants. I then suggested that once the applicants had had a chance to read the respondent's material (when produced in proper form), they should advise my associate as to whether the Motion was pressed. On 23 October 2009, the solicitors for the applicants wrote to chambers advising that they did press their application, on the basis of a proposed Amended Notice of Motion, which was annexed to a further affidavit filed by Mr Coulthart on 23 October 2009. In addition to the two affidavits of Mr Coulthart, the applicant filed affidavits of Belinda Nicole Dixon and Jessica Williams on 22 October 2009. By this point the respondent had filed affidavits for eight of its customers. They each said that the customer only uses the One Way Vision product for digital printing and not for screen-printing. The respondent also filed a further affidavit of Jia Ying Wang, the sole director and secretary of the respondent, sworn on 10 October 2009 and filed on 19 October 2009, and an affidavit by Cathryn Weekes sworn on 19 October 2009 and filed on 20 October 2009. Mr Wang swears that it is not company policy to supply the One Way Vision product to customers who propose to screen-print with it, and he says, moreover, that: The Product does not work with screen printing method because screen printing requires a flat printing media [sic] whereas the Product is supplied in roll and does not lay flat after unwound from the roll. I note that there seems to me to be an inconsistency between the claim that the product is not suitable for use as a screen-printing medium and the claim by Mr Wang that it is the company policy not to supply the product to customers who propose to screen-print with it. The affidavit of Ms Weekes swears to conversations she had with customers of the company regarding the use of its product and to certain problems with getting affidavits from some customers, particularly those who were overseas or were in remote locations. The foreshadowed Amended Notice of Motion, which the applicants seek leave to file today, has an amended list of customers which no longer includes those customers of the respondent from whom properly sworn affidavits have been received, but in addition includes a further 19 persons who are customers of the respondent. The submission from the applicants is that the documents discovered by the respondent are an incomplete collection, and further relevant documents are likely to be in the possession of the screen-printing customers. These are the seven customers from the original list for whom affidavits had not been produced by the respondents, and, in addition, 19 new customers that are referred to in the affidavits of Ms Dixon and Ms Williams. The affidavit of Ms Williams in particular is significantly deficient, even for interlocutory purposes. Ms Williams says that she is a personal assistant in the employ of Servcorp, which provides secretarial and personal assistant staff to a number of businesses, including the solicitors for the applicant. At the request of Mr Coulthart, she says she made telephone calls to 140 businesses on a list that Mr Coulthart had provided. Importantly, she says in paragraph 3 of her affidavit: During the said telephone calls, I asked whomever answered the phone whether their business performs screen printing. If the answer was affirmative, I asked whether they would be prepared to screen print onto \"one way vision film\". Of the 140 businesses which she phoned, Ms Williams says there were: 22 who told me (via their employee who answered my call) they were prepared to use screen printing processes on one way vision film, 19 of whom told me they do use screen printing processes on one way vision film. The principal deficiency of this \"survey evidence\", if I could call it that, is that there is no identification of the persons to whom Ms Williams spoke. The evidence, in my opinion, is inadmissible, even on an interlocutory basis, having regard to the provisions of s 75 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth), which provides: In an interlocutory proceeding, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence if the party who adduces it also adduces evidence of its source. The affidavit of Ms Williams indicates that she spoke to \"whomever answered the phone\" without inquiry as to whether the person was an appropriate person to respond to her inquiries. There is no indication of the questions put to those unidentified persons, nor is there any detail of the precise response of that person. There was no effort to identify the respondent's One Way Vision product, but references were made in a generic way to \"One Way Vision film\". Discovery is a process which is within the discretion of the Court. Order 15 r 3 of the Federal Court Rules empowers the Court to order at any time that discovery shall not be required, or shall be limited to such documents or classes of documents, or to such matters in question in a proceeding as may be specified in the order. In determining whether to order discovery, and the scope of the order, the Court will have regard to the issues in the case, the order in which they are likely to be resolved, the likely cost, the possible oppression of discovery, and its likely benefit to the resolution of the proceeding. The scope of discovery is determined by the pleadings. It is the intention of the Court in relation to discovery to confine discovery to those documents or categories which are clearly and directly relevant to issues in dispute. Recent history is replete with instances where the scope of discovery has been totally out of proportion to the value of discovery to the proceedings. The cost of discovery has on occasion been demonstrated to be wholly disproportionate to the matters in dispute. So far as third-party discovery is concerned, it is plain that pursuant to O 15A r 8, discovery against third parties is exceptional, and therefore the power to order third-party discovery has to be exercised with restraint. An order for disclosure of documents by a stranger to proceedings should be made only where the stranger has the only copies of the particular documents disclosure of which is sought, and the party to the proceedings who is seeking disclosure has exhausted his rights with respect to discovery against the other party to the proceedings. It also might be ordered where it has been demonstrated that, exceptionally, discovery orders against a third party are necessary for a just determination of the proceeding. Before an order for discovery can be made, a party seeking the order has to satisfy the Court that the non-party is probably in possession of documents that are relevant and necessary to the determination of the proceedings. The basis of the applicants' third-party discovery application suffers from an hiatus in the reasoning process. The applicants can point to the fact that the parties against whom third-party discovery is pressed are purchasers of the product the subject of these proceedings, and also can point to the fact that those persons engage in screen printing. The difficulty is that the nexus between the purchase of the products and the screen-printing activities of the purchasers of the products is not made out. The evidence from Mr Wang is that the respondent's One Way Vision product, as identified in the immediate Statement of Claim, is not used and is not suitable for use in conjunction with screen printing. That claim, it may be accepted, is contentious and will be pursued at trial, but for interlocutory purposes, Mr Wang says that the respondent's product is unsuitable for use for screen printing, because of its curled form after unpacking from a roll, and the inappropriateness of the ink used for screen-printing on a perforated substrate. There is the logical difficulty in making the inference that the respondent's One Way Vision product is used in conjunction with screen-printing. The evidence shows that those persons who responded by sworn evidence when the application of third-party discovery was canvassed, deny that they screen print using the respondent's product. They have been deleted from those against whom third-party discovery is sought. Those parties have demonstrated that there is no proper basis for seeking third-party discovery. It is not right to require third parties to swear by way of denial that they do not use the product in the way for which the applicants contend. The continuation of the claim for discovery against the remaining persons in the original Notice of Motion, and the attempt for leave to join a further 19 parties, seems to me to be really a fishing expedition, hoping for evidence that might support the applicant's case, but without any probative evidence that it was likely that those parties had documents which were relevant and necessary to the determination of the proceedings. I have been told by Mr Piggott of counsel, for the applicants, that the application for leave to add a further 19 parties was based on answers given over the phone to questions by Ms Williams. The original 15 persons had advertised on the internet that they were engaged in screen-printing activities, and it was that description which led to their selection. The evidence on the Notice of Motion and on the application for leave to file an Amended Notice of Motion, as I have indicated, is inadequate. The evidence of Ms Williams is not admissible for the want of the identification required by s 75 of the Evidence Act . I am of the view that what is required to be demonstrated, before third-party orders by way of discovery should be made, has not been made out. What evidence there is suggests that the \"smoking gun\" documents do not exist. For these reasons, not only should the original Notice of Motion be dismissed, but leave should be refused in respect of the proposed Amended Notice of Motion. For the reasons which I have indicated, had leave been granted, I would not have allowed the Amended Motion because of the deficiencies of the evidence on which it is based. Both the original Notice of Motion and the application for leave to file an Amended Notice of Motion, are dismissed. The parties agree, in the light of what I have decided, that the appropriate order on costs is that there be no order as to costs of the hearing of 6 October 2009, and that otherwise the applicant on the Notice of Motion pay the costs of the Motion, and the costs of the application for leave to file an Amended Notice of Motion. I certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender. Associate: Dated: 2 November 2009 Counsel for the Applicants: Mr D Piggott Solicitor for the Applicants: LegalIT Lawyers Counsel for the Respondent: Mr B Fitzpatrick Solicitor for the Respondent: Victor Tse & Associates Date of Hearing: 26 October 2009 Date of Judgment: 26 October 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1238.html","title":"09_1238.txt","id":"18"},{"snippet":"hello Madhan!!!!","title":"2010.06.01_-_Complaint.txt","id":"19"},{"snippet":"This is an application pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the \"ADJR Act\") for review of a decision of Professional Services Review Committee No 362 (the \"committee\"), constituted pursuant to s 93 of the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) (the \"Act\"). The committee was established in order to investigate a matter referred to it by the Director of Professional Services Review, appointed pursuant to s 83 of the Act. The matter referred for investigation was whether the applicant (a medical practitioner) had engaged in inappropriate practice in providing services specified in the referral. The term \"service\" is defined relevantly to mean: (a) a service for which, at the time it was rendered or initiated, medicare benefit was payable; ... The applicant practices as a general practitioner at Roma. The committee's final report indicates that the referral was made on 17 September 2002. The report was dated 8 January 2009. It concerned the applicant's conduct during the period from 2 January 2001 to and including 23 November 2001. The relevant conduct was that on 66 occasions during that period, he had rendered 80 or more professional attendances per day. Completion of the investigation appears to have been delayed to some extent by the fact that other legal proceedings were in train. Nonetheless it seems unlikely that the purpose of the Act has been served by an investigation completed more than six years after it was commenced. However I am not presently concerned with that aspect of the matter. Section 82 of the Act provides: (1) A practitioner engages in inappropriate practice if the practitioner's conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services is such that a committee could reasonably conclude that: (a) if the practitioner rendered or initiated a service as a general practitioner --- the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners; or (b) ... (c) ... (d) ... (2) A person (including a practitioner) engages in inappropriate practice if the person: (a) knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes, or knowingly, recklessly or negligently permits, a practitioner employed by the person to engage in conduct that constitutes inappropriate practice by the practitioner within the meaning of subsection (1); or (b) is an officer of a body corporate and knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes or knowingly, recklessly or negligently permits, a practitioner employed by the body corporate to engage in conduct that constitutes inappropriate practice by the practitioner within the meaning of subsection (1). (3) A committee must, in determining whether a practitioner's conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services was inappropriate practice, have regard to (as well as to other relevant matters) whether or not the practitioner kept adequate and contemporaneous records of the rendering or initiation of the services. Section 106KA of the Act provides: (1) Subject to subsections (2) and (2A), if, during a particular period (the relevant period ), the circumstances in which some or all of the referred services were rendered or initiated constituted a prescribed pattern of services, the person under review is taken, for the purposes of this part, to have engaged in inappropriate practice in providing those services. (2) If the person under review satisfies the Committee that, on a particular day or particular days during the relevant period, exceptional circumstances existed that affected the rendering or initiating of services provided by the person, the person is not taken by subsection (1) to have engaged in inappropriate practice on that day or those days. (2A) However, subsection (2) does not affect the operation of subsection (1) in respect of the remaining day or days during the relevant period on which the person provided referral services even if the circumstances in which the referred services were provided on that day or those days would not, if considered alone, have constituted a prescribed pattern of service. (3) The regulations may prescribe, in relation to: (a) a particular profession; or (b) an identified group or groups of practitioners in a particular profession; circumstances in which services of a particular kind or description that are rendered or initiated constitute, or do not constitute, a prescribed pattern of services for the purposes of subsection (1). (4) The circumstances that may be prescribed under subsection (3) as circumstances in which services that are rendered or initiated constitute a prescribed pattern of services include, but are not limited to, the rendering or initiation of more than a specified number of services, or more than a specified number of services of a particular kind, on each of more than a specified number of days during the period of the specified duration. (5) The circumstances that constitute exceptional circumstances for the purposes of subsection (2) include, but are not limited to, circumstances that are declared by the regulations to be exceptional circumstances. (6) This section only applies to services rendered or initiated after the commencement of this section. (7) This section does not preclude the committee from making a finding under this Subdivision (other than section 106KB) in relation to the provision of services during a particular period without considering whether or not the circumstances in which the services were rendered or initiated constituted a prescribed pattern of services. Regulation 10 , made pursuant to s 106KA , provides that professional attendances constitute a prescribed pattern of services if 80 or more services are rendered on 20 or more days during a 12 month period. This rule is known as the \"80/20 rule\". Regulation 11 provides: For subsection 106KA(5) of the Act, the following circumstances are declared as constituting exceptional circumstances: (a) an unusual occurrence causing an unusual level of need for professional attendances; (b) an absence of other medical services for patients of the person under review during the relevant period, having regard to: (i) the location of the practice of the person under review; and (ii) characteristics of patients of the person under review. It is common ground that in the relevant period the applicant provided 80 or more professional attendances per day on 65 occasions. The applicant submitted to the committee that there were exceptional circumstances of the kind contemplated by reg 11, and that the committee should therefore be satisfied, for the purposes of subs 106K(2), that he was not to be taken to have engaged in conduct which constituted a prescribed pattern of services for the purposes of subs (1). Subsection (2) provides that it is for the person under review to satisfy the committee of such matters. The committee rejected the applicant's submissions. This is an application to review that decision, the grounds for such review being as follows: the respondents erred in applying regulation 11(b) of the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review[)] Regulations 1999 in that: (a) they did not consider, or they did not properly consider, the location of the practice of [the applicant]; and/or (b) they did not consider, or they did not properly consider, the characteristics of the patients of [the applicant]; the respondents erred in interpreting the phrase, \"the absence of other medical services\" as meaning a total absence of medical services; the respondents erred in concluding that patient preference was not relevant in determining whether exceptional circumstances existed; the respondents erred in that: (a) the respondents concluded that while Roma and its surrounding area is likely to have a higher patient/doctor ratio than many metropolitan regions in Australia, Roma is likely to have been no worse off than any other rural areas; (b) such conclusion was not permitted by the Health Insurance Act 1973 and/or the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review) Regulations 1999 and/or constituted an irrelevant consideration; and (c) there was no evidence before the respondents of the doctor/patient ratios in other rural areas; [and] the respondents erred in concluding that while Roma and its surrounding region had a lower average income, Roma did not suffer a disadvantage. Grounds 1 and 5 were not pursued at the hearing. Roma is a regional centre lying to the west of Brisbane at a distance of about 475 km. The Supreme and District Courts sit there. There is a rail connection to Brisbane and regular air services. There may be no evidence of the above matters, but they comprise common general knowledge and give background to the proceedings. They are not relevant to my decision. The evidence discloses that Roma is the site of regular cattle sales. The applicant has been a general practitioner in Roma for many years. There is, as far as I know, no professional criticism of him or his practice other than in connection with the matter which is the subject of these proceedings. The applicant makes three discrete criticisms of the committee's reasons. They are: that the committee misinterpreted the expression \"the absence of other medical services\" as used in reg 11; that the committee erred in concluding that patient preference (for a particular practitioner) was not relevant in deciding whether exceptional circumstances existed; and that the committee erred in concluding that whilst Roma and its surrounding area is likely to have a higher patient/doctor ratio than many metropolitan regions in Australia, it is likely to have been no worse off than other rural areas, and in treating such matter as relevant to its enquiry. All three matters are said to go to the question of whether there was an absence of other medical services as contemplated in reg 11(b). Meaning of the phrase \"the absence of other medical services\" The applicant submits that a perusal of the whole of the committee's reasons discloses that it interpreted this phrase as meaning a total absence of medical services, rather than medical services which are not readily available, or the level of which was such as to justify the applicant rendering 80 or more services on the days in question. The question is dealt with by the committee at paras 25-57. In particular, the applicant points out that in para 40 the committee observed that it was \"not satisfied that there was an absence of services for [the applicant's] patients, having regard to the location of his practice, on the relevant days\". In para 48 it said that it was \"not satisfied, however, that there was an absence of bulk-billing services for [the applicant's] disadvantaged patients on the relevant days\". In para 52 it said that there was no evidence that any increase in demand for medical services during cattle sales days was such that it could be said that \"there was an absence of services for [the applicant's] patients during those times having regard to the location of his practice\". Finally, in para 56 the committee observed that there was no evidence that increases in demand over long weekends during the referral period or during winter was so large that it could be said that there was \"an absence of services for [the applicant's] patients during those times having regard to the location of his practice\". The committee's language reflects the wording of the regulation. Fairly clearly, reg (b) contemplates an absence of medical services, other than those provided by the practitioner whose conduct is under review, to treat patients of that practitioner. In other words, the question is whether there is some other source of medical services available to them at the relevant time. The applicant's point is a little obscure. It seems to involve the assertion that the committee dismissed the \"defence\" that there was an absence of other medical services, for the purposes of reg 11, simply because there were other medical practitioners in the area. The submission may also contain the further implicit assertion that notwithstanding the fact that there were other medical practitioners, they would not, or could not, have serviced the applicant's patients. As I understand it, the point is distinct from the submission concerning the alleged preference of patients for the applicant's services and the submission concerning the allegedly high patient/doctor ratio. However the three submissions are probably connected. In my view the regulation dictates a practical approach to the availability of other medical services. Within Australia it can hardly be said that anybody has no access to medical services. For a person in Roma there would always be the option of travelling to Brisbane for such services. However such a requirement might not be practicable simply because the requirement for such services might not justify the journey. In other cases that solution would not enable the patient to obtain the required services in a suitable timeframe. In others it would simply involve too much of a disruption to a patient's day-to-day life. On the other hand, it is conceivable that in a small country town having, say, two medical practitioners, both may be so busy that neither is, in a practical sense, able to fit in the other's patients other than by seeing more patients in the same timeframe. The question to be addressed is simply whether or not, if a patient could not have consulted the applicant within an appropriate timeframe, he or she would reasonably have been able to consult another medical practitioner. Such an enquiry involves consideration of the geographical locations of other practitioners, the hours during which they were available and their history of patient numbers. The committee did not dismiss the practitioner's submissions simply because there were other medical practitioners in the area. A considerable amount of time was spent in trying to identify the number of other practitioners and the amount of time spent by them in providing medical services. Reference was had to various prescribed patient/doctor ratios. It is relatively clear that the committee was attempting to identify the capacity of other practitioners to see patients who were, in fact, seen by the applicant. The committee concluded that it was not satisfied that there was an absence of other medical services reasonably available to patients. I see no evidence of any misinterpretation of the kind alleged by the applicant. The committee cannot be criticized for using the words of the regulation. Patient preference This matter is dealt with in paras 58-60 of the committee's report as follows: [The applicant] submits that he has practised in Roma for a period of over 30 years, in circumstances where the town \"has seen many other medical practitioners come and go\". [The applicant] states that his obstetrics practice has \"attracted a following ... in the community from families who wish to continue having him treat themselves as well as their children\". [The applicant] submitted at the hearing on 6 March 2008 that his patients had a right to \"bypass\" a practitioner working in the patient's area, that Australia is \"a country where we've got choice\". Counsel assisting [the applicant] submitted that patient preference could be considered to be a characteristic of the patient for the purposes of regulation 11(b) of the Regulations. It is the view of the committee that patient preference amounts neither to an exceptional circumstance in the ordinary meaning of those words, nor to an unusual occurrence, and is neither a characteristic of a patient nor evidence of an absence of other services for a practitioner's patient. It is not an exceptional circumstance. (Footnotes omitted. ) The applicant submits that any patient has the relevant characteristic of having selected a preferred medical practitioner. At one level this may be correct but at another, it may not be. No doubt some patients seek out a particular practitioner and others do not. A person may go to a medical practice not knowing which of the medical practitioners he or she will see there. Patients may choose a particular practice or a particular practitioner for a wide range of reasons. To treat preference as a characteristic for the purposes of reg 11 would seriously undermine the underlying purpose of the regulation and the Act. Subsection 106KA(4) seems clearly to contemplate the possibility that the regulations would treat as a prescribed pattern of service the provision of more than a specified number of services during a nominated period. Regulation 10 does so. If reg 11 were to be interpreted as exempting a practitioner from the limitations prescribed by reg 10, simply because he or she was in great demand, then the regime established by s 106KA and regs 10 and 11 would be seriously undermined. Every practitioner who services 80 or more patients in a day must do so because the patients have chosen him or her as the practitioner to be consulted. In that sense (and assuming the presence of an alternative) they express a preference for his or her services. The applicant's case goes no further than that, although he sought to identify reasons for his being more popular than his colleagues. I accept that patients may have preferences for doctors having particular qualifications or experience, including non-medical qualifications or experiences and that those preferences may, in some circumstances, be characteristics of the patient. I have in mind a patient who prefers either a male or a female medical practitioner, a patient who prefers a medical practitioner with a particular area of expertise or a practitioner who has a particular non-medical qualification such as a capacity to speak a language other than English. It may, in some circumstances, be difficult to determine whether or not a patient's desire to consult a practitioner having one or other of those qualities can properly be described as a characteristic for the purposes of reg 11. Everybody has preferences in connection with the acquisition of goods or services, but not all such preferences are strongly held, or will be insisted upon or satisfied in every case. For example a woman who would normally prefer to consult a female practitioner would presumably be willing to consult a male practitioner if no female practitioner were available, depending upon the urgency of the situation or her particular convenience at the time. Similarly one can imagine circumstances in which a person who is not fluent in English would nonetheless resort to an English-speaking medical practitioner and try to make him- or herself understood. To my mind reg 11(b)(ii) is not concerned with the preferences of individual patients, but with characteristics of the relevant practitioner's \"patients\". The provision is directed towards a practitioner who attracts patients having particular characteristics, not merely individual preferences. To avail oneself of the benefit of the provision a practitioner would have to show that a group of his or her patients consulted him because they share a particular characteristic. A characteristic is not merely a preference. If a practitioner regularly attracts Chinese-speaking patients, for whatever reason, then that may be a characteristic of his or her patients. If he or she regularly attracts patients whose primary concern is about skin complaints, then that may be a characteristic of his or her practice. If he or she has a substantial proportion of aged patients, that may be a characteristic of his or her patients. The way in which the committee worded its finding in para 60 may be a little loose. It speaks of \"a characteristic of a patient\" whereas as I have indicated, the proper enquiry is as to the characteristics of patients of the practitioner whose conduct is under review. It cannot be intended that entirely idiosyncratic preferences should be treated as such characteristics. Patient/doctor ratio As I have said, the committee considered a quite substantial amount of evidence concerning the patient/doctor ratio in Roma and throughout Australia. At paras 39 and 40 it said: The Committee accepts that Roma and its surrounding area was likely to have had a higher patient-doctor ratio than many metropolitan regions in Australia during the referral period, although the Committee considers that the region is likely to have been no worse off than other rural areas. Having regard to the doctor-patient ratio (however calculated), the number of practitioners who practised in the Roma region on the days on which [the applicant] rendered 80 or more services, and the total number of services rendered on each of those days, the Committee is not satisfied that there was an absence of services for [the applicant's] patients having regard to the location of his practice, on the relevant days. The applicant complains particularly about the words at the end of para 39 \"the region is likely to have been no worse off than other rural areas\". It submits that this constitutes an error: because even if the respondent is correct in its assumption that Roma and its surrounding area is likely to be no worse off than any other rural area, the fact that there are, for example, shortages of doctors in rural areas of Australia generally does not prevent the shortage of doctors in Roma and its surrounding area being a relevant factor in determining whether there is an absence of medical services ... . Alternatively, the applicant submits that reg 11(b) \"does not require that the rural area in which the practitioner was working in the referral period be a rural area that is worse off than other rural areas before it can be found that there 'exceptional' circumstances\". The applicant submits that the shortage of doctors in rural areas is not relevant to his case, and that the committee distracted itself from addressing the correct question by considering that matter. The applicant also submits that there was no evidence of the patient/doctor ratios in other rural areas. The respondent submits that there was, in fact, evidence of the patient/doctor ratio in remote centres. A reference to that evidence appears at para 31 of the final report. I understand the expression \"remote centres\" to be generally used to described towns and cities in rural areas. The applicant submits that the committee should not have had regard to whether the shortage of doctors in Roma and its surrounding area was as acute as the shortage of doctors in rural areas of Australia generally. I accept that this fact would not, itself, necessarily lead to the conclusion that there were no exceptional circumstances for the purposes of reg 11. However it does not follow that the fact was irrelevant to the committee's consideration. It is not surprising that the exercise in which the committee was engaged resulted in reference to patient/doctor ratios. One suspects that the choice of the figure of 80 consultations per day in the regulations was probably based upon some sort of statistical research. However I do not rely upon that speculation for present purposes. The patient/doctor ratios were clearly in evidence and clearly relevant to the task in hand. That task inevitably involved an evaluation of the adequacy or otherwise of the services available from other medical practitioners who were reasonably able to provide such services to the applicant's patients. I see no reason why the committee should not have had regard to such statistics as indicating ratios prevailing throughout the country, using them as an indicator of the level of medical services likely to be available or necessary in the area in question. The committee's approach to the question really depended upon the approaches taken by the parties, particularly the applicant, to that question. The applicant had, himself, asserted that the patient/doctor ratio in the region was higher than the average for both rural and city areas in Australia: see para 29 of the final report. He can hardly complain that the committee chose to deal with that assertion in its reasons. The committee compared the figures in the Roma area to ratios identified as appropriate by Medicare. The applicant seems to have invited comparison with other recommendations more favourable to his case. It was for the committee to use this evidence as it reasonably thought appropriate. There is no reason to believe that it did otherwise. The application must be dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding twenty-eight (28) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Dowsett. Associate: Dated: 23 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr D O'Gorman Solicitor for the Applicant: Avant Law Pty Ltd Counsel for the Respondent: Ms R Henderson Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore Date of Hearing: 14 September 2009 Date of Judgment: 23 December 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1573.html","title":"09_1573.txt","id":"20"},{"snippet":"The applicant taxpayer (Pinot) did not file a tax return for each of the financial years during the period financial year ended 30 June 1997 to financial year ended 30 June 2003. During that period Pinot was the registered proprietor of a number of properties in Mosman Park, a suburb of Perth. Pinot derived rental income from the properties. Following an audit into Pinot's taxation affairs, the respondent (the Commissioner), acting pursuant to s 167 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth), issued to Pinot notices of assessment for each of the taxation years referred to above. Pinot lodged objections to each of the assessments for each of the relevant taxation years. By notices of decision on objection dated 8 February 2007, the Commissioner disallowed Pinot's objections in full. On 5 April 2007, Pinot commenced this proceeding by appealing against each of the notices of decision on objection. Pinot contended that each of the decisions should be varied by \"allowing the Applicant's objection to the extent of excising\" from Pinot's taxable income the amount assessed. During the interlocutory process which ensued, I made an order referring the parties to the proceeding to mediation before a Registrar of this Court. A mediation conference was held before a Registrar of this Court on 23 January 2009. The mediation conference was adjourned to 19 March 2009. On that date the mediation conference was adjourned again and it resumed on 31 March 2009. The mediation did not result in the parties agreeing to settle the proceeding. The proceeding was listed for trial on 30 July 2009. At the commencement of the trial on 30 July 2009, counsel for Pinot advised the Court that Pinot did not intend to advance any case in support of the appeal. However, counsel for Pinot said that Pinot wished to lead evidence in relation to the question of costs. On 30 July 2009, I made orders dismissing the appeal against the objection decisions. I also made directions for the filing of evidence on costs and adjourned the hearing of the question of costs. At the hearing in relation to the question of costs, Pinot contended that I should make orders that the applicant pay the Commissioner's costs up to and including 31 December 2008 to be taxed if not agreed, but that there should be no order for costs incurred after that date. Pinot's contention was that the Commissioner had acted unreasonably after 31 December 2008 by rejecting the offers of compromise which it had made. Pinot referred to three offers of compromise including two which had been made during the course of the mediation conference referred to above. The third was contained in a \"without prejudice\" letter dated 23 July 2009, referred to below. MR ROMANO'S EVIDENCE In support of its contention, Pinot relied upon the affidavit of Mr Daniel Steven Romano sworn 7 August 2009. In paras 15-20 of his affidavit, Mr Romano sets out in detail the terms of the offer that Pinot made during the course of the mediation conference held on 23 January 2009 and on 31 March 2009. The affidavit also describes what occurred at the mediation conference on 19 March 2009. In addition, the affidavit referred to and exhibited the \"without prejudice\" letter on 23 July 2009 written by Wilson & Atkinson, Pinot's solicitors, to the Australian Government Solicitor, the Commission's solicitor, which sets out the details of a proposed compromise. OBJECTION TO MR ROMANO'S EVIDENCE The Commissioner objected to the evidence in paras 15-20 of Mr Romano's affidavit. The Commissioner contended that the evidence was inadmissible because s 53B of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (the Federal Court Act) precluded the admission into evidence of anything said during the course of a mediation conference ordered by the Court. It followed said the Commissioner that paras 15-20 of Mr Romano's affidavit were inadmissible. Section 53A(1) of the Federal Court Act provides: 53A(1) Subject to the Rules of Court, the Court may by order refer the proceedings in the Court, or any part of them or any matter arising out of them, to a mediator or an arbitrator for mediation or arbitration, as the case may be, in accordance with the Rules of Court. Section 53B of the Federal Court Act provides: 53B Evidence of anything said, or of any admission made, at a conference conducted by a mediator in the course of mediating anything referred under s 53A is not admissible: (a) in any court (whether exercising federal jurisdiction or not); or (b) in any proceedings before a person authorised by a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory, or by the consent of the parties, to hear evidence. The Commissioner also relied upon the case of Tony Azzi (Automobiles) Pty Ltd v Volvo Car Australia Pty Ltd [2007] NSWSC 375 ; (2007) 71 NSWLR 140 ( Tony Azzi ). In opposition to the contentions of the Commissioner, Pinot relied upon s 131(2)(h) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Section 131 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides: 131(1) Evidence is not to be adduced of: (a) a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute, or (b) a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute. (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if: ... (h) the communication or document is relevant to determining liability for costs,... Pinot also relied upon the decision of Mansfield J in the case of Silver Fox Co Pty Ltd (as Trustee for the Baker Family Trust) v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 3) (2004) 214 ALR 621 ( Silver Fox ). In Silver Fox , the parties to that proceeding had entered into a mediation agreement. A mediation had been conducted pursuant to that agreement at which offers to compromise the proceeding had been made. The express terms of the mediation agreement imposed confidentiality obligations upon the mediator and upon the parties. One of the terms stated that any settlement proposal made during the course of the mediation would not be tendered as evidence in any proceedings relating to the dispute. The applicants before Mansfield J sought an order for indemnity costs. The applicants argued that in light of offers of compromise which had been made, the justice of the case required that the applicants have their costs on an indemnity basis. In support of this contention, the applicants relied upon two affidavits of their solicitor. One of those affidavits referred to a mediation conducted by the parties and sought to disclose the offers and counteroffers which had been made during the course of the mediation before it broke down. The applicants contended that, notwithstanding the express terms of the mediation agreement, evidence of the proceedings at the mediation, was admissible by s 131(2)(h) of the Evidence Act . Mansfield J accepted that the mediation agreement provided that evidence of the terms of any settlement offers made during the course of the mediation was not to be led. However, Mansfield J observed at 624, at [36]: Section 131(1) , subject to its exceptions, gives effect to the policy of ensuring the course of negotiations --- whether private or by mediation - are not adduced into evidence for the purpose of influencing the outcome on the primary matters in issue. Clearly, it is in the public interest that negotiations to explore resolution of proceedings should not be inhibited by the risk of such negotiations influencing the outcome on those primary issues. It is equally in the public interest that negotiations should be conducted genuinely and realistically. The effect of s 131(2)(h) is to expose that issue to inspection when costs issues only are to be resolved. There is no apparent public interest in permitting a party to avoid such exposure by imposing terms upon the communication, whether by use of the expression \"without prejudice\" or by a mediation agreement. Mansfield J went on to find that s 131(2)(h) of the Evidence Act applied to evidence of the offers and counteroffers made during the course of the mediation conference and he admitted into evidence the affidavits in question. The decision in Silver Fox was considered by Brereton J in Tony Azzi . In Tony Azzi , a party to the proceeding, Volvo, also sought to adduce evidence of offers that were made during the course of a mediation on the question of whether one party should pay costs on an indemnity basis. The mediation in that case had been conducted by the Honourable TR Morling QC pursuant to an order made by Bergin J referring the matter to mediation under the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). Objection was taken to the admission into evidence of offers made during the course of the mediation. Brereton J upheld the objection on the grounds that the admissibility of that evidence was precluded by the terms of s 30(4) of the Civil Procedure Act . Section 30(4) of the Civil Procedure Act relevantly provided: (a) evidence of anything said or of any admission made in a mediation session is not admissible in any proceedings before any court or other body, and (b) a document prepared for the purposes of, or in the course of, or as a result of, a mediation session, or any copy of such a document, is not admissible in evidence in any proceedings before any court or other body. Brereton J distinguished the decision of Silver Fox . At 147, at [23]-[26], his Honour observed: Mr Moses invoked the judgment of Mansfield J in The Silver Fox Co Pty Ltd (as trustee for the Baker Family Trust) v Lenard's Pty Ltd (No 3) (2004) [214] ALR 621, in which his Honour held that, despite considerations of public policy enshrining the need to encourage parties to endeavour to settle disputes without disclosure of communications to that end, and despite the need to preserve the integrity of the parties' mediation agreement which clearly prohibited adducing evidence of the course of the mediation and offers made during it, nonetheless if the terms of those offers were relevant to determining liability for costs, they were admissible pursuant to the Evidence Act , s 131(2)(h) , particularly where the probative value of the content of the negotiations no longer warranted protection. I am inclined respectfully to agree with his Honour that the admissibility of offers is a question of legal principle and not a matter of interparty agreement, and that in the context of a mediation which took place unprotected by any statutory prohibition on admissibility of evidence of its offers made at it are not inadmissible by operation of s 131(1) , because of s 131(2)(h) , although I think it is a mistake to regard such offers as being admissible pursuant to s 131(2)(h): that provision, as I have said, does not make evidence of negotiations admissible, but simply removes one bar to their admissibility, namely that otherwise imposed by s 131(1). Another decision invoked by Volvo is explicable on the same basis: Burgess v Mount Thorley Operations Pty Ltd [2003] NSWIRComm 22 , in which Schmidt J held that an offer made at a conciliation conference under the Industrial Relations Act , s 109, was admissible under s 131(2)(h). Neither in The Silver Fox Co nor in Mount Thorley Operations was there any applicable equivalent of Civil Procedure Act , s 30(4). In those circumstances, it may well be that evidence of offers made at the mediation or conciliation conference can be admitted. But that is not this case, in which s 30(4) applies. The evidence that Volvo seeks to adduce of the offers made at the mediation is evidence of something said in a mediation session. The present costs application is a proceeding before a court. By reason of the Civil Procedure Act , s 30(4)(a) , that evidence is not admissible, and I reject it. (Original emphasis. ) As is evident from the foregoing, Brereton J observed that Silver Fox was decided without reference to the equivalent of s 30(4) of the Civil Procedure Act . In the course of his reasons in Silver Fox , Mansfield J referred to three other cases decided in this Court. These were: Marks v GIO Australia Holdings Limited (No 2) (1996) 66 FCR 128 ; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Australian Safeway Stores Pty Ltd (No 3) (2002) ATPR 41-901 ; and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Black On White [2002] FCA 1605. Each of these cases dealt with \"without prejudice\" communications. None of these cases dealt with the communication of offers of compromise made during the course of a Court ordered mediation. Further, in Silver Fox , Mansfield J did not deal with the mediation conference in that case on the basis that it was a mediation conference to which s 53A and s 53B applied. It followed that there was no consideration of the relationship between s 53B of the Federal Court Act and s 131(2)(h) of the Evidence Act in Silver Fox or in any of the three cases referred to by Mansfield J. The provisions of s 53B of the Federal Court Act and s 30(4)(a) of the Civil Procedure Act are substantially to the same effect. More particularly, both statutes preclude \"anything said\" during the course of a mediation conference from being admissible in a court proceeding. Accordingly, the observations of Brereton J in Tony Azzi are equally applicable to the construction to be afforded to s 53B of the Federal Court Act. In my view, the provisions of s 53B of the Federal Court Act can be reconciled with s 131(2)(h) of the Evidence Act on the basis that s 131(2)(h) applies to \"without prejudice\" communications other than those communications which are made during the course of a mediation conference to which s 53B applies. As I have said, the mediation conference in this case was convened pursuant to an order of this Court. It follows that s 53B of the Federal Court Act applies and anything said during the course of that conference is inadmissible in this proceeding. Accordingly, paras 15-20 of Mr Romano's affidavit are inadmissible. The only evidence as to the making of an offer to compromise by Pinot which is, therefore, admissible is the letter of 23 July 2009, a \"without prejudice\" letter from Pinot's solicitors to the Commissioner's solicitor. This letter contains a proposal in relation to the settlement of three proceedings in this Court to which the Commissioner is a party. These proceedings are this proceeding and two other taxation proceedings to which persons related to Pinot, are parties. The letter proposes that there be a lump sum payment made to the Commissioner in order to settle all three proceedings. The letter also proposes that the payment be made by a bank cheque within \"14 days following the settlement of the sale of [the named property]\". There are also proposals in the settlement letter relating to the means by which the property referred to is to be listed and offered for sale. The letter also refers to serious health issues affecting each of the two related parties and expresses the view that settlement would be consistent with the \"good management rule\" in the Code of Settlement Practice issued by the Commissioner. There is also a reference made to observations by the Full Court in Grofam Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1997) 97 ATC 4656 to the effect that there was much to be said for the Commissioner considering settling taxation proceedings in appropriate cases. There was evidence from Mr Timothy Burrows on behalf of the Commissioner that, consequent upon the dismissal of Pinot's appeal, the total taxation liability of Pinot, including the shortfall penalty, and general interest charge was, at the relevant time, $617,572.27. COSTS The award of costs is in the discretion of the Court. Although the award of costs is in the discretion of the Court, ordinarily costs follow the event, with the consequence that a successful litigant will usually be awarded costs. However, there are circumstances when, in the exercise of the Court's discretion, the Court may not make the usual orders as to costs. In the case of Oshlack v Richmond River Council [1998] HCA 11 ; (1998) 193 CLR 72 at 97, at [69], McHugh J observed: The traditional exceptions to the usual order as to costs focus on the conduct of the successful party which disentitles it to the beneficial exercise of the discretion. In Anglo-Cyprian Trade Agencies Ltd v Paphos Wine Industries Ltd [1951] 1 All ER 873 at 874, Devlin J formulated the relevant principle as follows: No doubt, the ordinary rule is that, where a plaintiff has been successful, he ought not to be deprived of his costs, or, at any rate, made to pay the costs of the other side, unless he has been guilty of some sort of misconduct. \"Misconduct\" in this context means misconduct relating to the litigation ( King & Co v Gillard & Co [1905] 2 Ch 7 ; Donald Campbell & Co Ltd v Pollak [1927] AC 732 at 812), or the circumstances leading up to the litigation ( Bostock v Ramsey Urban District Council [1900] 2 QB 616). Thus, the court may properly depart from the usual order as to costs when the successful party by its lax conduct effectively invites the litigation ( Jones v McKie [1964] 1 WLR 960 ; [1964] 2 All ER 842 ; Bostock [1900] 2 QB 616 at 622, 625, 627); unnecessarily protracts the proceedings ( Forbes v Samuel [1913] 3 KB 706) ; succeeds on a point not argued before a lower court ( Armstrong v Boulton [1990] VR 215 at 223); prosecutes the matter solely for the purpose of increasing the costs recoverable ( Hobbs v Marlowe [1978] AC 16) ; or obtains relief which the unsuccessful party had already offered in settlement of the dispute ( Jenkins v Hope [1896] 1 Ch 278). Pinot contended that the Commissioner acted unreasonably in rejecting its offer and in refusing to make any counteroffer himself. Further, it was said that the Commissioner did not act in accordance with the \"good management rule\" in the Code of Settlement Practice and acted contrary to his obligation to act as a model litigant. In my view, the conduct of the Commissioner cannot be characterised as unreasonable because he declined to settle the proceeding on the basis of the offer contained in the \"without prejudice\" letter of 23 July 2009, and made no counteroffer. I say this for the following reasons. The Commissioner has been wholly successful in the proceeding. This means that the assessments stand and Pinot is consequently liable for the sum referred to by Mr Burrows in his affidavit. It is simply not possible to assess whether the offer made in the 23 July 2009 letter was such that, when compared to the result, the Commissioner's refusal to accept the offer was so unreasonable as to result in him being deprived of costs in the exercise of the Court's discretion. This is because the offer was not an offer confined to settling this proceeding. Rather, it was an offer to settle this proceeding in conjunction with, and as part of, a composite settlement with two other proceedings and the attendant tax liability of Pinot and the two related parties. Although the letter contains some detail of how the settlement consideration is derived, there are only lump sum amounts allocated in respect of costs, interest and penalty. Further, the offer does not provide for the settlement of this proceeding or Pinot's overall tax liability as a separate option. Also, payment of the settlement consideration is contingent upon the sale of a property at an unspecified time in the future. In addition, the Commissioner's position in not making any counteroffer has been vindicated by the result. I also reject Pinot's contention that I should exercise the Court's discretion to withhold costs from the Commissioner on the basis that he has, by his conduct, failed to act in accordance with the \"good management rule\" or as a model litigant. First, in my view, it is doubtful that any such defaults would, in any event, even if established, without more, result in the discretion being exercised to deprive the Commissioner of his costs. Secondly, it cannot be said that in declining to accept the offer of 23 July 2009 the Commissioner failed to act in accordance with the \"good management rule\" or as a model litigant, any more than it could be said that the Commissioner acted unreasonably. Further, although compassionate considerations may from time to time, as a practical matter, weigh with the Commissioner in determining how to deal with the taxation liability of a taxpayer, the question of whether the Commissioner has acted with compassion, is not, without more, a relevant factor in considering whether he has acted unreasonably or failed to act as a model litigant in the conduct and settlement of litigation. Appendix B to the Legal Services Directions 2005 (Cth) which describes the Commonwealth's obligation to act as a model litigant, makes no reference to the Commonwealth having to have regard to compassionate considerations which may affect the other party to the litigation. It follows, that in this case, the costs should follow the event. I will order that Pinot pay the costs of the proceeding (including the costs of this hearing as to costs) to be taxed. I will not order that the costs of this costs hearing be paid on an indemnity basis as the Commissioner sought. Pinot's argument was weak but not so devoid of merit as to justify an order for indemnity costs.

In order to achieve that purpose, Vulcan hopes to complete a Scheme of Arrangement between it and its ordinary share holding members pursuant to the provisions of Pt 5.1 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) ( the Act ). Approval of the Court is sought today under s 411 of the Act to enable that process to occur. The application is supported by affidavits from Mr Hughes who is Vulcan's Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary and Mr Cardaci, Solicitor for Vulcan. The evidence in support of Vulcan's application indicates that Vulcan's Directors and Universal's Directors have agreed upon the merger and have formed the opinion that the most efficient method of securing that outcome is pursuant to the Scheme for which s 411 of the Act approval is sought so as to put the Scheme to shareholders in Vulcan for their consideration. An 'arrangement' under a Scheme is a broad notion. As observed in Re Hostworks Group Ltd (2008) 26 ACLC 137 at [26]; it may extend to any subject matter which is something a company is able to agree with its members, and is likened to a contract between a company and its members. Typically, such a scheme will have some elements that are compulsory for its members, if it is approved. In this case, there are such elements, such as the requirement that all members transfer their shares in exchange for new shares in a new holding company. This will be on a ratio of 1 Vulcan share to 6.85 Universal shares. If the Scheme becomes effective and the merger is achieved, Vulcan will thereby become a 100 per cent subsidiary of Universal. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ) has received the requisite notice and information under s 411(2) of the Act. It has been provided with the Scheme Booklet. The Scheme Booklet contains a proposed Scheme, a final draft Explanatory Statement with annexures. It contains the relevant independent expert's report and the proposed Notice of Meeting and form of proxy. I am satisfied that ASIC has had a reasonable opportunity to examine the materials and ASIC has indicated that it does not oppose the making of the orders which are sought nor does it wish to be heard in relation to the Scheme. I take into account these facts. I am satisfied that the Scheme Booklet which comprises the Explanatory Statement appears to comply with the provisions of the Act in the sense of giving the necessary information such that a member could make an informed decision whether or not to approve the Scheme. Over and above that, it provides additional information consistent with that which would be required under Ch 6 of the Act in the context of a takeover bid. There is an independent expert's report. That report confirms the Scheme is fair and reasonable and that it is in the best interests of Scheme participants. As Mr Hughes deposes, Vulcan and all its option holders as well as Universal have entered into private treaties by which Vulcan and the option holders in Vulcan have agreed to the cancellation of their options in consideration for Universal issuing fully paid ordinary shares in Universal to each option holder. The completion of that transaction will occur if the Scheme becomes effective. It is also confirmed that if orders are made today that a meeting of creditors will be held to approve the Scheme, the Scheme Booklet will be registered with ASIC and sent together with the Notice of Meeting and form of proxy to all Vulcan members. There is nothing in the Constitution of Vulcan which is apparently inconsistent with or contrary to the terms of the Scheme. There is no reason to think that the Scheme has been proposed by either Vulcan or Universal for the purpose of enabling those companies to void the operation of Ch 6 of the Act. There are a number of other aspects concerning the Scheme to which the Court's attention has appropriately been drawn. For present purposes, there is no reason to believe that any of them raise a difficulty, nor does it appear that ASIC is of that view. They include the mechanics of the mutual obligations. The warranty of unencumbered title is high-lighted. The reciprocal 'break-fees' in the merger implementation agreement arise from normal commercial merger negotiations. They are apparently within the reasonable bounds of the Takeover's Panel Guidance Note 7, (that is, not more than one per cent of equity value). The parties have each been separately advised and represented. The 'no-shop' constraints in the merger implementation agreement are subject to an exception for performance of fiduciary duties. CONCLUSION In the circumstances, this ex parte application being a first stage of the process, I am satisfied that the proposed Scheme, if it achieves the statutory majority at the members' meeting is one which the Court would be likely to finally approve on an unopposed hearing. Accordingly, I will make the orders as sought in the minute as follows: Pursuant to section 411(1) of the Corporations Act 2001 (\"Act\"), the Plaintiff convene a meeting of its Shareholders (\"Scheme Meeting\") at King Street Room, Rydges Perth, Corner King & Hay Streets, Perth, Western Australia at 10.00 am (WST) on Friday 29 January 2010 for the purpose of considering and if thought fit approving, with or without modification, the Scheme, a copy of which is attached as Annexure 2 to the final draft document entitled \"Scheme Booklet\" (Vulcan Resources Limited ACN 100 072 624) (\"Scheme Booklet\") which is annexed as annexure \"EEH6\" to the affidavit of Eric Edwards Hughes sworn 10 December 2009 in support of the Originating Process; Pursuant to section 1319 of the Act, the Scheme Meeting be convened, held and conducted in accordance with the provisions of: (a) Part 2G.2 of the Act that apply to the members of a company and have not been displaced or modified by the Plaintiff's Constitution; and (b) the Plaintiff's Constitution that are not inconsistent with that Part and that apply to a meeting of members, save that all voting at the Scheme Meeting be by poll demanded by the Chairman; Pursuant to section 1319 of the Act and for the purposes of Corporations Regulation 7.11.37(3)(b), the specified time for identification of securities holdings for the Scheme Meeting, shall be 5.00 pm (WST) on Wednesday, 27 January 2010, with power to the Chairman of the Scheme Meeting in his absolute discretion to allow late proxies up to the commencement of the meeting; Plaintiff be exempted from compliance with the requirements of Rule 2.15 of the Federal Court (Corporations) Rules 2000 (\"Rules\"), save in so far as that Rule applies reg. 5.6.13 (without the Form 530 stipulated therein) of the Corporations Regulations to the Scheme Meeting; Mr Michael Blakiston, or failing him, Dr Alistair Cowden shall act as Chairman of the Meeting and report the results of the Scheme Meeting to this Court; The Chairman appointed for the Scheme Meeting has the exclusive power to adjourn the meeting or not in his absolute discretion; The proposed Scheme Booklet comprising the Explanatory Statement and its annexures which is annexure \"EEH6\" to the affidavit of Eric Edward Hughes sworn on 10 December 2009, which Scheme Booklet comprises the Explanatory Statement as required by section 412(1)(a) of the Act, be and is hereby approved for dispatch (subject to any minor amendments required or approved by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (\"ASIC\") for purposes of registration thereof under section 412(6) of the Act); No later than 31 December 2009, the Plaintiff (subject to the registration of the Explanatory Statement by ASIC pursuant to section 412(6) of the Act dispatch the following documents, namely: (a) The Scheme Booklet comprising the Explanatory Statement; and (b) The Notice of the Court ordered Scheme Meeting and Proxy Form, which are the annexures \" EEH6 \", \" EEH8 \" and \" EEH9 \" to the affidavit of Eric Edward Hughes sworn on 10 December 2009 to all the Shareholders of the Plaintiff by ordinary pre-paid post (or, in the case of overseas members, by airmail) at their addresses appearing on the Plaintiff's register of members on the closest practicable business day before the dispatch of documents; Leave be given to the Plaintiff to make application for orders under sections 411(4) and 411(6) of the Act following the Scheme Meeting for approval of the Scheme to be heard at 11.30 am on Thursday 4 February 2010 or such other date as the Court sees fit to set for such purpose; The Plaintiff publish notice of the hearing of that application in the form or to the effect of the advertisement in the Schedule hereto once in the West Australian newspaper at least 5 days before the date fixed for the hearing of the application; There be liberty to apply upon the giving of 18 hours notice to ASIC; An office copy of this order shall be lodged with ASIC as soon as practicable after these orders are made.

A delegate (the \"delegate\") of the Native Title Registrar (the \"NT registrar\") declined to register an application for a native title determination filed in this Court on 21 April 2006. The applicant applied pursuant to s 190D(2) for review of that decision. I concluded that the application did not satisfy the requirements of s 190B(5) , (6) and (7) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (the \"Act\"). The Full Court set aside my decision and remitted the matter for further consideration. It did not consider the correctness of my conclusions. Their Honours rather suggested (at [93]) that in my earlier reasons I may have approached the matter on the basis that the adequacy of the factual material should be evaluated as if it were evidence furnished in support of a claim. The Full Court also considered (at [96]) that I had not given appropriate weight to a report by Mr Hagen, an anthropologist. Although I have indicated that these reasons should be read in the light of my own earlier reasons and those of the Full Court, I appreciate the need to approach the matter with an open mind, untrammelled by my previous views. Nonetheless I believe that it is possible to do so and also avoid the considerable time which would necessarily be involved in writing \"free-standing\" reasons. The case primarily addresses the extent to which the application meets the criteria prescribed in subss 190B(5), (6) and (7) of the Act. The Full Court held that the requirements of s 190B were to be understood by reference to the nature of the information required by s 62 to be included in an application. Their Honours observed (at [91]) that: In substance, s 62(1) requires that the accompanying affidavit must contain evidence that the applicant believes that claimed rights have not been extinguished, believes none of the claimed area is covered by an entry in the Register, believes all the statements made in the application are true and that the applicant is authorised to make the application. The application must contain the details specified in s 62(2) and may contain details of the matters referred to in s 62(1)(c). There is an obvious link between the requirement that the evidence of the applicant include a statement that the applicant believes that all the statements in the application are true and the requirement that the application contains the details specified in s 62(2) together with the identification of the details in that subsection. At [92] their Honours continued: Of central importance in this appeal are the details specified by s 62(2)(e) , namely details which constitute a general description of the factual basis on which it is asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed existed and, in particular, the matters referred to in ss 62(2)(e)(i) , (ii) and (iii). Those details are in aid of the description, with some particularity, required by s 62(2)(d) of the asserted native title rights and interests. The fact that the detail specified by s 62(2)(e) is described as \"a general description of the factual basis\" is an important indicator of the nature and quality of the information required by s 62. In other words, it is only necessary for an applicant to give a general description of the factual basis of the claim and to provide evidence in the affidavit that the applicant believes the statements in that general description are true. Of course the general description must be in sufficient detail to enable a genuine assessment of the application by the registrar under s 190A and related sections, and be something more than assertions at a high level of generality. But what the applicant is not required to do is to provide anything more than a general description of the factual basis on which the application is based. In particular, the applicant is not required to provide evidence of the type which, if furnished in subsequent proceedings, would be required to prove all matters needed to make out the claim. The applicant is not required to provide evidence that proves directly or by inference the facts necessary to establish the claim. The proper construction of s 62 may involve an enquiry as to the purpose of such an application as contemplated by the Act. Similarly, the construction of ss 190A , 190B and 190C , which regulate the registration of claims made by application, may involve consideration of the purpose of registration. Registration is provided for in ss 185 - 190 of the Act. It may, in particular, be necessary to consider the meaning of terms such as \"native title rights and interests\", \"traditional laws\", \"traditional customs\", \"factual basis\", \"asserted\" and \"assertions\". THE APPLICATION The Act prescribes a judicial procedure for determining whether an identified claim group holds native title rights and interests. Jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court to make determinations as to the existence of native title. Section 60A regulates the making of applications to this Court for such determinations and other applications. Division 1 of Pt III sets out the process by which the jurisdiction of the Court is to be engaged for the purpose of deciding whether or not there should be a determination as to the existence of native title. Section 62 provides : (1) A claimant application ...: ... (b) must contain the details specified in subsection (2); ... ... (2) For the purpose of paragraph (1)(b), the details required are as follows: ... (d) a description of native rights and interests claimed in relation to particular land or waters (including activities in exercise of those rights and interests), but not merely consisting of a statement to the effect that the native title rights and interests are all native title rights and interests that may exist, or that have not been extinguished, at law; (e) a general description of the factual basis on which it is asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist and in particular that: (i) the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; and (ii) there exists traditional laws and customs that give rise to the claimed native title; and (iii) the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs; (f) if the native title claim group currently carry on any activities in relation to the land or waters --- details of those activities ... . Pursuant to s 63 of the Act the Registrar of this Court must, as soon as practicable after the filing of an application, give to the NT registrar copies of it, any supporting affidavits and other prescribed documents. Pursuant to s 66, the NT registrar is to notify various persons of the application. He or she must give notice \"containing details of the application\" to identified persons and must also \"notify the public in the determined way\". The expression \"notify the public in the determined way\" is defined in s 252. In general, applications are notified by advertisement of some sort. Fairly clearly, the purpose of notification is to notify those persons identified in s 66(3), including members of the public, of the application, presumably so that such persons can decide whether or not their interests may be affected by any determination ultimately made in the proceedings, and whether they should become involved in the proceedings in order to protect such interests. It follows that one purpose served by the application is to assist such persons to decide whether or not to be joined as respondents. It does not necessarily follow that the application must contain all of the information necessary for such an informed decision, but it must provide sufficient information to enable the notified persons, including members of the public, to determine whether or not they should enquire further. Section 62(2)(d) requires that an application identify the particular rights and interests claimed, suggesting that some degree of specificity is required. It expressly forbids a general claim for unspecified native title rights and interests. Section 62(2)(e) is of particular importance in this case. It requires that the application contain a general description of the factual basis on which it is asserted that the claimed native title rights and interests exist, including, in particular, the matters identified in the three subparagraphs. The provision clearly distinguishes between the \"claim\" and the \"factual basis\" of that claim. REGISTRATION Section 190A requires the NT registrar to consider the \"claim made in the application\" to determine whether to accept it for registration. In particular, pursuant to s 190A(6), the NT registrar must consider whether or not the claim satisfies all of the conditions prescribed in ss 190B and 190C. I note that the duty imposed by s 190A(1) is to consider \"the claim made in the application\" and not merely the application itself. Registration performs at least two functions. First, it provides a public record of existing applications: see ss 185-187 and s 190 of the Act. Secondly, registration of a claim confers upon the applicant a right to negotiate pursuant to Subdiv P of Div 3 of Pt II of the Act. It is generally considered that such a right is a significant benefit. Registration also has effects pursuant to some state and/or territory legislation, but those matters are not relevant for present purposes. As the NT registrar points out in his submissions, the Explanatory Memorandum to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (Cth) identified the purpose of the process prescribed in s 190A as: [T]o ensure that only claims which have merit are registered on the Register of Native Title Claims. The applicant in relation to a registered native title claim is also the registered native title claimant [defined in s.253], and may access a number of special statutory benefits which are not available to unregistered claimants. For example, a registered native title claimant may be a negotiation party in relation to future acts covered by the right to negotiate ...a registered claim is able to prevent section 24FA protection from applying to an area ... and certain procedural rights are available only in relation to a registered native title claim. (Original emphasis. ) As the NT registrar also points out, in Strickland (on behalf of the Maduwongga People) v Native Title Registrar (1999) 168 ALR 242 at [9] French J observed: (R)egistration of a native title claim confers upon the registered applicants important procedural rights. It constrains the ability of the State government to proceed to do a valid future act until, in the case of those acts to which Subdiv P applies, it has negotiated an agreement with the applicants or secured an arbitral determination that the act may be done. The NT registrar refers to the following additional passage in the aforementioned Explanatory Memorandum. It explains the deficiency in the prior legislation which was to be remedied by inclusion of the so-called \"registration test\" prescribed in s 190A. It states: 3.31 The purpose of the acceptance test contained in current sections 62 and 63 of the NTA was to screen applications so that those with no prospects of success could be removed early in the process. It was intended that only those claims which were accepted would be entered on the Register of Native Title Claims, thereby enabling the claimants to have access to the right to negotiate and other statutory benefits flowing from that status as a registered native title claimant. Essentially, the acceptance test would ensure development was not impeded by unmeritorious claims. 3.32 The efficacy of the acceptance test as a screening process for registration was reduced by the decision of Justice O'Loughlin of the Federal Court in Northern Territory v Lane (1995) 138 ALR 544 , to the effect that applications are to be registered upon receipt by the Registrar, who is then to apply the acceptance test in sections 62 and 63. This decision meant that all claims, regardless of their prospects of ultimate success, would initially attract the right to negotiate until such time as they underwent the acceptance test. That test could take some months to apply in any given case, so that a claim which ultimately failed the test could remain on the Register for some time before being removed. Finally, the NT registrar refers to the following passage from Commonwealth of Australia v Clifton (2007) 164 FCR 355 at [50]: The Attorney-General stated in the second reading speech [to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 (No. 2)] that one of the outcomes the Bill was designed to achieve was 'to put in place a registration test for claims which ensures that those negotiating with developers have a credible claim'. The Attorney-General also stressed that 'an effective registration test as the gateway to the statutory benefits which the act provides is essential' and that it was 'essential to the continuing acceptance of the right to negotiate process that only those with a credible native title claim should participate'. The requirements of s 62 inform the process to be followed by the NT registrar in performing the function prescribed by s 190A. The available material must constitute a factual basis, in general terms, for the claim that native title rights and interests exist. We are presently concerned with s 190B and in particular subss 190B(5), (6) and (7). However subs 190B(4) is also relevant. Those subsections are as follows: (4) The Registrar must be satisfied that the description contained in the application as required by paragraph 62(2)(d) is sufficient to allow the native title rights and interests claimed to be readily identified. (5) The Registrar must be satisfied that the factual basis on which it asserted that the native title rights and interests claimed exist is sufficient to support the assertion. In particular, the factual basis must support the following assertions: (a) that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; and (b) that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by, and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests; and (c) that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs. (6) The Registrar must consider that, prima facie, at least some of the native title rights and interests claimed in the application can be established. (7) The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group: (a) currently has or previously had a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters covered by the application; or (b) previously had and would reasonably have been expected currently to have a traditional physical connection with any part of the land or waters but for things done (other than the creation of an interest in relation to land or waters) by: (i) the Crown in any capacity; or (ii) a statutory authority of the Crown in any capacity; or (iii) any holder of a lease over any of the land or waters, or any person acting on behalf of such a holder of a lease. Of these provisions, the most important for present purposes is s 190B(5). TRADITIONAL LAWS AND CUSTOMS The reference in both s 62 and s 190B to \"traditional laws\" and \"traditional customs\" is of particular importance. Section 223(1) of the Act provides: The expression native title or native title rights and interests means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where: (a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and (b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and (c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia. Native title rights and interests claimed under the Act must be \"possessed under\" traditional laws and customs. The requirement that laws and customs be \"traditional\" is of considerable significance. In my earlier reasons at [26], I identified a number of propositions which emerge from the reasons of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Members of the Yorta Yorta Aboriginal Community v Victoria (2002) 214 CLR 422 (\" Yorta Yorta \"). Some of those propositions expressly address the meaning of the term \"traditional\" in this context. Their Honours primarily dealt with the subject under the heading \"The Inextricable Link Between a Society and its Laws and Customs\". As to the word \"traditional\", at [45]-[47] their Honours observed: ... Hitherto it has been accepted, and the contrary was not contended in this appeal, that the native title rights and interests to which the Native Title Act refers are rights and interests finding their origin in pre-sovereignty law and custom, not rights or interests which are a creature of that Act. That being so, the references in pars (a) and (b) of the definition of native title to \"traditional\" law or custom must be understood in the light of the considerations that have been mentioned. As the claimants submitted, \"traditional\" is a word apt to refer to a means of transmission of law or custom. A traditional law or custom is one which has been passed from generation to generation of a society, usually by word of mouth and common practice. But in the context of the Native Title Act , \"traditional\" carries with it two other elements in its meaning. First, it conveys an understanding of the age of the traditions: the origins of the content of the law or custom concerned are to be found in the normative rules of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander societies that existed before the assertion of sovereignty by the British Crown. It is only those normative rules that are \"traditional\" laws and customs. Secondly, and no less importantly, the reference to rights or interests in land or waters being possessed under traditional laws acknowledged and traditional customs observed by the peoples concerned, requires that the normative system under which the rights and interests are possessed (the traditional laws and customs) is a system that has had a continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty. If that normative system has not existed throughout that period, the rights and interests which owed their existence to that system will have ceased to exist. And any later attempt to revive adherence to the tenets of that former system cannot and will not reconstitute the traditional laws and customs out of which rights and interests must spring if they are to fall within the definition of native title. At [50] their Honours continued: To speak of rights and interested possessed under an identified body of laws and customs is, therefore, to speak of rights and interests that are the creatures of the laws and customs of a particular society that exists as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs. And if the society out of which the body of laws and customs arises ceases to exist as a group which acknowledges and observes those laws and customs, those laws and customs cease to have continued existence and vitality. Their content may be known but if there is no society which acknowledges and observes them, it ceases to be useful, even meaningful, to speak of them as a body of laws and customs acknowledged and observed, or productive of existing rights or interests, whether in relation to land or waters or otherwise. At [186] Callinan J said: It seems to me that the critical elements of traditional laws and customs and \"rights and interests\" in the sense and context in which the words are used in s 223 are these. The rights and interests must be definable with sufficient certainty to enable them to be enforced by the common law ... . They must, for the same reason, be held in relation to defined land. For their enjoyment a physical presence is essential. This is so, because, if physical presence were not a necessary component of the right or interest, then the right or interest could be enjoyed elsewhere: physical occupation, presence or possession of the land would not then be essential for the observance, participation in, or enjoyment of the right in question. The Act is concerned with title, that is title to land, and a bundle of rights and interests attaching to, or arising out of that title. The definition of the rights must be found in the traditional laws or customs. Tradition requires a high degree of continuity. It also involves intergenerational transmission, acknowledgement and observance. The traditional laws and customs to which the rights and interests owe their existence must be ones which were in existence on first non-indigenous settlement, in 1788, because it was at that time that the sovereign radical title was assumed, and upon which the native title became a burden. And it is those traditional laws and customs which must have continued (albeit that they may have evolved, a matter which I will discuss later) in order to give real content to the rights and interests currently asserted. It follows that in order for native title to survive (absent extinguishment), and be the subject of a determination under the Act, there must have been, in 1788, a recognisable group exercising identifiable relevant traditional laws and customs, themselves reasonably certain, on and relating to defined land, involving physical presence on it, and continuity of these, until, and at the time of the determination. I understand these paragraphs to establish that in order to demonstrate traditional laws and customs for the purposes of the definition of the terms \"native title\" or \"native title rights and interests\", one must demonstrate: The applicant's case necessarily involves the assertion that: Section 62(2)(e) requires a general description of the factual basis upon which the applicant claims to satisfy these requirements. Section 190B(5) requires that the NT registrar be satisfied that such factual basis is sufficient to do so. A PRE-SOVEREIGNTY SOCIETY HAVING RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN CONNECTION WITH LAND AND WATERS Paragraphs 38, 39 and 40 of the applicant's amended submissions are as follows: It is submitted that it is not necessary to start by looking for something that one might regard as a pre-sovereignty \"society\". Rather, it is permissible to look for (factual assertions of) laws and customs, for example like those apparent from the long list which were set out by the Court at first instance in paragraph [70] to [77] of the Reasons for Judgment, and consider whether they can be laws and customs having a normative content which can definite a relevant \"society\". Where the evidence is that such laws and customs have been handed down from generation to generation, inferences can be drawn to the effect that they form part of a normative system at the time of sovereignty. Such an approach was referred to in [ Moses v State of Western Australia (2007) 160 FCR 148) (\" Moses \")] under the heading \"Reasoning Backwards\". Further, there is no requirement that different families maintain contact with each other in order to be subject of a common body of laws and customs. Annexure C includes references to the material concerning the laws and customs which have been handed down from generation to generation, and which can be inferred to be \"traditional\" in the Yorta Yorta sense. See too Annexure E. (Footnotes omitted. ) For present purposes, I understand the date of assertion of British sovereignty to be 1788. However first European contact in the claim area seems to have occurred at some time between 1850 and 1860. I understand the applicant to invite an inference that circumstances as at the time of first European contact were probably the same as the circumstances in 1788. I proceed on that basis. I understand the applicant to submit that one may look at existing laws and customs, presumably those recognized and observed by the claim group, and then draw an inference as to the existence of a pre-sovereignty \"normative system\". I am not sure how one would decide whether laws and customs have a \"normative content which can define a relevant 'society' \". I do not understand the Act to address the appropriateness or adequacy of any system of laws and customs for that purpose. The relevant enquiry is as to laws and customs acknowledged and observed by an existing claim group, laws and customs acknowledged and observed by a pre-sovereignty society and the connection between those societies and between the laws and customs, attributable to them. As is pointed out in Yorta Yorta , a society and its laws and customs are inextricably linked. The applicant then submits that where the evidence is that such laws and customs have been handed down from generation to generation, it may be inferred that they formed part of a normative system at the time of sovereignty. Thus, it is submitted that the application need only contain a general description of the laws and customs presently acknowledged and observed and of the process by which they have been handed down. However the adequacy of such an approach will depend upon the circumstances of the case in question. Of course, in describing the factual basis of a claim for rights and interests in land and waters, the applicant must take account of the specificity required by s 62(2)(d). The general description required by s 62(2)(e) must be, one would expect, commensurate with the detail required by the former provision. In assessing the adequacy of a general description of the factual basis of the claim, one must be careful not to treat, as a description of that factual basis, a statement which is really only an alternative way of expressing the claim or some part thereof. In my view it would not be sufficient for an applicant to assert that the claim group's relevant laws and customs are traditional because they are derived from the laws and customs of a pre-sovereignty society, from which the claim group also claims to be descended, without any factual details concerning the pre-sovereignty society and its laws and customs relating to land and waters. Such an assertion would merely restate the claim. There must be at least an outline of the facts of the case. In some cases it will be possible to identify a group's continuous post-sovereignty history in such detail that one can infer that it must have existed at sovereignty simply because it clearly existed shortly thereafter and has continued since. It would similarly be possible, in those circumstances, to infer that the assertion of sovereignty had not significantly affected its laws and customs, so that the laws and customs shortly after sovereignty were probably much the same as the pre-sovereignty laws and customs. That is merely another example of the process of reasoning which leads to the proposition that the circumstances prevailing as at first European contact were probably the same as those prevailing in 1788. There are cases in which the continuous history of the claim group since the assertion of British sovereignty is well-known, particularly in the Torres Strait where the date of sovereignty is more recent than 1788. Where an applicant seeks to rely on such a continuous history, a general description of the factual basis of the claim will necessarily involve a general description of that history. In many cases the history of a claim group will not be sufficiently well known to permit such an approach. However other matters may be known which assist in demonstrating the traditional nature of the claim group's laws and customs. Sufficient may be known of circumstances before, or shortly after, first European contact (assuming that event occurred after the date of assertion of British sovereignty) to permit an inference that the claim group is a modern manifestation of a pre-sovereignty society, and that its laws and customs have been derived from that earlier society. Such an inference may be available notwithstanding the absence of any recorded history of the society and the way in which it has continued since the earlier \"snapshot\" of the society. Such a case will involve, at some point, a comparison of the earlier and later societies and their laws and customs. A case of that kind may have to address the fact that there is little or no evidence of continuity of the society since first European contact or of continuous acknowledgement and observance of its laws and customs, a problem recognized in Yorta Yorta . From a forensic point of view the difference between these two approaches is that in the former, the necessary link between the pre-European contact society and its laws and customs, and the claim group and its laws and customs, may be inferred primarily from continuity, without necessarily resorting to a close examination of the societies and their laws and customs. The evidence of actual events will demonstrate continuity. Even if the history commences shortly after first European contact, it may be reasonable to assume that such a stable society was unlikely to have arisen in the period between contact and the commencement of historical records. In the latter approach, the applicant will seek to demonstrate continuity of the pre-sovereignty society, and of acknowledgement and observance of its laws and customs, by examination of those societies and their laws and customs at two or more points of time, inviting an inference as to continuity. Of course there is no clear distinction between these two approaches. Many, perhaps most, cases will involve elements of both. However it must be kept in mind that it is necessary to demonstrate both a pre-sovereignty society having laws and customs, from which the laws and customs of the claim group are derived, and continuity of the pre-sovereignty society, including its laws and customs. Clear evidence of the existence of such a society and acknowledgement and observance of its laws and customs shortly after first European contact, and continuity thereafter, may satisfy both requirements, the first, by available inference and the second, directly. Clear evidence of a pre-sovereignty society and its laws and customs, of genealogical links between that society and the claim group, and an apparent similarity of laws and customs may justify an inference of continuity. However when the evidence as to both aspects is weak, the combined effect may, in some respects, be further to undermine, rather than to strengthen, the claim. Of course that is not the problem which I am presently addressing. I am presently addressing the adequacy, for the purpose of ss 190A and 190B, of the factual basis advanced as underlying the applicant's claim. However, to the extent that the applicant relies, in that process, upon inferences, the above remarks may have some relevance. The applicant starts with the claim group and its existing laws and customs, and effectively asserts that such laws and customs are traditional because, as it claims, they have been handed down from generation to generation. In fact there is very little in the affidavits which addresses the way in which the claim group's laws and customs relating to rights and interests in land and waters have been derived. The closest that Mr Santo comes to the subject is in para 2.7 of his affidavit of 11 September 2006, relating to the boundaries of Gudjala country, and in para 2.14, relating to place names. Paragraph 4.10 dealing with \"recorders\" may also be relevant to the method of transmission of knowledge. Yorta Yorta establishes that a society and its laws and customs are inextricably linked. It is impossible to identify a system of laws and customs as such without identifying the society which recognizes and adheres to those laws and customs. It would mean nothing to say that A had a legal interest in Blackacre unless one identified, or at least knew, the society which recognized that right. Indeed it appears (at [28]) that in Yorta Yorta the appellants took an approach similar to that urged by the applicant. That approach was rejected by Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ at [56] where their Honours said: For these reasons, it would be wrong to confine an inquiry about native title to an examination of the laws and customs now observed in an indigenous society, or to divorce that inquiry from an inquiry into the society in which the laws and customs in question operate. Further, for the same reason, it would be wrong to confine the inquiry for connection between claimants and the land or waters concerned to an inquiry about the connection said to be demonstrated by the laws and customs which are shown now to be acknowledged and observed by the peoples concerned. Rather, it will be necessary to inquire about the relationship between the laws and customs now acknowledged and observed, and those that were acknowledged and observed before sovereignty, and to do so by considering whether the laws and customs can be said to be the laws and customs of the society whose laws and customs are properly described as traditional laws and customs. (Original emphasis. ) Clearly enough, in order to identify the laws and customs that were acknowledged and observed before sovereignty, it is necessary to identify the persons who acknowledged and observed them, namely the relevant pre-sovereignty society. The applicant seeks support for its submission in the decision in Moses . However it misunderstands that decision. At [322]-[330] the Court considered a particular argument described as the \"reasoning backwards argument\". It seems that on appeal the State had asserted that the primary Judge had erred by adopting a process which involved \"determining that the [claim group] presently exercises native title rights and interests in relation to land, and ... then assuming that traditional laws or customs had been acknowledged and observed since the acquisition of European sovereignty. \" See [323]. The impugned approach seems very similar to the applicant's submission. The Court rejected this argument, but not upon the basis that such an approach was correct. Rather, the Court held that the primary Judge had recognized the need to determine whether communities occupying the relevant area at sovereignty had maintained their connection with the land and waters by observing traditional laws and acknowledging traditional customs. The applicant also refers to the decision of the Full Court in De Rose v State of South Australia (2003) 133 FCR 325 (\" De Rose \") at [273]-[283]. It submits that the decision establishes that there is no requirement that different families within a group maintain contact with each other in order to be subject to a common body of laws and customs. To the extent that the applicant relies upon the decision in De Rose for that proposition, it has misunderstood that decision. It concerned a claim by persons described as \"Nguraritja\" to native title pursuant to the traditional laws and customs of a larger group known as the \"Western Desert Bloc\". The relevant laws and customs were not those of the Nguraritja but those of the Western Desert Bloc. It is clear that the Court considered that there was such a society which had enjoyed continuous existence and vitality since sovereignty and had traditional laws and customs. The case is of no assistance for present purposes. In any event, I accepted in my earlier reasons that it is not necessary that the apical ancestors be shown to have been members of the one pre-sovereignty society. However, if descent from three apical ancestors is the basis for membership of the claim group, then there must be some connection between them and the relevant pre-sovereignty society from which the claim group asserts that it has derived its native title rights and interests. In my earlier reasons I observed that the applicant had criticized the delegate for seeking to find a society of which the three apical ancestors were the members, asserting that it was not essential to the applicant's case that the existence of such a society be established. That criticism may not have accurately identified the delegate's reasoning. As I understand his reasoning it was that evidence that three women, who may have met or known each other, could not, without more, constitute a society, particularly given the absence of any identified men. I suspect that just as the applicant misunderstood the delegate's reasoning, the delegate may have misunderstood the applicant's claim. The latter misunderstanding may have been the result of the extreme lack of clarity with which it is expressed and the fact that, in order to identify it, it is necessary to trawl through various parts of the application and the affidavits. My understanding of the applicant's claim as to the traditional nature of the claim group's laws and customs is primarily that they are presently acknowledged and observed, coupled with assertions that they have been passed down from generation to generation by the claim group, and that the claim area was, prior to first European contact, that of the Gudjala people, a description which the claim group also applies to itself. Some evidence from Mr Hagen generally supports these assertions. He also says something about the named apical ancestors and a little about Aboriginal laws and customs. I will return to his report at a later stage. There is a substantial amount of evidence in the affidavits and the report concerning current laws and customs which, it is asserted, are \"traditional\", but little of it relates to rights and interests in land and waters. In para 40 of its submissions, the applicant refers to annexures C and E to the submissions as demonstrating the factual basis of the applicant's case. Annexure C purports to address different aspects of subs 190B(5). As I understand that annexure it sets out the parts of the material which address the following issues: (a) that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area; (b) that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to a claim to the native title rights and interests; and (c) that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs. Although these three aspects relate to the alleged existence of the claimed native title rights, there is no mention of the concept of a pre-sovereignty society having laws and customs concerning such rights and interests. This is consistent with the submission in para 38 that the applicant need only demonstrate a \"normative system at the time of sovereignty\" without reference to the society to which it relates. I will summarize most of the evidence in a very general way. It is summarized in detail in my earlier reasons. I will, however, deal with Mr Hagen's evidence in detail. Association with the claim area In connection with point (a) above, the applicant refers to Sch F to the application and to Mr Hagen's report, the two affidavits of Mr Santo and that of Ms McLean. Schedule F to the application asserts compliance with subs 190B(5) and then states: The native title rights and interests claimed are those possessed under the traditional laws and customs of the Gudjala People which together form part of a body of customary law that is part of a broader system of Aboriginal culture. The broader system is a comprehensive body of law covering cultural values, norms of social behaviour and principles that comprise the land law component of that body of law that govern the land interests of the claim group. The acquisition of land interests is by descent from ancestors and derived from fundamental rights of possession and ownership of land. Examples are then given. The reference in Sch F to \"a broader system of Aboriginal culture\" is not developed or particularized, but there is a possible reference to it in Mr Hagen's report. The relevant parts of that report are said to be pages 3-6 and 15. The numbering system used in the application appears to be a little different from that used by the applicant in its submissions. Pages 3-6 are probably those numbered 33-36. Those pages include information concerning the apical ancestors and a general reference to authorities which support \"Gudjala interests in the current claim area\". Page 15 (p 45) contains Mr Hagen's conclusions. The reference to Mr Santo's affidavit of 24 January 2006 is to paras 1-8. They deal with the history of his family. The reference to Ms McLean's affidavit is to paras 1-6 dealing with her family. The reference to Mr Santo's affidavit of 11 September 2006 is to paras 1.1-1.15 dealing with himself and his family. Traditional laws and customs The applicant identifies as relevant to this aspect Schs F and G to the application, Mr Hagen's report and the three affidavits. I have already dealt with Sch F. Schedule G, at paras (a)-(i), identifies certain aspects of land use which are not relevant for my present purpose which is to identify the factual basis for alleging that the claim group's laws and customs are traditional. The reference to Mr Hagen's report is to pp 7-13, 14 and 15 (probably pp 37-43, 44 and 45). This includes the parts headed \"Traditional Laws and Customs of the Predecessors\", \"Laws and Customs Underpinning Interests in Land Today\", \"Do the native title claim group currently carry on any activities in relation to the land or waters? If so, what are these activities? \" and \"Conclusions\". The reference to Mr Santo's affidavit of 24 January 2006 is to paras 10-20 which relate primarily to Mr Santo's own experiences and activities. Ms McLean, in the identified paras (7-9) of her affidavit, also deals with her position and experience within the Gudjala community. Paragraphs 2.4-2.7, 2.13, 2.14, 2.16, 3.1-3.8 and 4.1-4.13 in Mr Santo's affidavit of 11 September 2006 deal with the present relationship between the Gudjala claim group and adjoining groups and Mr Santo's own experiences and activities, including his experience of some matters which might be described as current laws and customs concerning land and its use. Mr Santo also makes assertions about his descent from Ms Thomson. He claims that she was a \"full-blood Gurrdjal Aboriginal\". The claim group continues to hold native title The applicant refers again to Schs F and G to the application, Mr Hagen's report and to the three affidavits. The relevant passages in Schs F and G appear to concern the identification of current activities on the claim area. The reference to Mr Hagen's report is to pp 8-15 (38-45) under the headings \"Laws and Customs Underpinning Interests in Land Today\", \"Do the native title claim group currently carry on any activities in relation to the land and waters? If so, what are those activities? \" and \"Conclusions\". The reference to Mr Santo's affidavit of 24 January 2006 is to paras 9-21. Again, they deal with Mr Santo's own activities. The reference to Ms McLean's affidavit is to paras 7 and 9 to which I have previously referred. They relate to her own experience. The reference to Mr Santo's affidavit of 11 September 2006 is to paras 2.1-6.12. They deal in some detail with current laws and customs and Mr Santo's activities. They include his assertion of descent from Ms Thomson and that she was a \"full blood Gurrdjal Aboriginal\" and information concerning existing kinship arrangements and ritual. In para 40 of the submissions there is also a reference to Annexure E to the submissions. That annexure identifiers references in the material to particular rules, laws and customs. They are all based upon the material to which I have already referred although, in some cases, the annexure refers to the identification of that material in my earlier reasons. As far as I can see, save for Mr Hagen's report, none of the material offers a factual basis for the implicitly alleged existence of a pre-sovereignty society or its laws and customs, save for some implied or actual assertions that such laws and customs were the same as present laws and customs. As I have said, the applicant's position seems to be that it need not demonstrate such a society, other than by pointing to the claim group's own laws and customs, asserting that they have been handed down from generation to generation, and inviting the inference that they were the laws and customs of a pre-sovereignty society called Gudjala. For reasons which I have given, I do not accept that submission. The applicant asserts, perhaps correctly, that those occupying the claim area at or about the time of sovereignty described themselves as Gudjala people. The claim group now identifies itself using the same name. Laws and customs are also described as being \"Gudjala\". In so far as it refers to the claim group, the word \"Gudjala\" must be taken to mean members of the claim group, that is, descendants of the apical ancestors. However no attempt has been made to identify the meaning of the word when applied to those persons who occupied the claim area at the time of first European contact. Nor, apart from Mr Hagen's affidavit, has anything been said about the laws and customs of that pre-sovereignty society, other than that they must have been the same as existing laws and customs. In my view, to assert that current laws and customs are \"traditional\" is not to provide a factual basis for that assertion, even in a general way. Similarly, to assert that they have been handed down from generation to generation is to do no more than re-state the claim that they are traditional. This problem is connected with the way in which the claim group is described. I have adopted a construction of that description which enables it to meet the requirements of s 190B(3). However, as I have previously observed, that merely defers the problems inherent in the description to the time at which s 190B(5) is considered. Because the applicant does not demonstrate any connection between the apical ancestors and a pre-existing society and its laws and customs relating to land and waters, there is no explanation as to how current laws and customs of the claim group can be traditional. With the exception of the one assertion by Mr Santo as to Ms Thomson being Gudjala, there is no assertion that the apical ancestors were Gudjala people, although such an assertion may be implicit in the material. More significantly, there is no explanation as to what was meant by that description in the pre-sovereignty society. Another aspect deserves comment at this stage. There is a degree of emphasis, at least by implication, upon the dates of birth of the apical ancestors. In fact, it is not clear that any of them was born prior to first European contact. That would not necessarily matter if it were alleged that they were born into a society which had existed prior to such contact, or that they subsequently became members of such a society in accordance with its laws and customs. However that subject is simply not addressed. As a result the presence of these three women in the claim area at, or at some time after first European contact says nothing about any society existing prior to European contact. This is particularly so given that Ms Hann and Ms Thomson are associated with stations. Similarly, the assertion that those who occupied the area prior to European contact were described as Gudjala says nothing about that society, or about its laws and customs. To infer that such statement is part of the factual basis of the applicant's claim would be to confuse the claim with its factual basis. Mr Hagen's report Mr Hagen's report deals firstly with the apical ancestors. In discussing that aspect of the report, I will also refer to other evidence concerning the apical ancestors. Ms Hann was probably the eldest of the apical ancestors. She was the great-grandmother of Ms McLean to whom I have referred. Ms McLean says that Ms Hann was a young girl when the Maryvale station was set up, and that she worked there. Ms McLean also asserts that Ms Hann \"tried to escape to join her people in the bush but was found and brought back\". It seems that Ms Hann's daughter, Sadie, Sadie's daughter, Stella and Stella's daughter, Ms McLean were all born on Maryvale Station. However none of this suggests that Maryvale station was the location of any part of a pre-sovereignty society of which Ms Hann was a member. That Ms Hann sought to escape to join her people suggests that at that time, it was not such a location. Mr Hagen says that Ms Hann was identified with the Maryvale/Bluff Downs/Sandy Creek area, to the north of the Great Basalt Walls, and that her birth date was possibly around 1855 to 1860. Bluff Downs is also a station. Mr Hagen asserts that the descendants of Ms Hann are the \"descendants of Gudjala people with traditional interests including the Charters Towers area\". However neither Mr Hagen nor Ms McLean directly asserts that Ms Hann was, herself, recognized as a Gudjala woman, that she so identified herself, or that she was a member of a Gudjala society. Ms McLean does not place Ms Hann at Bluff Downs, nor does she offer any opinion as to where Ms Hann was born. It seems that she was not born at Maryvale as that station was set up when she was a young girl. It is possible that there was a society to which Ms Hann belonged, located in the region of the Maryvale station prior to its establishment, and that such community was displaced by that establishment. However no such factual basis for the claim has been asserted. Mr Santo claims to be descended from Maggie Thomson, and that she was born in the mid-1800s at Lolworth Range within the claim area. Ms Thomson is the second oldest of the apical ancestors. Ms Thomson went to the Bluff Downs station after it was established. There is no suggestion of any indigenous society in that location of which Ms Thomson was, or became, a member. It is said that her tribe came from the Lolworth Range area and were subjected to a massacre in the 1860s. Ms Thomson escaped into the Basalt country and then went to Bluff Downs where she was taken in by the station-owner's wife, Mrs Hann. This occurred during the 1860s. All of Ms Thomson's children were born at Bluff Downs. Mr Santo's grandfather was one of those children. He was born in 1882. Mr Hagen understands that Ms Thomson was born around 1860 and is identified with Bluff Downs and the nearby Great Basalt Walls in the heart of Gudjala country. Mr Santo claims in para 4.1 of his later affidavit that Ms Thomson was a full-blood \"Gurrdjal Aboriginal\". However he does not claim that she was identified as such during her lifetime, or identified herself as such. He offers no factual basis for his claim. Nor does he explain what it means to say that Ms Thomson was \"Gudjala\". A family which Mr Hagen describes as the \"Huen-Kerr\" family is descended from Alice Anning who was born in the 1860s or 1870s and is also said to be associated with Bluff Downs. She is the third oldest of the apical ancestors. That family is also said to be descended from Cissy McGregor who was born at St Paul's pastoral station in about 1880. St Paul's is east/south-east of Charters Towers. It is outside the combined claim area (this claim area and that of the core country claim) in an area claimed by the Birri people. It may be that it is also claimed as traditional Gudjala country, but no such assertion is made in the material. The delegate accepted that Ms Hann, Ms Thomson and Ms Anning were associated with the claim area at the time at which the first European settlers arrived. That may have been an unduly favourable assessment from the applicant's point of view. Their birth dates would suggest that Ms Hann might have been so associated, and that it is barely possible that Ms Thomson was so associated. No affidavit by a person claiming to be a descendant of either Ms Anning or Ms McGregor is before me for present purposes. There is no claim that Ms Anning or Ms McGregor identified herself as Gudjala or was identified as such by others. Again, there is no claim that they were members of any identifiable pre-sovereignty society. Ms McGregor's birth date is well after first European contact. Ms Hann, Ms Thomson and Ms Anning may all have been associated with Bluff Downs station. However one must look at the circumstances of such association. Ms Thomson took refuge there from violence which was occurring elsewhere and subsequently worked there. The nature of Ms Hann's association with Bluff Downs, and that of Ms Anning, are not stated. If Aboriginal people seeking refuge and/or work assembled on a cattle station, presumably established and managed by Europeans, the group of itself, and without more, could not constitute a pre-sovereignty society. It would be a society formed after first European contact. Ms McLean associates Ms Hann with Maryvale station, not Bluff Downs. She went there to work, tried to leave to join her people, but was returned to Maryvale. As I have said, none of this suggests membership of an identifiable pre-sovereignty society at Maryvale. In so analysing the evidence, I do not mean to impose a particular burden upon the applicant. I am rather analysing various, largely disconnected, and very general, assertions with a view to identifying available inferences as to the existence of a pre-sovereignty society relevant to the present claim group. Many of the assertions may, in isolation, suggest that a particular inference is available, but such inference may not be available when the whole of the applicant's assertions are taken into account. Mr Hagen says that the Santo-Boyd family have maintained a presence in the claim area at all times since non-indigenous occupation, and that there is \"strong support for the view that they are descendants of Gudjala people with traditional interests\". The word \"traditional\" may or may not be used in the same sense as it is used in the Act. I am willing to accept that the present Santo-Boyd family identifies itself as Gudjala, and that they claim to be descended from people who so identified themselves. I also accept that they are descended from Maggie Thomson. However there is no claim that Ms Thomson identified herself as a Gudjala woman, or that others so identified her. In the absence of such a claim, one must look for some other link between her and her descendants on the one hand, and the relevant pre-sovereignty society on the other, but none is claimed, except for Mr Santo's assertion that she was Gudjala. As to the Reid-Masso family, Mr Hagen says that they trace their ancestry to Topsy Hann, and that the evidence locates their known Gudjala ancestors to the west/north-west of Charters Towers. It is not clear to me that this means anything more than that they claim descent from Ms Hann who was associated with that area. I accept as much. The question again is how that relates them to a pre-sovereignty society. Similar comments apply to the Huen-Kerr family. Mr Hagen says that the available material supports the identification of the current claimants and applicants as members of the Gudjala group on the basis of their descent from Alice Huen, Cissy McGregor, Maggie Thomson and Topsy Hann. However the inclusion of those names in the one sentence does not constitute a factual basis supporting the claim that native title rights and interests have been derived under traditional laws and customs. Mr Hagen says that contemporary members of the group continue to maintain an association with the Gudjala area, as did their ancestral predecessors. That also says nothing about the traditional nature of relevant laws and customs. I have observed that Mr Hagen's report bears upon the identity of a pre-sovereignty society and its laws and customs. Mr Hagen says that documentary support for Gudjala interests in the claim area can be found in the work of Curr, Tindale, Sutton, Tsunoda and other authors, and that the evidence of senior Gudjala men and those of other neighbouring groups in the 19th and early 20th centuries clearly locate the Gudjala in the Charters Towers area. Mr Hagen concludes from this that it can reasonably be concluded that the land included in the present claim traditionally belongs to the Gudjala people. However Charters Towers is in the extreme south-eastern corner of the claim area. It is difficult to see how association with Charters Towers can, by itself, say much about the claim area as a whole. I accept for present purposes that people called Gudjala were located in the claim area at the time of first European contact. That says nothing about the claim group. Mr Hagen then considers the traditional laws and customs \"of the predecessors\". He refers to a statement by Edward Palmer, writing in 1883, about indigenous connection to land in north-west Queensland. The combined claim area can, in no sense, be described as being in north-west Queensland. Its eastern extremity is within about 100 km of the east coast, and its north-eastern extremity is about 60 km south-east of Townsville. The total width of the claim area is about 200 km from east to west. From north to south it is a little more than 100 km at its widest point. I raised this matter with counsel in argument. Our exchange appears at TS 18 l 38-TS 19 l 41. I see no basis for inferring that Mr Hagen's citation of Palmer's work, described by him as concerning indigenous connections to the land in north-west Queensland, can be applied to the Gudjala claim area. If there is some rational basis for so doing, it should have been included in the report. It is possible that the reference to Palmer's work is in connection with the \"broader system of Aboriginal culture\" referred to is Sch F to the application. No attempt has been made to explain the factual basis of that assertion. As I have observed, Mr Hagen has not sought to link the Gudjala position to that in north-west Queensland. Indeed, Mr Hagen's view that Palmer's work was geographically specific suggests that there is no basis for assuming its universal application. Mr Hagen also refers to an article by WE Roth. He does not say that the article concerns the Gudjala people. Even assuming that it does so, it says nothing about pre-sovereignty laws and customs concerning rights and interests in land and waters. It is therefore of little or no relevance for present purposes. None of this seems to add anything to the identification of a relevant pre-sovereignty society or its laws and customs relating to rights and interests in land and waters. Mr Hagen then considers the \"law and customs underpinning interests in land today\". I have no difficulty in accepting the various assertions which he makes in that context. He also addresses the extent to which the claim group currently carries on activities in relation to the claim area. Again, I have no difficulty in accepting his assertions. Mr Hagen reaches three conclusions. First, he concludes that: The native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area. The areas concerned are traditionally associated with the Gudjala peoples. The current claimants are members of this group by descent. Members of the group continue to reside within their traditional lands to pursue other land-based activity upon them. I take issue with Mr Hagen's use of the words \"traditionally\" and \"traditional\" if he intended that they have meanings similar to that of the word \"traditional\" as used in s 190A and otherwise in the Act in connection with laws and customs. It is probable that the words were not used in that sense. If they are to be so understood, then the fact remains that there is no stated factual basis for inferring the existence of a pre-sovereignty society with laws and customs from which the current claim group and its laws and customs are derived. In any event Mr Hagen does not identify any laws and customs concerning rights and interests in land and waters of an identified pre-sovereignty society which can be linked to the claim group through the apical ancestors. The second conclusion is that: The native title claim group continues to acknowledge and observe the traditional laws and customs pertaining to land in the area. Discussion of such laws and customs in the early literature pertaining to the area and my own observations of their activity today, indicates a high degree of congruence between underlying legal principles followed then and now. I accept that the applicant claims that the claim group acknowledges and observes certain laws and customs pertaining to the claim area. However I again reject use of the word \"traditional\" simply because no pre-sovereignty society has been identified for the purpose of identifying its relevant laws and customs so as to demonstrate that the claim groups' laws and customs are traditional in the sense identified in Yorta Yorta . As to the second sentence, the reference to \"early literature\" is quite unclear. If Mr Hagen is referring to Palmer's writings, then it is curious that he has at no time explained why they should be applied to the Gudjala people. As to Roth's article, it does not deal with laws and customs concerning land and waters. If, in fact, Mr Hagen is referring to other \"early literature\", then it is curious that he has not identified it. The reference in the report to Curr, Tindall, Sutton and Tsunoda is in connection with location of the claim area, not laws and customs. Thus there is no factual basis for concluding that there were pre-sovereignty laws and customs with which to compare the claim group's laws and customs. The third conclusion is that: The native title claim group's ongoing observance of traditional laws and customs is consistent with the maintenance of traditional rights and interests in the land subject to the claim. This statement begs the question, namely whether the claim group's laws and customs, which give rise to the claimed rights and interests in relation to land and waters, are \"traditional\". I accept that Mr Hagen's professional opinions may, in certain circumstances, be, themselves, facts and therefore may be part of the factual basis advanced for the purposes of s 190B. I accept, also, that in some circumstances, it may be appropriate for certain expert opinions to be expressed without stating the factual basis which underlies them. However, in the present case, no attempt has been made to identify a pre-sovereignty society, the laws and customs which such a society may have acknowledged and observed in connection with rights and interests in land and waters, any connection between the apical ancestors and such society, or any connection between pre-sovereignty and current laws and customs of the relevant kind. The question is whether the applicant has stated the factual basis of its claim to the extent required by the Act. If it offers no explanation as to how the claim group's laws and customs can be sourced to those of a society existing prior to first European contact, then that obligation has not been discharged. In the present context, I cannot see that Mr Hagen, any more than the applicant or its deponents, can simply re-state the claim so that such re-statement becomes the factual basis of the claim. OUTCOME I turn to the provisions of s 190B. Paragraph 190B(5)(a) \"that the native title claim group have, and the predecessors of those persons had, an association with the area ... . \" In so far as concerns the apical ancestors, there is evidence that each of the three women had some association with the combined claimed area although Ms Anning's alleged association is less clear than that of each of the other two. Mr Santo's grandfather and father appear also to have association with the claim area, as does Mr Santo himself. I am satisfied that there is evidence of a factual basis for the assertion that the Santo-Boyd family (as identified by Mr Hagen) had an association with the area sufficient to satisfy the requirements of para 190B(5)(a). Ms McLean demonstrates that she, her mother and her grandmother were all born on Maryvale station within the claim area and lived their lives in Charters Towers, also within the claim area. Ms McLean's great-grandmother, Ms Hann, also lived there. There is a factual basis for asserting that the Reid-Masso family have the required association with the relevant area. The Huen-Kerr family is rather more problematic. Ms Anning is said to be \"also of Bluff Downs\". I take this to mean that she was associated with the Bluff Downs station. It is said that members of the Huen-Kerr family continue to live in Charters Towers, play a prominent role in the affairs of the indigenous community and that \"documentary and oral historical evidence indicates an unbroken chain of association with the claim area. \" It is curious that no specific factual material is provided concerning this aspect. It is also curious that the applicant does not rely on affidavit material from members of this family. Descent from Ms McGregor does not seem to help as it is not asserted that she had any association with the claim area, although it is asserted that her descendants, also descended from Ms Anning, did so. However I accept Mr Hagen's assertion of an unbroken chain of association. This leads to the conclusion that the applicant satisfies para 190B(5)(a). Paragraph 190B(5)(b) \"that there exist traditional laws acknowledged by, and traditional customs observed by, the native title claim group that give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests ...\" I accept that there is a demonstrated factual basis for the claim that laws acknowledged by, and customs observed by the claim group give rise to the claim to native title rights and interests. However I do not accept that there is a factual basis for the assertion that such laws and customs are traditional. I have given my reasons. The applicant does not satisfy the requirements of para 190B(5)(b). Paragraph 190B(5)(c) \"that the native title claim group have continued to hold the native title in accordance with those traditional laws and customs\" It follows from my conclusion concerning the preceding paragraph that the applicant has not satisfied this requirement. I do not mean to exclude the possibility that the applicant may be able to remedy the deficiencies in the material to which I have pointed. However it will require a more disciplined approach to the Act than has yet been demonstrated. SUBSECTIONS 190B(6) AND (7) It follows that the applicant has not satisfied the requirements of s 190B(6). As to s 190B(7), much may depend upon the meaning of the term \"traditional physical connection\". I have not been referred to any authority on the point. It seems likely that such connection must be in exercise of a right or interest in land or waters held pursuant to traditional laws and customs. For the reasons which I have given, the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied. ORDERS The application must be dismissed.

The relief sought is that the respondents, Optus Mobile Pty Limited and Optus Networks Pty Limited ( Optus ), be restrained until further order of the Court from blocking its customers' access to Pivotel's telecommunications network and/or Pivtoel's Australian digital mobile telephone numbers. FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES The primary circumstances in which this matter comes before me today are disclosed in two affidavits. The first is an affidavit of Robert Sakker sworn 22 December 2009. Mr Sakker is the executive director and company secretary of Pivotel Group Pty Limited ( Pivotel Group ) and its wholly owned subsidiaries, which include the applicant, Pivotel. The second is an affidavit of Caitlin Murray sworn 23 December 2009. Ms Murray is a solicitor employed by the solicitors for Optus. Ms Murray has provided her affidavit largely on the basis of information from Lynette Rieper. Ms Rieper is the corporate counsel for Optus. Insofar as relevant, the two affidavits disclose that Pivotel Group is a licensed telecommunications carrier under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and is the nominated carrier for mobile satellite services provided in Australia using a particular satellite. Pivotel Group has held a carrier licence under s 56(1) of the Telecommunications Act since on or about 4 March 2003. According to Mr Sakker there are five telecommunications carriers that operate public mobile telephone networks: Telstra, Optus, Hutchison (or 3), Vodafone Network Pty Limited ( Vodafone ) and Pivotel. Mr Sakker says that because Hutchison and Vodafone have now merged their businesses, effectively, there are four mobile telephone communication carriers in Australia. Pivotel apparently considers that its major competitors at a retail level in the Australian mobile satellite services market are Telstra and Optus. Consistent with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act , Pivotel was allocated a range of digital mobile telephone numbers by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The allocation of these numbers commenced in about 2004. Mr Sakker explains that each of the carriers has a telecommunications switch used for interconnection with other carriers in each capital city of Australia. \"Interconnection\" is a link that allows traffic from one carrier to be passed to another carrier. Pivotel has a direct interconnection link for mobile telecommunications traffic with Vodafone, but no other carrier. Pivotel, accordingly, has contractual and other arrangements with Vodafone by which traffic to and from Pivotel numbers is transmitted by an originating carrier, be it Pivotel or another carrier, via Vodafone as the transit carrier. Vodafone itself then has arrangements with other Australian carriers pursuant to which it carries this traffic. The evidence discloses that there is a separate set of proceedings in this Court between entities known as Mediatel Pty Limited ( Mediatel ) (and associated entities, referred to below as the Mediatel interests ) and Optus. Those proceedings were commenced in March 2009. Mr Sakker has had involvement as an expert witness in those proceedings. Documents from the Mediatel proceedings and other documents in respect of this interlocutory application show that from about August 2009 Optus began to block calls from Optus's customers to telephone numbers that Optus considered were associated with the Mediatel interests. Vodafone (being the transit carrier) considers that Optus is obliged to pay nine cents per minute to Vodafone for all traffic to the Pivotel network. Optus, however, considers that calls from its customers to Pivotel phone numbers are being used improperly to obtain access not to a genuine Pivotel handset but through an interactive voice recognition system to overseas destinations. This is referred to in the evidence as a \"two stage dialling process\". Before 21 December 2009 Mr Sakker was aware that some 94 Pivotel numbers identified by Optus as being associated with the Mediatel interests had been blocked. However, according to Mr Sakker, on 21 December 2009 he first received notice that Optus had taken steps to block all of Optus's customers from making any calls to the Pivotel network. The result is that Pivotel customers could still make calls to Optus customers but Optus customers could not make calls to any Pivotel customers. There seems to be no factual issue that Optus did in fact take steps on or about 20 December 2009 which had the consequence Mr Sakker identified. Optus's decision-making process in this regard is disclosed in Ms Murray's affidavit. Ms Murray records (consistent with Mr Sakker's evidence) that Optus does not have a direct interconnection with Pivotel; indeed, there is no contractual relationship between Optus and Pivotel. The relevant contractual relationships appear to be between Optus and its customers, as well as Optus and Vodafone, and Pivotel and its customers, as well as Pivotel and Vodafone. According to Ms Murray since December 2008 Optus has withheld payments from Vodafone for calls to numbers that it considers to be \"non-genuine traffic\" numbers --- that is numbers associated with the two stage dialling process referred to above. Ms Murray says that as at the date of her affidavit (23 December 2009) the total amount of payments which Optus has withheld from Vodafone in respect of such calls is some $6.1 million. Further, the dispute about any liability that Optus may have to Vodafone in relation to that amount and, presumably, other disputed liabilities incurred thereafter, is a part of the Mediatel proceedings. Ms Murray also records that Optus has formed a commercial view that it does not wish to carry traffic that does not ordinarily terminate on the handset of an end-user on the Pivotel network. While Optus disputes the claim by Vodafone for payment at the rate of nine cents per minute for this traffic, Optus also does not wish to become potentially liable to Vodafone for any future traffic which it considers to be non-genuine. In para 30 of her affidavit Ms Murray identifies the process by which numbers were blocked by Optus, being those numbers which it considers to be non-genuine traffic. This process apparently increased in frequency and extent from about November 2009. Until the commencement of these proceedings, Optus received no complaint from Pivotel about the blocking of individual numbers. Ms Murray's affidavit records that she is informed by Ms Rieper that as of 20 December 2009, and given Optus's commercial decision about the traffic it did not wish to carry, Optus took steps to block all calls going from the Optus network to numbers associated with the Pivotel network. Optus did so having regard to the fact that, according to it, it could not find any other way to prevent \"non-genuine\" traffic. Further, Optus is concerned about its existing and potential future liability to Vodafone, which Optus disputes. Optus is also concerned about the potential effect of the dispute with Vodafone and Optus's ongoing commercial relationship with Vodafone which is very valuable and said to be worth many millions of dollars per year. This is in circumstances where, if the raw number of nine cents a minute is taken as a starting point, Ms Murray's affidavit (para 34) identifies a potential liability on the part of Optus to Vodafone ranging from $214,910 to $966,630 per month. It is the blocking by Optus of all calls from its customers to all Pivotel mobile phone numbers that has prompted the application for interlocutory relief on an urgent basis today. Pivotel says that there is a serious question to be tried on a number of bases and that the balance of convenience weighs in its favour, including having regard to the fact that it is willing to proffer an undertaking as to damages in the usual form on behalf of not only Pivotel but also each and every subsidiary of Pivotel Group both individually and jointly. SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED? Pivotel's questions The first question arises from Pivotel's claim that Optus's conduct in blocking access (as identified above) constitutes anti-competitive conduct within the meaning of s 151AJ of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and thus in breach of s 151AK of that Act. Optus is a carrier. Pivotel claims that there is sufficient evidence to be satisfied that, at least on a prima facie basis and assuming all other things remain the same at the final hearing, Optus has a substantial degree of power in two telecommunications markets, being the ordinary mobile phone market and the satellite market. This substantial degree of power is evidenced by Optus's capacity to prevent its customers from accessing Pivotel handsets. Pivotel claims that, on the evidence as it currently stands, Optus has used its market power to withhold or prevent the provision of a service. This use is sufficient for the purposes of s 151AJ to constitute the taking advantage of the power in the mobile telephone or any other market, and has had the relevant effect proscribed by the legislation (namely, a substantial lessening of competition). On Pivotel's case (and as supported by its evidence) there is a national market for ordinary mobile telephony services and a national market for satellite mobile telephony services. The first market has four carriers. The second market has three carriers. These markets have high barriers to entry. Interconnection between all of the carriers, submits Pivotel, is critical to each market. The capacity to prevent interconnection, at least on a prima facie basis, is taking advantage of the power in the market, the effect of which, Pivotel contends, is to substantially lessen competition in both the mobile telephony and satellite markets. Pivotel says it is apparent that if an Optus customer cannot ring a Pivotel mobile or satellite telephone then Pivotel customers will be discouraged from using the Pivotel satellite mobile telephony services. Further, in terms of the market for ordinary mobile telephony services, Optus customers will be discouraged from using Optus's services. Pivotel referred to the decision in Boral Besser Masonry Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2003) 215 CLR 374 ; [2003] HCA 5 at [136] and [137] to support its submission that pricing is not the only aspect of market behaviour that manifests power. Other aspects, said Gleeson CJ and Callinan J, may include the capacity to withhold supply and the capacity to act without constraint. Pivotel submits that for the purposes of this interlocutory application it has shown sufficiently that this has occurred. The second question arises from Pivotel's claim for breach of s 46 of the Trade Practices Act (the general misuse of market power provision). Pivotel acknowledges that s 46 requires it to establish that the use of the market power was for the proscribed purposes of either eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor or deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct. Pivotel otherwise relies on alleged breaches of ss 51AB and 51AC of the Trade Practices Act , each of which, in relation to either the supply of goods or services to a person or the carrying out of business transactions as nominated, proscribes unconscionable conduct. Pivotel also invokes s 52 of the Trade Practices Act which proscribes misleading or deceptive conduct. Optus's response and conclusions Optus disputes the existence of a prima facie case against it. First, Optus makes a relatively formal submission that Pivotel is a member of a group of entities with a common holding company (Pivotel Group Pty Limited) in circumstances where it is not clear from the evidence which company has the telephone subscribers. Consequently, according to Optus even if Pivotel made out its causes of action it is not clear that the named applicant is the relevant entity which will suffer loss or damage. It seems to me that this submission can be put to one side relatively easily, given Mr Sakker's evidence. It appears that at least one relevant applicant is the moving party in these proceedings. While it may be that there are other potential applicants, I do not need to resolve that issue now. Accordingly, I am not persuaded that this submission should be accepted. Optus also contends that Pivotel has not identified any legal basis upon which it could be said that Optus must have Pivotel's business foisted upon it in circumstances where Optus has made a commercial decision that it does not wish to carry calls to Pivotel. As noted, there is no contractual relationship between Pivotel and Optus. According to Optus, Pivotel has not identified any regulatory provision, contractual entitlement or other legal basis which would require Optus to carry calls to the Pivotel network. This submission, however, cannot be assessed separately from the potential causes of action upon which Pivotel has commenced these proceedings, being the provisions of the Trade Practices Act to which I have referred. In terms of s 151AJ of the Trade Practices Act , Optus's primary submissions and my conclusions are as follows: (1) First, by reference to evidence of Lawrence Clarke in the Mediatel proceedings, Optus submits that the relevant market is not the mobile telephone market. According to Mr Clarke no mobile handset is required to utilise the services in issue. The services may be accessed from a fixed network service. Further, the service is a one-way, incoming-call only service. The difficulty with this proposition is that Mr Clarke's evidence addresses the Mediatel numbers. The evidence in the present case (as it currently stands) is sufficient to show that Pivotel has some 15,000 numbers allocated to it of which 8000 are satellite users. It is not possible to ascertain from the evidence what proportion of those numbers might be Mediatel numbers. Accordingly, there is evidence to support the submissions made on behalf of Pivotel that there are two relevant markets, the satellite mobile market and ordinary mobile market. (2) Secondly, Optus submits that there is no evidence which allows an inference to be drawn that Optus has taken advantage of any market power. Rather, the evidence shows that Optus would have acted in precisely the same way and on a genuine commercial basis even if it did not have the market power that it was alleged to have. Accordingly, on this submission, competitive conditions are entirely irrelevant. The reason Optus blocked access is because it made a business decision that it is commercially disadvantageous for it to allow access by its customers to the Pivotel network. The decision had nothing whatsoever to do with Optus's competitive position. This is supported by evidence from Ms Murray that Optus does not consider Pivotel to be its commercial competitor. Nevertheless, as Pivotel submitted, the requirement that there be a taking advantage of power in a market, according to Miller's Annotated Trade Practices Act . 30 th ed. Thomson Reuters. Sydney (2009) at [1.151AJ.15], does not involve anything more than the use of the market power involved; predatory intent is not required ( Queensland Wire Industries Proprietary Limited v Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177). On this basis there is evidence capable of supporting an inference that there has been a taking advantage of market power as proscribed by the statute. There is also evidence capable of supporting a conclusion that Optus has a substantial degree of power in the two identified markets. Further, there is evidence capable of supporting a conclusion that the effect of Optus's actions, irrespective of its intention, has or is likely to have been a substantial lessening of competition. On this basis, I am satisfied that Pivotel has established that there is a serious question to be tried in respect of the alleged breach of s 151AJ of the Trade Practices Act . I accept Optus's submission that it is more difficult from the evidence to draw any inference capable of supporting a potential contravention of s 46 of the Trade Practices Act (which requires proof of the proscribed purpose). On balance, I am not satisfied that the evidence has established a prima facie case in respect of a breach of s 46. Similarly, Pivotel's submissions about contraventions of ss 51AB and 51AC, relating to unconscionable conduct, as well as s 52, were by no means as persuasive as its submissions about the existence of a serious question to be tried in respect of s 151AJ. On the evidence, I am not satisfied that there is a serious question to be tried in relation to any of those statutory provisions. However, as I have said, I am satisfied that Pivotel has established a serious question to be tried in respect of anti-competitive conduct proscribed by Pt XIB of the Trade Practices Act (the so-called \"competition rule\") regulating the telecommunications industry (specifically, ss 151CA, 151AJ and 151AK). Insofar as relevant, s 151CA(1) vests power in the Court to grant to any person an injunction in the event of any breach of the competition rule. More relevantly, s 151CA(3) provides that \"[i]f, in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, the Court may grant an interim injunction pending determination of an application under subsection (1)\". I thus have power to grant the relief requested but must now consider where the balance of convenience lies. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE? Optus's submissions Optus disputes where the balance of convenience lies, particularly insofar as the balance is affected by the adequacy of the proffered undertaking as to damages. Optus's submissions in relation to the more general aspects of the balance of convenience also take issue with Pivotel's case based on alleged safety concerns. These are said to arise from the inability of Optus customers to contact Pivotel customers including, for example, contact by various emergency services, there being some evidence that various government and other entities have contracts with both Optus and Pivotel. Optus points out that: - (i) calls can continue to be made to all emergency services, (ii) all outgoing calls can still be made by Pivotel customers, and (iii) all incoming calls can still be received by Pivotel customers other than calls from Optus customers. Further, according to Optus, Pivotel has not adduced cogent evidence that anyone is likely to be disadvantaged. Optus relies also on the fact that its dispute with Vodafone is having a serious impact on its commercial relationship with Vodafone. That relationship is worth many millions of dollars a year. Optus notes that until the events of 20 December 2009, Pivotel made no complaint about Optus blocking individual numbers from August 2009 (albeit accepting that the numbers were blocked at a greater rate from about November 2009). Conclusions Although there is a commercial relationship between Pivotel and the Mediatel interests I am not able to draw any inference on the evidence (as Optus contends I should) that Pivotel has been involved in actions to avoid Optus's blocking conduct. As senior counsel for Pivotel submitted I do not know what proportion of Pivotel numbers has been allocated to the Mediatel interests but I do know that there are 8000 numbers associated with Pivotel satellite phones. I also am prepared to infer on the evidence that while Optus may be exposed to a liability to Vodafone of nine cents a minute on all Pivotel traffic, Optus itself accepts that it would not be providing a services to its customers for free. Accordingly, the actual level of Optus's exposure to Vodafone, while potentially significant, cannot be based on the rate of nine cents a minute. I also accept that the continuation of the blocking will or is likely to cause economic loss to Pivotel. Again, however, I cannot assess the exact nature of that loss. It also seems to me that the potential liability of Pivotel under any undertaking to persons other than Optus involves pure speculation. More importantly than these matters and as Pivotel points out, Optus has been carrying the Pivotel traffic since 2005. The issue about blocking appears to have first arisen, albeit not to Pivotel's knowledge, in August 2009. Before the events of recent days Mr Sakker was aware of some 94 numbers that had been blocked. However, he first became aware of Optus's decision to block all of its customers from accessing the entire Pivotel network on 21 December 2009. There are serious public interest issues in respect of the interconnectivity of the mobile telephone network in Australia. Subject to dealing with the adequacy of the undertaking as to damages, these considerations make it difficult to accept that the balance of convenience is other than one which weighs heavily in favour of Pivotel. Therefore, it seems to me that three factors are of critical importance. First, the traffic in issue has been on the Optus network since some time in 2005. Second, there are serious public interest issues about the interconnectivity of the whole mobile telephony network. By this, I mean the capacity of any person with a mobile phone in Australia to make and receive calls to and from any other number irrespective of the carrier to which that number is allocated. Third, Optus took the action resulting in the blocking of access from its customers to the entire Pivotel network on 20 December 2009 without, apparently, any forewarning or notice to Pivotel that such action was proposed. I should also note that I do not accept Optus's submission that this is a clear case in which damages would be an adequate remedy for Pivotel. This seems to me not to reflect the reality of the situation where no Optus customer, at the moment, can access any Pivotel customer. I accept the evidence of Mr Sakker that the blocking impacts on not only Pivotel customers but also on Optus customers, as well as the overall domestic mobile and national fixed telephony markets for which damages would not be an adequate remedy. I also do not accept that Pivotel is somehow the author of its own misfortune. It is apparent from the evidence that Optus's commercial concern relates to the two stage dialling process. Optus's response of blocking access to the entire Pivotel network, without notice to Pivotel, could not be characterised as Pivotel being the author of its own misfortune. Nor do I accept that Pivotel has delayed in taking action. Mr Sakker's evidence is to the contrary and is sufficient to cause me to reject this allegation. I come then to the undertaking as to damages. There have been forceful submissions put on behalf of Optus that the information available about the financial situation of Pivotel and the other members of Pivotel Group requires me to accept that there are insufficient assets to meet a very potential significant liability on Optus's part (that is, to Vodafone). The difficulty with this submission is that Pivotel has disclosed not only its financial position but the financial position of all of the members of Pivotel Group. I am satisfied on the evidence that Pivotel Group (each member of which is individually and jointly to give the required undertaking) is an ongoing business of substance which has a material excess of assets over liabilities including assets that would seem to be capable of realisation if need be. In these circumstances, having regard to the balance sheets in evidence and given the lack of information about the precise quantity of any exposure under the undertaking, I am satisfied that there are undertakings of genuine worth proffered. FORM OF THE ORDER There is also an issue about the form of the order sought. Although the order sought is framed in negative terms (namely, that Optus cease blocking numbers), Pivotel properly acknowledges that the consequence of any such order has a positive effect, namely, that Optus will be required to carry traffic when it has made a commercial decision that it does not wish to do so. The difficulty for Optus is that Pivotel has established a prima facie case in relation to a potential contravention of s 151AJ of the Trade Practices Act . This provides a proper basis for the making of an order, the effect of which will be to preserve the status quo . The status quo is that the disputed traffic has been carried by Optus on its network since about 2005. Mr Sakker has given evidence, unchallenged on this application, that mobile phone users in Australia generally have an expectation of being able to access all other numbers, be they mobile or fixed landline services. In these circumstances the fact that the granting of an order to Pivotel would have a positive effect does not seem to me to be a sufficient reason to deny interlocutory relief given that Pivotel has established a serious question to be tried and that the balance of convenience is in its favour. I accept Pivotel's submission that it is unsatisfactory to attempt to carve out from the order any capacity for Optus to continue blocking numbers that Optus believes are Mediatel or similar numbers involving a two stage dialling process. I also accept that, in circumstances where it is proffering an undertaking as to damages, Pivotel should not be required as a price of interlocutory relief to provide to Optus a list of all Mediatel numbers, even assuming that it could do so having regard to the restrictions imposed on the disclosure of such information by s 276 of the Telecommunications Act . There is one further issue which relates to the form of the order. It is whether there should be excluded from that order either all Mediatel numbers, the 94 numbers Mr Sakker knew had been blocked before 20 December 2009 or all numbers that Optus blocked on an individual basis before it blocked access to the entire Pivotel network on 20 December 2009. Pivotel's urgent application for relief today was prompted by the action which Optus took on 20 December 2009 to block access to the entire Pivotel network. The minimum relief required to preserve the status quo pending the final resolution of these proceedings is to frame an order that has the effect of reinstating the position as at the date immediately prior to 20 December 2009, that is, before Optus took the step of blocking access to the entire Pivotel network. It seems to me that it should be possible for an unambiguous order to be framed so to achieve this end. CONCLUSION Accordingly, for these reasons, I am satisfied there is a serious question to be tried on the basis identified. I am satisfied that the balance of convenience favours Pivotel. I am satisfied that damages would not be an adequate remedy in the circumstances. I am thus minded to make an injunction in an appropriate form, pending further order of the Court and on the basis of the giving of an appropriately worded undertaking as to damages. I request the parties confer immediately to that end. I certify that the preceding thirty-five (35) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jagot.

The Application has been before a Registrar of this Court on three separate occasions beginning in late September 2008. 2 The Application came before me for the first time on 19 November 2008 on which occasion I fixed the matter for hearing today and made directions designed to have the matter ready for hearing today. When the matter was called on before me on 19 November 2008 I informed the applicant that it would be in his best interests to attempt to secure legal representation for the matter generally and, in particular, for the hearing. I did so because I was concerned that the amount claimed in the Bankruptcy Notice was a relatively small sum of money and did not seem to justify the expense that had already been incurred and was likely to be incurred in respect of a contest which, as matters seemed to me then, would probably not be able to be litigated in the present Application. 3 When the matter was called on before me this morning, the applicant informed me that he wished to apply for an adjournment of the hearing of the Application because he was attempting to obtain legal representation. In the course of submissions made by the applicant in support of his application for an adjournment, he informed me from the Bar table that he has taken his case (and I will call it \" his case \" for the time being without expanding upon just what this case might be) to about nine litigation funders and to three firms of solicitors over a period of time, commencing no later than February 2008. 4 Not one of those litigation funders and none of the law firms was prepared to take on his case. 5 The applicant informed me from the Bar table that Mr Morahan of Counsel had looked at his case and had indicated to him as recently as last Thursday that his case was a good case. Mr Morahan does not appear for the applicant today and no other lawyer has been retained to appear on behalf of the applicant today. The applicant comes to Court to argue the matter on his own behalf. 6 It seems to me that the applicant has had ample opportunity to organise legal representation for this hearing and has either chosen not to do so or has been unable to do so. In those circumstances, bearing in mind the nature of the Application and the number of occasions it has been before the Court, and, in particular, bearing in mind the fact that, despite all of the applicant's efforts to date, he has not secured legal representation, it seems to me that there is no point adjourning the matter and that the matter should proceed today. The respondent is entitled to have the Application heard without further delay. Accordingly, I refuse the applicant's application for an adjournment. 7 As mentioned in [1] above, by Application filed on 11 September 2008 the applicant applies to set aside Bankruptcy Notice No NN2786/08. The amount referred to in the Bankruptcy Notice is $4,794.75, being the amount of a judgment obtained by the respondent to the current application in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 27 June 2008. I will say a little more about the subject matter of that judgment later in these Reasons. 8 In the affidavit sworn by the applicant on 11 September 2008 and filed in support of his Application, the sole ground relied upon by the applicant for setting aside the Bankruptcy Notice was that he had a \" counter-claim, set off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount in the Bankruptcy Notice \" which he could not have set up in the original proceedings. The \" original proceedings \" in the present case are the Common Law proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in which the judgment for $4,794.75 was obtained (see Glew v Harrowell of Hunt & Hunt Lawyers [2003] FCA 373 ; (2003) 198 ALR 331 at [3] (p 332)). 9 In handwriting, in par 2 of the applicant's affidavit, the applicant set out the following particulars of that ground: Pinata Pty Ltd paid William James Hamilton an amount of $28000 for conducting its Administration and amount of over $25000 in 1996 for a progress payment to him as a Joint Receiver of the Pinata Pty Ltd and Partners Partnership under a Deed of Dissolution and Appointment of Receivers in which William James Hamilton should be disentitled to receive no remuneration because of his acts of wilful neglect and wilful default under Ch 6.3 of the Deed of Dissolution and Appointment of Receivers. Further details of the acts of wilful neglect and wilful default are set out in the accompanying Notice of Motion filed in the Supreme Court of NSW Equity Division on 1 Aug 06 and its annexed affidavit which is attached or accompanying this Notice to Respondent. 10 The applicant attached to his affidavit a copy of the Notice of Motion referred to in par 2 of his affidavit, being a Notice of Motion filed by him on 1 August 2006 in Supreme Court Proceedings No 3346 of 2001 between Pinata Pty Limited, as plaintiff, and the present respondent, as first defendant (\" the Supreme Court proceedings \"). The other defendant parties to the Supreme Court proceedings, in the order in which they were named in those proceedings, were: Robert Peter Leigo Yvonne Lesley Leigo Geoffrey Naunton Davies Kerrie Joy Davies Neill Robert Leigo Bryce Geoffrey Lyle Killen (the present applicant) 11 The applicant also attached to his affidavit a typed narrative of events of six pages in length which seems to have been accepted by the Supreme Court and allowed by that Court to be used as an affidavit in the Supreme Court proceedings. 12 The claims foreshadowed in this material are claims by the members of a partnership styled \" Pinata Pty Limited and Partners \" (\" the Partnership \") against the respondent for breach of duty in respect of the receivership of the Partnership which commenced in 1996. Whilst the alleged breaches of duty are relatively numerous, they are nonetheless all based upon the same alleged duties. The members of the Partnership were Pinata Pty Limited, the Leigos and the Davies (those individuals being named as the second to sixth defendants in the Supreme Court proceedings). 13 The Supreme Court proceedings had started life as a partnership suit brought by Pinata Pty Limited as a member of the Partnership. The relief sought by Pinata Pty Limited, in its capacity as plaintiff in those proceedings, was a Court-ordered dissolution of the Partnership, the appointment of receivers to the Partnership and its assets and ancillary relief. 14 The applicant has supplemented the material contained in his affidavit sworn on 11 September 2008 with additional affidavit and documentary material. When that material was tendered I deferred ruling upon its admissibility. I indicated to Mr Hamilton, who appears for the respondent, that I was minded to proceed to hear the applicant's Application and to determine the admissibility of the material sought to be tendered by the applicant at the conclusion of the hearing as part of the Reasons for Judgment. Mr Hamilton did not oppose that course and that is the basis upon which I have approached all of the evidence tendered by the applicant. 15 The sole ground relied upon by the applicant as entitling him to the order which he seeks reflects the terms of s 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) (\" the Act \"). That subsection provides that a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy if the debtor fails to comply with the requirements of a valid Bankruptcy Notice or fails to satisfy the Court that he or she has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the judgment debt or sum payable under the final order referred to in the Bankruptcy Notice, as the case may be, being a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand that he or she could not have set up in the action or proceeding in which the judgment or order was obtained. 16 Section 41(7) of the Act contemplates that, if a debtor has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand of the kind referred to in s 40(1)(g) , he or she should make application to the Court to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice on that ground and should do so before the expiration of the time for payment or satisfaction set out in the Notice. 17 The amount referred to in the Bankruptcy Notice in the present case is an amount representing legal costs awarded in favour of the respondent which amount was assessed and quantified at $4,794.75 pursuant to the provisions of the Legal Profession Act 2004 (NSW) and the relevant Supreme Court Rules . 18 Both the applicant and Pinata Pty Limited were ordered to pay the costs of and incidental to a cross-claim styled \" The Third Cross-Claim \" which they had brought against the respondent in the Supreme Court proceedings. That order was made by Young CJ in Eq on 16 August 2007 when his Honour struck out that Cross-Claim. Other orders were made by his Honour on that day. 19 The precise orders which his Honour made were: The Court Orders that: 1. In view of the non compliance with the order for security of costs, if the security for costs is not provided by 31 October 2007, the proceedings are to be dismissed with costs. 2. If the security is provided, the matter can be mentioned before His Honour Justice Young at 9:30am on 15 November 2007. 3. The Third Cross Claim is struck out with costs on the basis that it is outside the limitation period. 20 The claims made by Pinata Pty Limited in the Supreme Court proceedings, in its capacity as plaintiff, were also ultimately dismissed when Pinata Pty Limited failed to put up security for costs as contemplated by par 1 of the Orders made by Young CJ in Eq on 16 August 2007. 21 That dismissal was ordered on 15 November 2007. It had the effect of finally disposing of the Supreme Court proceedings. 22 It is clear from the submissions made by the applicant today that the claim or claims which he believes may be brought against the respondent are all claims which reflect potential causes of action available to legal entities other than the applicant himself. Many of those claims were alluded to (directly or indirectly) in the Third Cross-Claim in the Supreme Court proceedings which Young CJ in Eq struck out on the basis that it had been filed outside the relevant limitation period. 23 The material which the applicant sought to tender before me made very clear that none of the claims which he has in mind reflect a claim by him or a cause of action available to him, but rather constitute potential claims either by Pinata Pty Limited or by companies and perhaps trusts associated with Pinata Pty Limited. 24 In 1996, the respondent to the current Application was appointed joint receiver of the Partnership. At that time, he was also the administrator of Pinata Pty Limited. 25 It is apparent from the allegations made in the Third Cross-Claim in the Supreme Court proceedings that the substance of the claims which the applicant believes might be available to Pinata Pty Limited and perhaps to others associated with it, concern the respondent's performance of his duties as one of the receivers of the Partnership. 26 All of the many documents sought to be tendered by the applicant, in one way or another, insofar as they contain assertions of claims against the respondent, raise allegations against the respondent which are based upon his conduct as one of the receivers of the Partnership. 27 I have asked the applicant whether he can point to any material in the affidavits sought to be read by him or in the documents sought to be tendered by him that might support a claim which he himself (as distinct from some other legal entity) might be able to make against the respondent and he has been unable to point to anything that might support such a claim. Indeed, he goes further. He quite frankly concedes that the claims which he has in mind are claims which can only properly be made by legal entities other than himself. Having read all of the material tendered by the applicant, I agree with the applicant. There was no evidence or material which I could see which would support a claim by the applicant (in his own right) against the respondent. 28 As I mentioned earlier, the order for costs made by Young CJ in Eq was made against both Pinata Pty Limited and the applicant. Both Pinata Pty Limited and the applicant were cross-claimants in the Third Cross-Claim in the Supreme Court proceedings. There does not seem to me to be any basis for the applicant to argue that he should not have been made liable for the costs which his Honour ordered both Pinata Pty Limited and him to pay. In any event, the applicant has not argued before me that he has any basis for challenging that order. He has never appealed from that order or sought to have it set aside. 29 The applicant did submit to me that he ought not to be made liable to pay the sum claimed pursuant to that order, unless and until all avenues of recourse against Pinata Pty Limited have been exhausted. I reject that submission. It is quite clear that both Pinata Pty Limited and the applicant personally were jointly and severally liable under the costs order made by Young CJ in Eq, so that there is no warrant for the respondent, being the party who holds the benefit of that order, being required to pursue Pinata Pty Limited before having recourse to his remedies against the applicant. In any event, Pinata Pty Limited was placed into liquidation by order of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 24 October 2008, so that even if the applicant's point were a good one, the respondent cannot now pursue Pinata Pty Limited without the leave of the Court. There was no evidence as to the current financial position of Pinata Pty Limited. Recovery against Pinata Pty Limited would obviously now be difficult if not impossible. 30 Subsection 40(1)(g) of the Act has been considered in many authorities over the years. A useful summary of the relevant principles is found in the judgment of Lindgren J in Glew [2003] FCA 373 ; 198 ALR 331 at [8] to [12] (333---334). I will not set out in these Reasons for Judgment what his Honour said in those paragraphs but I do accept the statements made by his Honour as correct statements of principle and I propose to apply them in the present case. 31 Before doing so, I will rule on the admissibility of the material tendered by the applicant. 32 Many objections were taken to the material on behalf of the respondent. I should say that most of the objections were well taken. Some concerned the fragmented nature of the material. Some were objections as to form and others were taken on the basis that the material was irrelevant. The respondent's Notice of Objections may be found in the Court file. 33 If I were to take a very strict view of admissibility, I would reject almost all of the material. However, I am of the view that it is necessary for me to receive the material, so that I can fully understand and weigh up the ground relied upon by the applicant in support of his Application. It seems to me that the correct approach to this material is to admit it but to treat it with caution in terms of its weight and relevance. This is the approach which I propose to take. The affidavits and other documents referred to at pages 9 to 12 of the transcript of today's hearing and the documents marked for identification as MFI-1 and MFI-2 will together become Exhibit A. 34 It is not necessary for me to traverse the material in any detail at all. As I have already mentioned, it rises no higher than a series of argumentative assertions and contentions, all of which are designed to demonstrate that the respondent, in a number of different ways and over a period of time, failed properly or adequately to perform the duties, functions and obligations imposed upon him as one of the receivers of the Partnership and is thus liable to some or all of the members of the Partnership for any losses suffered by them by reason of these alleged breaches of duty. 35 The members of the Partnership were Pinata Pty Limited, Robert Peter Leigo, Yvonne Lesley Leigo, Geoffrey Naunton Davies, Kerrie Joy Davies and Neill Robert Leigo. The applicant has informed me that Mr and Mrs Davies are related to the Leigos and I accept that for present purposes. 36 The material also indicates that a company called Castanair Pty Limited, probably in a trust capacity, is currently the sole shareholder of Pinata Pty Limited. 37 The applicant was never personally a member of the Partnership and, on the material before me, does not have any right to make claims against the respondent for allegedly breaching his duties as one of the receivers of the Partnership. 38 The applicant has put to me that he may be able to bring forward a claim on behalf of Pinata Pty Limited or its shareholder Castanair Pty Limited or the beneficiaries of the trust of which Castanair Pty Limited is said to be the trustee. Precisely what claim could be brought forward and how this would be done was not articulated before me. In any event, what seems to be perfectly clear is that, whatever the claim might be and however it might be litigated, it would be for the benefit of one or more of these other entities and would be brought either in the name of one or other of these other entities or by some person appointed for the purpose of bringing the claim for and on behalf of one or other of these other entities. Such a claim would not qualify as a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand upon which the applicant could rely in the present Application. 39 The only conclusion one can reach and the conclusion which I do reach is that the applicant personally has no rights against the respondent. He has been unable to identify any such rights. None were apparent from the evidence which he tendered. The claims which he has in mind being brought against the respondent, even if they can be regarded as having any substance, are all claims which entities other than the applicant must bring. 40 For the above reasons, the applicant has failed to make out the ground upon which he relied in support of his current Application and the Application must be dismissed. 41 The respondent seeks an order for costs against the applicant. The applicant has submitted that there may be some doubt as to whether or not he was personally liable in the fashion that Young CJ in Eq found him to be when his Honour made the original order for costs on 16 August 2007. This is not the occasion or the forum for agitating that point, if indeed it can be agitated at all either now or in the future. The submission made by the applicant does not address any matter that is relevant to the question of whether I should make an order for costs in favour of the respondent against the applicant. In those circumstances, the applicant having wholly failed in his Application, I order that he pay the respondent's costs of this Application, including any reserved costs. I certify that the preceding forty-one (41) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Foster.

It conducted examinations of employees and former employees of AWB and AWBI pursuant to s 19 of the ASIC Act and, in addition, obtained signed witness statements voluntarily from other employees and former employees. Nineteen transcripts of the s 19 examinations and fourteen signed witness statements are in issue in these proceedings (\"the AWB Information\"). 3 In early 2008, ASIC received a request from the Australian Federal Police (\"the AFP\") that it disclose certain information, including the AWB Information, to the AFP. AWB's solicitors learned of the request from a current employee and three former employees who had been examined by ASIC. Those current and former employees had been contacted by ASIC about the AFP request. ASIC informed them that ASIC was considering whether to provide the transcript of their s 19 examination to the AFP and, consistent with the decision of the High Court in Johns v Australian Securities Commission [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408 , provided each of them with an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of the transcript of their s 19 examination to the AFP. 4 Upon learning of the proposed disclosure by ASIC, AWB wrote to ASIC on 1 April 2008 seeking an opportunity to be heard and to make submissions to ASIC in relation to the proposed release of information to the AFP including the conditions of the release. ASIC responded on 11 April 2008. At that time, the request was limited to the transcripts of the s 19 examinations. ASIC outlined the terms of the AFP request, its proposal to release the transcripts of the s 19 examinations to the AFP and the conditions upon which that information was proposed to be released. ASIC expressed the view that: It is ASIC's view that the protocols that were applied during the course of the section 19 ASIC Act examinations to ensure that information subject to a valid claim of legal professional privilege was not disclosed were sufficient, and that no privileged information was disclosed during the course of any examinations. ... Further, in light of the conditions on which ASIC proposes to release the examination transcripts to the AFP, and the secrecy provisions imposed on employees of the AFP by section 60A of the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 Cth [sic], ASIC does not consider that [AWB's] interests in the confidentiality of any information provided to ASIC by examinees will be adversely affected by the proposed release. Although it is ASIC's view that ... [AWB's] interests will [not] be adversely affected by any decision to release the information to the AFP on the limited basis identified in paragraph 5 above, ASIC proposes to give [AWB] an opportunity to make submissions in relation to the conditions to be imposed on the disclosure of the transcripts of examinations of current or former employees of [AWB] to the AFP under section 127(4) of the ASIC Act . 5 ASIC and AWB's solicitors corresponded for some months. By July 2008, the AFP request had extended to disclosure of the witness statements that had been provided voluntarily by the employees and former employees of AWB. 6 In general terms, AWB sought to prevent disclosure of the AWB Information to the AFP to the extent that the AWB Information would disclose a communication which is the subject of AWB's legal professional privilege. AWB did not seek access to the AWB Information. Instead, it suggested two possible solutions to the problem - the appointment of an independent third party to review the AWB Information to ensure that disclosure of the AWB Information would not disclose a communication which is the subject of AWB's legal professional privilege, or, pursuant to s 127(4A) of the ASIC Act , that conditions be attached to the disclosure of the AWB Information to the AFP. The conditions sought by the AWB were: (a) the proposed disclosure should only be made to certain specified officers of the AFP ( AFP Officers ); (b) any information that is the subject of the proposed disclosure must only be used internally by the AFP Officers to assist the AFP to perform or exercise its functions for the purposes of its investigation into possible breaches of Australian law committed by AWB, AWBI and certain individuals; (c) the AFP Officers must not disclose any information that is the subject of the proposed disclosure to any other person, either internally within the AFP or externally outside the AFP, unless the conditions contained in s 127(4) of the ASIC Act are satisfied; (d) AWB must be permitted to make submissions regarding any proposed disclosure by the AFP Officers to any other person; (e) If the AFP is required to disclose the information gained from ASIC by compulsion of law, the AFP must give notice to ASIC and AWB before this information is disclosed; and (f) Any disclosure by the AFP Officers to any other person must be subject to these conditions. 7 On 2 September 2008, a delegate of the Chairperson of ASIC made a decision to authorise the disclosure of the AWB Information to the AFP under s 127(4) of the ASIC Act , subject to certain conditions (\"the Decision\"). The delegate did not adopt either of the solutions proffered by AWB. Instead, the conditions imposed by the delegate pursuant to s 127(4A) were: 4.1 The information is only to be made available to AFP officers who are investigating possible breaches of Australian law committed by [AWB], [AWBI], and certain individuals; 4.2 the information may only be used by the AFP to enable or assist the AFP to perform or exercise its functions for the purposes of its investigation into possible breaches of Australian law committed by [AWB], [AWBI], and certain individuals; 4.3 the information is not to be disclosed voluntarily outside the AFP without the prior written consent of ASIC; 4.4 if the AFP is required to disclose the information by force of law (including by subpoena), the AFP must give prior written notice to ASIC and any party whose interests may be adversely affected by the disclosure; 4.5 each ... transcript that has not been corrected and signed by the relevant examinee is to be given a notation to that effect before release to the AFP. 8 On 11 September 2008, AWB commenced these proceedings to challenge the Decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (\"the ADJR Act \") and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) on the following grounds: 1. constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction and absence of power; 2. error of law; 3. failing to take into account relevant considerations; 4. taking into account irrelevant considerations; 5. denial of natural justice. 9 At the time each of the employees or former employees of AWB were examined under s 19 of the ASIC Act , a set of procedures were agreed between ASIC and AWB for determining claims of legal professional privilege over documents which were required to be produced to ASIC pursuant to a notice issued by ASIC under s 30 of the ASIC Act . The protocol included an acknowledgement that if documents which are the subject of a claim of legal professional privilege by AWB were inadvertently disclosed to ASIC pursuant to the protocol, ASIC acknowledged and agreed that ASIC would not assert that legal professional privilege had been waived by AWB solely by reason of that inadvertent disclosure and any inspection of the documents by ASIC would not have the consequence of waiving legal professional privilege. 10 Of course, AWB was not examined or interviewed. Its former and current employees were the subject of the s 19 examinations. It was for that reason that AWB also sought to attend each of the examinations to protect its legal professional privilege. Prior to the commencement of the examination of an employee of AWB named Sarah Scales, Dr McNicol of Counsel, on behalf of the AWB and AWBI, made the following submissions: [W]e are submitting that [we are] entitled to a limited right of appearance at the section 19 examinations, solely for the purpose of protecting the company's (sic) legally privileged communications. We do not seek a general right of intervention in the examination. What we are seeking is a very limited and narrow right of audience in which we seek to address privilege issues. We are merely wishing to protect AWB[']s privilege, and in particular, any threatened disclosure of privileged communications. [AWB is] seeking to invoke and maintain its legal professional privilege in any material and information that is properly protected by privilege. I have three ... main areas of concern and they are all closely related to one another. ... [We are] concerned about oral disclosures being made by examinees and witnesses which may reveal AWB[']s privileged communications. AWB[']s privilege may be disclosed, albeit unintentionally, insofar as ASIC is concerned. ASIC may not seek to elicit any privileged material but it may nonetheless occur. A situation might arise, for example, where AWB[']s privilege is disclosed in an answer given by a witness to Mr Inspector's question. For example, the witness might volunteer deliberately in the belief that the oral disclosure will be of assistance to that particular witness --- maybe in the belief it will be exculpatory of that witness. Now, the fact that ASIC has generously given the undertaking not to ask and not to intend to ask questions that will elicit answers that may, in turn, disclose privileged communications will not prevent this sort of privileged information being disclosed by the witness. We are aware, and it is true, that individual examinees do not have the power to waive the company's privilege. It's AWB[']s privilege we're here to maintain today. But individual witnesses can inadvertently or deliberately reveal, nonetheless, confidential communication. It's not so much the documents that we're concerned with or all those documents that were ruled upon, for example, by Young J in the Federal Court[;] we're concerned about the possibility of oral answers being given which disclose privileged communications.... That's our first concern, and as I said we have only three main concerns. The second one[,] which is a consequence of the first concern, is that if there is an unauthorised disclosure, and I refer to it as \"unauthorised\" because an individual does not have the capacity or the legal capacity to waive the company's privilege. If, nonetheless, there is an unauthorised disclosure by an individual employee for example, or an examinee of the privileged information, then ASIC will become fixed with knowledge of this privileged information, and it will still be privileged if AWB has not waived it. Now, the consequences of ASIC becoming fixed with such knowledge of privileged material has the potential of compromising the integrity of the investigation. It's difficult to unscramble pieces of privileged information from pieces of non-privileged information. It's difficult to segregate in the corporate mind of ASIC those pieces of information. And there is learning on this --- cases which say that once you are aware and have knowledge of privileged information, you are in a sense tainted with that knowledge and you have that knowledge and you can't build that Chinese wall in your head. Now, there's also the problem of derivative use of that information once ASIC has knowledge of the privileged information. It may be used in --- there will not be a flow-on effect to other information. And I make mention of the Cole Inquiry here where situations were given where individual witnesses revealed privileged information of the company, in the hope for example, that --- or expectation --- that [it] may be exculpatory of them. And unless the company --- AWB, who obviously was present at the Cole Inquiry, unless they objected at that time then the privilege was said to have been lost or waived because of the silent acquiescence of the privilege holder, and that is the company itself. So my second concern, in short, is simply that once disclosed then the AWB[']s privileged communications cannot be ignored or segregated in the corporate mind of ASIC. And this has the potential to undermine the integrity of the examination because the intellectual use of that information will simply remain. And there's another related concern to this --- the derivative [use] point --- and that is that obviously there can be disclosures of written records of section 19 examinations under section 25 of the ASIC Act , and we're concerned about that because given there are several class actions on foot against AWB, that concern that we have is far from hypothetical. And the third concern is this. AWB has a fundamental right to claim privilege and this, we submit, this right does not interfere with the privacy of section 19 examinations. We're aware that examinations are to be conducted in private but we say that that privacy does not extend to preventing the exercise of fundamental common law rights. The privacy of your examinations might exist to protect the interest of examinees or their identity or the integrity of the investigation, but privacy has a particular connotation here. The documents themselves that are used at the examinations can ultimately be released in one way or another and could ultimately be used in evidence. And it's difficult to see how giving the company --- AWB --- a right to assert privilege will interfere with the privacy of the examinations. Most of the Cole information, for example, is publicly known and released and these examinations might be simply conducted with a view to swearing up some of those statements and that information that's already publicly known form the Cole Inquiry. So, our third concern is simply that it's fundamental that the company --- AWB --- as the privilege holder has a right to have an adequate opportunity to claim legal professional privilege in respect of its own privileged communication. Now adequate opportunity is a phrase that's used in the learning and it has been said \"What is an adequate opportunity will depend on the facts of a particular case. \" But if there's an adequate opportunity it must be conferred on privilege holders to assert and invoke their privilege. We are aware that, through your email of 4 October 2007, that you said that you will be notifying --- you ASIC --- will be notifying witnesses at the commencement of the interviews, they're not obliged to disclose communications over which they or a third party may claim legal professional privilege. Well, you also have given a concession that you will not intend to ask questions that elicit answers that may disclose privileged communications. And you have said that in circumstances where a witness discloses a privileged communication, ASIC does not intend to ask the examinee to disclose the substance of that communication. Our submission is that these concessions are helpful but they do not go far enough to ensure that the company's privilege is and will be protected. There must be a specific invocation of privilege --- legal professional privilege --- privilege is personal to the holder of the privilege and the privilege may either be invoked or waived. And only the holder of the privilege may waive the privilege. And in the event of waiver, the communication that is otherwise privileged, will be released or disclosed. And the fact that ASIC will be notifying the examines and the witnesses that they're not obliged to disclose communications over which a third party --- and in this case AWB being the third party --- may have a claim to privilege, is not sufficient to protect the privilege of that party. Any my final point is simply this. This is a context where the ordinary concerns of confidentiality in the examinations have to some extent, at least, been eroded by the fact that much of what is being addressed in these examinations has already been canvassed at the public hearing of the Cole Inquiry. And we note that in, for example, the section 19 notice to Sarah Scales this morning, you have asked [her] to refresh her memory from statements that she gave to the Cole Inquiry in December 2005 in her addendum statement in February 2006, and her ... oral evidence that she gave to the Enquiry in February 2006. And those are my submission[s], and thank you for the opportunity to present them. 11 The ASIC investigator responded to the submissions, in part, in the following terms: I'll confirm that at the preamble to the examinations that we'll be conducting. We'll be confirming to witnesses that they are --- in answer to any question --- they are not obliged to disclose communication[s] over which they or a third party may have a claim for legal professional privilege. We will also embark upon a description that if they wish to refuse to answer a question on the basis that to do so would disclose communication that may be the subject of claim for legal professional privilege, then they will be asked to provide the following information: (1) A description as to the general nature of communication. (2) To whom and by whom it was made. (3) The circumstances in which it was made. (4) Whether any obligation of confidentiality was imposed at the time of the communication, and if so, how. (5) The name of the party who may have a claim for privilege, and (6) An explanation of the grounds upon which they believe that the claim may be made. 12 After adjourning to take advice on the submissions, the investigator returned and said that he was not prepared to permit AWB to be represented at the examination of Ms Scales and therefore would not make a direction under the ASIC Act for such representation. The investigator was not prepared to issue reasons. After the investigator restated the six points identified in [11] above, the following exchange occurred: DR McNICOL: Thank you. Mr Inspector. I only just have one final question and that is, is it contemplated that --- I think it was the penultimate point number 5 --- where it was identified that the name of the person who may have a claim to privilege --- can assert the privilege --- is it contemplated that that person --- examinee --- can claim the privilege on behalf of the company? MR CARIDI: [T]he only party to whom a claim for legal professional privilege can make that claim is the holder themselves. In a situation such as this where ... Sarah Scales may consider that a third party might have a claim, one would envisage that that may well be AWB. And so in an answer to that question, one would imagine that she would venture the answer --- AWB would be the holder of the privilege. DR McNICOL: So it is contemplated that examinees can claim the privilege on behalf of the company? MR CARIDI: No, they're not entitled to make the claim. They can say that another party may have a claim and may make a claim, and if they do ASIC will proceed accordingly in the way that I have described. ... MR CARIDI: Neither they could make the claim nor they can waive the claim as you have most rightly pointed out. ISSUE 13 ASIC did not permit AWB or AWBI to protect any of its privileged communications from being inadvertently or deliberately disclosed by the examinees during the course of the s 19 examinations. Moreover, none of these arrangements was expressly said to apply when ASIC voluntarily obtained a witness statement from some of AWB's employees or former employees. In those circumstances, was ASIC required to consider whether passing the AWB Information to the AFP would disclose a communication which might be the subject of AWB's legal professional privilege? For the reasons that follow, the answer to that question is no. LEGISLATION AND ANALYSIS 14 The decision by ASIC to disclose the AWB Information to the AFP was made under s 127(4) of the ASIC Act . Section 127 of the ASIC Act entitled \"Confidentiality\" provides, so far as is relevant, that: (1) ASIC must take all reasonable measures to protect from unauthorised use or disclosure information: (a) given to it in confidence in or in connection with the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers under the corporations legislation (other than the excluded provisions); or (b) that is protected information. ... (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the disclosure of information as required or permitted by a law of the Commonwealth or a prescribed law of a State or internal Territory is taken to be authorised use and disclosure of the information. ... (4) Where the Chairperson is satisfied that particular information: (a) will enable or assist ... any other agency within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 , to perform or exercise any of the agency's functions or powers; ... ... the disclosure of the information to the agency ... by a person whom the Chairperson authorises for the purpose is taken to be authorised use and disclosure of the information. (4A) The Chairperson may impose conditions to be complied with in relation to information disclosed under subsection (4). ... (4E) A person must not intentionally or recklessly fail to comply with a condition imposed under subsection (4D). ... (Emphasis added. ) 15 The following matters are not in dispute. The AFP is an \"agency\" within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (s 127(4)(a) of the ASIC Act ) and the AWB Information is \"information\" for the purposes of s 127 of the ASIC Act . 16 It was also not contended by either side that a different analysis or result should obtain under s 127 of the ASIC Act for the transcripts of the s 19 interviews as opposed to the voluntarily obtained witness statements. This is not surprising; as s 127(1) makes clear, the section applies equally not only to information obtained in connection with its powers and functions under the corporations legislation but also to information \"given to it in confidence\" and obtained \"in connection with the performance of its functions. \" There was no suggestion here that the 14 witness statements were given to ASIC otherwise than in confidence and in connection with the performance of its functions (here, the s 13 investigation). Both because the issue (ie whether a different analysis or result was required for the witness statements) was not raised by the parties and because I am independently satisfied that no different analysis or result is required, I need not and do not distinguish between the transcripts and witness statements for purposes of the following analysis. 17 The issue which lies at the heart of the dispute between ASIC and AWB concerns what occurs if an examinee or witness inadvertently, or deliberately, discloses material in which AWB claims privilege when AWB has not been provided with an opportunity to protect its privilege and ASIC is then requested to disclose the information (including the privileged communications) under s 127(4) of the ASIC Act . 18 Section 127(1) of the ASIC Act imposes an obligation on ASIC to take all reasonable measures to protect the unauthorised use or disclosure of information given to it in confidence in performance of its functions: Onefone Australia Pty Ltd v One.Tel Ltd [2007] NSWSC 1188 at [7] . Section 127(4) provides an exception to that general principle. Where ASIC is satisfied \"particular information\" will assist, for example, the AFP, then disclosure of that \"particular information\" to the AFP will be taken to be an authorised use and disclosure of that \"particular information\". 19 The exercise of the power under s 127(4) of the ASIC Act is the exercise of an additional power in relation to the \"particular information\" identified by ASIC at the time of the request by the AFP. It necessarily will involve consideration of \"information\" that did not exist at the time of the examination (here, the questions and answers recorded in the transcript) or the taking of the witness statement (here, the statement). It will also necessarily involve the consideration of matters that did not exist at the aforementioned times, including the nature of the agency function or power (here, criminal investigation by the AFP) and the usefulness of the information to that exercise of power (here, the conduct of that investigation). Section 127(4A) of the ASIC Act provides that ASIC may impose conditions in relation to disclosure of the \"particular information\" under s 127(4). The conditions imposed by ASIC in respect of the AWB Information are those set out in [7] above. 20 In the present case, the dispositive issue (see [13] above) has two aspects to it. The two aspects to consider are: 1. whether, in exercising the power under s 127(4) , by deciding to pass the AWB Information to the AFP, ASIC failed to consider a relevant matter; and 2. a more basic question of power. For reasons which will become obvious, it is first necessary to deal with the question of power. SECOND LIMB: QUESTION OF POWER 21 There is no factual foundation yet established that there is material in the AWB Information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches. However, if the AWB Information does contain information to which the legal professional privilege of AWB attaches, ASIC would have power to pass on that material to the AFP. That conclusion requires development. 22 It is settled that \"legal professional privilege is a rule of substantive law which may be availed of by a person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents which would reveal communications between a client or his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services\": Daniels Corporation International Pty Ltd v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 at [9] and [11] and the authorities cited. 23 In the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, legal professional privilege may be availed of to resist the giving of information or the production of documents in accordance with investigatory procedures of the kind contained in s 155 of the Trade Practices Act 1975 (Cth) (\"the TPA\"): Daniels Corporation [2002] HCA 49 ; 213 CLR 543 at [10] and [11]. Despite differences in language between the TPA and the ASIC Act , no different result ensues. There is no express provision in the ASIC Act abrogating legal professional privilege. Moreover, there is nothing in the ASIC Act supporting the contention that the abrogation of legal professional privilege is a necessary implication: see eg ss 1(1) , 1 (2), 1 (3), Pt 3 and, in particular, ss 68 and 69 . 24 In the course of argument, ASIC appeared to suggest there were qualifications to the general proposition that the ASIC Act did not abrogate legal professional privilege. The qualifications were, first, that the ASIC Act is silent as to whether a person other than a lawyer may refuse to give information on the ground that it would disclose a communication for which the person claims legal privilege. If that observation by ASIC was intended to provide support for a contention that an individual, not a lawyer, could be compelled by ASIC to disclose information for which the individual had a claim for legal professional privilege, then that contention is rejected. It is rejected because it finds no support in the Act and is contrary to authority ( Daniels ). There is no basis for distinguishing between a lawyer and an individual in the context of legal professional privilege. So much is made clear from the express words of s 69 of the ASIC Act . In the circumstances specified (which includes ASIC's powers of investigation, examination and information gathering in Pt 3) , a lawyer may refuse to comply with a requirement to give information or produce a book, where to do so would involve the disclosure of a privileged communication with the lawyer in their capacity as a lawyer \" unless ... the person to whom, or by or on behalf of whom, the communication was made consents to the lawyer complying with the requirement\" (emphasis added): s 69(2). In other words, consistent with authority, the section proceeds on the premise that the holder of the privilege (being the client regardless of whether the client is an individual or a body corporate) must consent to the disclosure of the privilege it holds. No other party is able to waive the privilege; it is the holder of the privilege (the client) that must act inconsistently with the maintenance of that privilege for privilege to be waived: see Cadbury Schweppes Pty Ltd v Amcor Ltd (2008) 246 ALR 137 at [17]. Any other result is contrary to the fundamental principles summarised in [21] and [22] above. 25 That then brings me to the second of ASIC's suggested qualifications - that even if the ASIC Act does not abrogate legal professional privilege, the privilege rises no higher than that ASIC cannot compel a person, subject to a s 19 notice to attend for examination, from disclosing his or her own privileged information. That contention requires closer examination. 26 On the assumption that, at the outset of a s 19 examination, ASIC told an examinee that legal professional privilege may be availed of by that person to resist the giving of information or the production of documents that would reveal communications between a client and his or her lawyer made for the dominant purpose of giving or obtaining legal advice or the provision of legal services, then disclosure by an examinee or witness of information in which he or she holds the privilege would constitute an act inconsistent with the maintenance of that privilege and privilege would be waived: see Cadbury 246 ALR 137 at [13]. So much may be accepted. It is consistent with the established principles on waiver. 27 If ASIC's submission is intended to suggest that if that same person (for example, an employee, director, consultant to, but not a legal adviser of, a third party) was privy to the privileged communications of the third party, then ASIC could compel production of that privileged information, that contention should be rejected for the reasons outlined in [21] and [22] above. 28 If, however, ASIC meant to submit not that it could compel a person (here, an employee or former employee) to disclose a third party's (here, a company's) privilege by force of statute, but rather that the person may lack the standing to assert the third party's privilege, then that contention may be accepted. Just as an employee can only waive a corporation's privilege if he or she has authority to do so (typically, where the person is a current officer or director), so too may an employee only assert a claim of privilege belonging to a corporation if he or she has the requisite authority: Commodity Futures Trading Commission v Weintraub [1985] USSC 102 ; 471 US 343 , 348-49 (1985); In re Grand Jury Proceedings [2006] USCA1 234 ; 469 F3d 24 (1 st Cir 2006); Wrench LLC v Taco Bell Corporation 212 FRD 514 , 517 (WD Mich 2002) (collecting cases); see also S McNicol, Law of Privilege (1992) at 161-62 (citing Rochfort v Trade Practices Commission (1982) 153 CLR 134 for the proposition that an employee cannot assert the privilege of self-incrimination on behalf of a corporation [at that time corporations were still thought to have such a privilege] because the privilege is personal to the holder). To put it another way, the ASIC investigator was legally correct when he told counsel for AWB that \"[n]either ... could [the employees] make the claim [of privilege on behalf of AWB] nor [could they] waive the claim...\": [12] above. 29 In other words, I accept the contention that although ASIC cannot compel the production of legally privileged communications of a person (ie the ASIC Act does not override or abrogate legal professional privilege), that does not mean that ASIC cannot receive such communications under any circumstances. As ASIC contended, legal professional privilege affords a person immunity from compulsory disclosure of its privileged communication ( Daniels ). That immunity does not prevent receipt by ASIC in the circumstances of the present case of legally privileged information from the examinees and the witnesses where they were not the holder of the privilege. 30 That conclusion sounds, at least at first blush, as harsh or unjust. Even Mason J, in holding that an employee could not claim privilege against self-incrimination on behalf of his or her corporate employer in order to resist a subpoena, accepted that ( Rochfort at 145): To acknowledge that the employee's possession [of privileged information] is sufficient in itself to sustain an obligation to produce, without reference to his employer, would be to disregard the employer's rights with respect to his documents. What is more it would deprive him of the privilege of objecting to produce a document on the ground that it has a tendency to incriminate him. However, closer examination reveals both why this result is not as harsh as it first seems and why it is necessary. 31 First, although the examination under s 19 of the ASIC Act is private, it is an examination where \"the inspector may give directions about who may be present during it, or during a part of it\": s 22(1). If a direction is made for a person to attend, that person is entitled to attend the examination: s 22(2). The \"person\" referred to in s 22 is not the examinee's lawyer. The right of the examinee's lawyer to attend and address the inspector is separately and expressly provided for in s 23. Who then could that person be? One obvious contender is the legal adviser of the examinee's employer in circumstances such as those outlined in the extracts of the transcript (see [10] above). But ASIC did not permit that to occur. The power to make directions must include directions not only about the identity of the legal representative who might be entitled to attend on behalf of the company at any examination, but also about the non-disclosure of the contents of the examination to any person or entity (including the entity seeking to protect its privileged communications). 32 Of course, there cannot be a general rule that a legal representative of the employer or the former employer of the examinee should be permitted to attend to protect the employer's privilege. There may well be circumstances where to do so would jeopardise the investigation: see eg Gangemi v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCA 494 ; (2003) 129 FCR 284 at [35] , [38]; see also Rochfort at 145 (Mason J) (stating that request for the production of privileged information should generally be directed to the employer but \"the protection of the employer's interests [in the information] must give way to the public interest in the efficient administration of justice in case of collision between the two\"). But in the absence of such a circumstance, the voluntary grant by ASIC of a limited right to be present in the manner outlined by counsel for AWB might have forestalled the issues raised in these proceedings. 33 However, neither AWB nor AWBI took any step to review the decision of the investigator to refuse to permit AWB to be represented at the examinations. Whether such an effort would have succeeded seems unlikely (see [36]-[37] below); in this regard, it is illuminating to examine United States v Western Electric Corp Inc 1990-1 Trade Cases |P 68,939; 1990 WL 39129 at *1 (DDC 1990) (stating that the company had no right to have its own counsel present, whether in addition to or in lieu of individual counsel, at examinations of present or former employees because that \"would be an obvious prescription for frustrating investigations into wrongdoing\"). 34 However that may be, the fact of the matter is that ASIC now has possession of information which, at least in theory, could be subject to a valid claim of privilege by AWB. The question then is whether ASIC is entitled to make use of that information, notwithstanding the possible privilege claim, and the answer to that question is yes. As the Court of Appeal in Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 said (at [32]): [A]lthough it is now accepted that legal professional privilege is more than just a rule of evidence or procedure, it is clear that it is not to be characterised as a rule of law conferring individual rights sounding in damages or an injunction to restrain an apprehended or continued breach [ Commissioner of Australian Federal Police v Propend Finance Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 565 (Gummow J)]. Consequently, once information in a privileged document has come into the hands of a party to litigation, even as a result of compulsive process which is later reversed, the fact that the document was and remains privileged does not of itself prevent that party from making use of the information [ Calcraft v Guest [1898] 1 QB 759, 763-4; Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39 ; (1983) 153 CLR 52 (Gibbs CJ, in diss ), 67, 80 (Mason J, in diss ) 101, 109-110 (Brennan J in diss ), 129 (Dawson J); Trevorrow v State of South Australia (No 4) (2006) 94 SASR 64 , 70 (Doyle CJ), 80 (Debelle J), 101 (White J); Heydon, Cross on Evidence , 7 th Aust Ed (2004) [25025]. 35 Secondly, a government agency or authority (such as ASIC) in the exercise of its compulsory powers must provide the person the subject of the exercise of the power with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on his or her own behalf: see Federal Commissioner of Taxation v Citibank Ltd (1989) 20 FCR 403 , 414 and MM v Australian Crime Commission (2007) 244 ALR 452 at [35]-[36]; but see JMA Accounting Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 274 ; (2004) 139 FCR 537 at [10] - [13] . Given the arrangements put in place by ASIC (see [9], [11] above), there was no (and could be no) complaint that the examinees were not provided with a reasonable opportunity to claim legal professional privilege on their own behalf. 36 I should also note that examinees were even given an opportunity to raise an issue as to a possible third-party privilege. No doubt this is the best policy, but whether it was required as a matter of law may be doubted: see Rochfort at 145-47 (noting that in general effort should be made to respect potential interests of the third-party lawyer but that there are various circumstances where the interests of justice will trump protection of those interests). In MM , Emmett J held that a person must be given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of others as well as himself or herself. In support of this proposition, his Honour relied on the Full Court's decision in Citibank ; however, that decision was disapproved by the later Full Court decision in JMA . Moreover, the conclusion in MM rested on a premise which may be in doubt. Emmett J reasoned (at [35]) that an examinee \"would be obliged to make claims for privilege in respect of documents where the privilege might reasonably be expected to exist in order to ensure that such a claim for privilege would not be lost . \" (Emphasis added. ) In other words, his Honour found that the obligation to make a claim on behalf of others must exist in order to prevent waiver. However, as I have already noted, and as the parties in this case recognised from the start, only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Thus there is no possibility that the failure of an employee to claim privilege on behalf of the corporation would result in waiver or loss of the privilege (except perhaps where the employee is authorised to waive the privilege). To the contrary, it is precisely if a general duty to claim the privilege is imposed that a risk of waiver arises - that is, imagine that an employee under a duty was given a reasonable opportunity to claim privilege on behalf of the employer but failed to do so; under Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66 ; (1999) 201 CLR 1 that would be conduct inconsistent with the maintenance of the privilege and would mean that any employee, without the knowledge or authority of the corporate employer, could waive the corporation's privilege. For those reasons, it does not seem either necessary or wise to impose a general obligation on an examinee to claim privilege on behalf of a third party, nor to create a general obligation on behalf of the examiner to give the examinee a reasonable opportunity to make such a claim. While an employee may have an obligation in contract or equity to maintain the confidences of his or her employer ( NP Generations Pty Ltd v Feneley (2001) 80 SASR 151 at [16]-[19]), that cannot be converted into an ability to control the exercise of the employer's legal professional privilege. 37 But while there may be a question as to what obligations or abilities a person may have in respect of claims of privilege on behalf of third parties, it is clear that there is no requirement in the ASIC Act , which imposes an obligation on ASIC to afford a person or entity (other than the person the subject of the exercise of the compulsory power) (ie the third party itself): 1. an opportunity to intervene or interject in the exercise of the compulsory power over another in order to claim or assert legal professional privilege on behalf of itself: see, in particular Pts 3 and 7 of the ASIC Act ; or 2. notice that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual (such as an examinee) may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party. See by way of example, May v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1999] FCA 287 ; (1999) 92 FCR 152 at [31] , [36] and [38] and MM at [36] and [37]. 38 That is not surprising. If ASIC were under an obligation to notify a third party that the exercise of its compulsory power in relation to another individual (such as an examinee) may result in that individual providing information that is subject to a claim of legal professional privilege by that third party, by what criteria would ASIC determine when and in what circumstances it was required to notify a third party? Would ASIC be required to interrupt an examination upon becoming aware of the prospect of or the fact of information being provided by an examinee which might be the subject of a claim of privilege by a third party? How would ASIC determine if it was properly subject to a claim for legal professional privilege? The list of difficulties is endless and the possibility great that efficient and timely investigation of wrongdoing would be frustrated. 39 Moreover, there are measures that the third party can take to prevent disclosure of its privileged information even in the absence of a right to intervene. First, where an examinee is subject to the exercise of compulsory powers by a government authority and in possession of privileged information where the holder of the privilege is a third party, it is open to the holder of privilege to require or authorise the examinee to assert the holder's privilege to the authority: MM at [33] (cf s 122(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth)). Of course, the efficacy of this strategy is likely to be limited in situations where the third party does not have prior notice of the examination or other exercise of power over another under the ASIC Act . 40 Secondly, equity may restrain use of confidential information improperly obtained , especially where the information is used as a \"springboard for a claim or defence in litigation\": Cowell v British American Tobacco Australia Services Ltd [2007] VSCA 301 at [15] - [17] . As Emmett J noted in MM , there is nothing to prevent the holder of a claim for privilege making a privilege claim prior to the tendering of evidence against the holder of any information obtained by ASIC in circumstances not giving rise to a waiver: eg ss 76 - 83 of the ASIC Act ; ss 118 and 122 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) and British Coal Corporation v Dennis Rye Ltd (No 2) [1988] 3 All ER 816. Put another way, \"the right of the holder of the privilege not to have privileged material used in evidence against him or her [or it]\" is not affected by the disclosure of the privileged material by a party within the scope of the privilege but not entitled to control its exercise: MM at [38]. This is a natural consequence of the basic principle that only the holder of the privilege may waive it. Moreover, although not applicable in the present case (because the third party here is a corporation, which has no privilege against self-incrimination: Daniels at [31]), that preservation of privilege extends not only to legal professional privilege but also privilege against self-incrimination because the ASIC Act abrogates privilege against self-incrimination (s 68(1)) and then provides a \"use immunity\" to the examinee in relation to information obtained in a s 19 examination where the requirements of s 68(2) are satisfied: s 68(3) of the ASIC Act . Interestingly, unlike other Commonwealth legislation, the \"use immunity\" in the ASIC Act only applies to persons in relation to the making of an oral statement or the signing of a record and not to the production of documents: s 76(1)(d) of the ASIC Act ; see also Privilege in Perspective , ALRC Report No 107 (2007) at Ch 7 and in particular, paras [7.65] --- [7.69] and [7.103] and [7.104]. 41 Against that background, it is necessary to turn to consider s 127 of the ASIC Act . FIRST LIMB: POWER UNDER S 127(4) 42 It is well established that \"an administrative decision may be impugned if the decision maker was bound to take a factor into account in reaching his or her decision but failed to do so\": MM at [40]. If a statute states expressly the factors that must be taken into account that will be decisive. However, if the relevant factors are not expressly stated, they must be determined by necessary implication from the subject matter, scope and purpose of the Act: Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40 ; (1985) 162 CLR 24 , 39-40; Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 , 347-348. 43 As noted earlier, in the present case the question does not centre upon ASIC's power to compel the examinee to reveal anything; it turns upon the proper construction of ASIC's separate and distinct power to pass on what, by hypothesis, is privileged information. The relevant power is found in s 127 of the ASIC Act . Two questions arise: what does s 127 provide and, in particular, does it state expressly the factors that must be taken into account by the decision maker in deciding under s 127(4) \"that particular information ... will enable or assist ... [the AFP] ... to perform or exercise any of the agency's functions or powers\". 44 Section 127 is set out above (see [14]). Subject to ss (2) to (4), it protects the confidentiality of information to which it applies. Subsection (4) is the relevant section. It provides that the delegate of the Chairperson must consider whether the \"particular information\" will enable or assist the AFP to perform or exercise of its functions or powers. Although there was some dispute in the present case about the purpose of ASIC's investigation, the AWB did not suggest that the release by ASIC to the AFP of the AWB Information was for any purpose other than to enable or assist the AFP to perform or exercise its functions or powers: s 127(4). 45 However, that is not the end of the enquiry. The disclosure of the AWB Information by ASIC to the AFP was subject to conditions imposed under s 127(4A) (see [7] above). ASIC's s 127 power to disclose is discretionary: Johns at 428 and 469. The conditions are important. When, as here, conditions are imposed they are enforceable as an equitable obligation. The AFP is affected by the terms on which it received the AWB Information: Johns at 429. The obligation (expressed as a condition) is enforceable, at least, by injunction: Johns at 429. 46 The question which then arises is whether the disclosure of the AWB Information under s 127(4) requires ASIC to observe procedural fairness not only towards the examinee but also a party in the position of AWB consistent with the principles set out in Johns v ASC [1993] HCA 56 ; (1993) 178 CLR 408. The exercise of the statutory power is conditional upon the observance of the rules of natural justice ( Johns at 470; Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10 ; (1992) 175 CLR 564 , 591 and Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 , 598), but does that natural justice requirement extend to AWB? 47 First, it must be recalled that the AWB Information was protected by disclosure (s 127(1)) subject to the qualifications prescribed in ss (2)-(4). That antecedent right or duty is not determinative. However, it is a relevant factor affecting the exercise by ASIC of its discretionary statutory power to disclose the AWB Information to the AFP. Exercise of the authority conferred by s 127(4) was \"apt to affect adversely\" the interests of the examinees who are prima facie entitled to have the transcripts kept confidential: Johns at 430. It was for that reason, consistent with Johns , that ASIC observed the rules of natural justice and informed each of the examinees that it proposed to disclose the transcripts and gave each examinee an opportunity to oppose: Johns at 430-431. 48 The present case, however, concerns not the examinee but AWB, the employer or previous employer of each examinee. In Johns , McHugh J said (at 472) that \"the need to preserve the confidentiality of ASIC's investigation does not exclude procedural fairness, but reduces its content, perhaps in some circumstances to nothing\". Here, the question of whether or not ASIC was obliged to observe the rules of natural justice in the case of AWB did not arise. Although AWB was not told by ASIC of the proposed disclosures to the AFP, it learned of that fact, was \"given the opportunity to put submissions before [ASIC] relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by [ASIC]\" ( Johns at 472) and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure. AWB might have persuaded ASIC to accept or adopt its submissions. It did not. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to pursue McHugh J's observation to its end to determine precisely how much the content of procedural fairness may have been reduced with respect to AWB; I need only find (and do find) that the opportunity to be heard that was given to AWB was sufficient. CONCLUSIONS 49 It follows from what I have just said that none of AWB's grounds of review is made out. The specific grounds are disposed of as follows. Constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction and absence of power - ss 5(1)(c) and (d) of the ADJR Act 50 There was no and could be no constructive failure to exercise jurisdiction or an absence of power contrary to ss 5(1)(c) and (d) of the ADJR Act . AWB's contentions that ASIC was \"[not] empowered by the ASIC Act to obtain confidential and privileged communications from persons other than the holder of the privilege in circumstances where the holder has not expressly or by implication waived the privilege\" is too broad a proposition. ASIC is not empowered to compel production from the privilege-holder and did not do so. 51 However, as noted earlier, although ASIC cannot directly compel the production of legally privileged communications, that does not mean that ASIC cannot receive such communications otherwise than through compulsion of the privilege-holder. Moreover, s 127(4) expressly confers power upon ASIC to disclose information properly obtained to third parties. Error of law and failure to take into account relevant considerations - ss 5(1)(e) , (f) and (j) of the ADJR Act 52 AWB's contentions that the conduct of the delegate constituted a breach of s 5(1)(e) of the ADJR Act is also rejected. The contentions proceed on a factual misconception that the delegate did not inspect the AWB Information. The delegate did (see [14] of the Decision). Moreover, the allegations that the delegate failed to consider whether the act of disclosure by ASIC to the AFP constituted a use of confidential and legally privileged communications and would destroy the confidentiality that AWB was entitled to maintain assume that it was necessary for ASIC to consider those matters. With respect to the first matter (use of confidential and privileged information), it was not necessary for ASIC to do so because, as noted earlier, \"the fact that the [communication] was and remains privileged does not of itself prevent [a party] from making use of that document\": see [33] above. With respect to whether confidentiality would be destroyed, the delegate carefully considered that issue and imposed conditions on the disclosure to the AFP designed to preserve confidentiality and limit any further disclosure or use of the information. In this connection, it is also important to reiterate that because any privilege belonging to AWB still exists and has not been waived, it is still open to AWB to oppose, on the ground of legal professional privilege, the use against it in any legal proceeding of the AWB Information. Taking into account irrelevant considerations --- s 5(1)(e) of the ADJR Act 53 This contention proceeded on the assumption that the conditions imposed by ASIC under s 127(4) \"fall short of protecting the rights which AWB had not been given the opportunity to assert against ASIC\". AWB's \"rights\" were to prevent the inadvertent or deliberate disclosure of privileged information which may have been included in the AWB Information. For the reasons explained above (see [30] to [37] above), there was no obligation on ASIC to provide AWB with any opportunity to protect those \"rights\" in the first instance (ie the right to be present at the examinations or otherwise interject privilege objections), and in any event, AWB did not challenge ASIC's decision to exclude it from the information-gathering process. ASIC obtained the information other than by compulsion of the privilege-holder. It is entitled to use it. AWB is still entitled to protect its rights in the manner described above (see [38] to [39]). Denial of natural justice - s 5(1)(a) of the ADJR Act 54 AWB contended that it was not given an opportunity to be heard on the \"balance\" between the need for protection of AWB's privilege and the need for an efficient and timely investigation, which the delegate considered relevant to the Decision, or on whether the conditions imposed by the delegate would protect against further undermining of the confidentiality in any privileged communications. 55 In my view, there was no denial of natural justice. AWB was \"given the opportunity to put submissions before [ASIC] relating to matters requiring the non-disclosure of information by [ASIC]\" ( Johns at 472) and took advantage of that opportunity by making numerous submissions opposing the disclosure. As I have found, this opportunity to be heard was enough to satisfy any requirements of natural justice in the circumstances: see [47] above. Moreover, it is of the utmost importance to recall that in a proceeding of this nature it is neither necessary nor right to decide the merits of the decision. 56 For those reasons, I would dismiss the application and order the applicant to pay the respondent's costs to be taxed in default of agreement.

FACTUAL SETTING As a matter of convenience, I will adopt with some adaptation the Statement of Facts provided by the respondent Secretary. By decision dated 20 th May 2008 the Respondent determined to cancel the Applicant's Carer Payment from 7 th May 2008, and to raise a debt of $91,396.50 in relation to the Applicant's previously paid Carer Payment, Austudy and Newstart Allowance payments. All such payments were made under, and in accordance with, provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). The decision to cancel the Applicant's Carer Payment was based on the Applicant's failure, without reasonable excuse, to provide documents and information to the Respondent as required by various notices sent to the Applicant in January 2008 and April 2008 regarding his income and assets between 1999 and 2007. The Applicant sought review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) of the decision. By decision dated 8 th August 2008 the SSAT set aside the decision of 20 th May 2008 and substituted a decision that: (i) the Applicant's Carer Payment be suspended rather than cancelled from 7 th May 2008; and (ii) the Respondent further consider the raising of the debt and the amount of any such debt in accordance with certain directions of the SSAT. The Applicant applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of the decision of the SSAT dated 8 August 2008. By decision dated 18 th March 2009 the Tribunal affirmed the decision of the SSAT (the suspension of the Applicant's Carer Payment), and directed that the decision to raise and recover debt against the Applicant be referred back to the Respondent for reconsideration in light of the further information provided at the hearing. By decision dated 10 th August 2009, and having considered the material provided in the course of the Tribunal hearing, the Respondent cancelled the Applicant's Carer Payment and affirmed the earlier decision to raise and recover the said debt. By further amended application to the Court filed on 19 th August 2009 the Applicant sought orders, inter alia, that the Respondent's decision of 10 th August 2009 be quashed, and that the Respondent make a decision as the Applicant's entitlements according to law. On 26 th November 2009 the Respondent made a fresh decision setting aside the decision of 10 th August 2009. The decision of 26 November 2009 determined that: (i) the Applicant's Carer Payment would revert to being suspended in accordance with the decision of the Tribunal of 18 March 2009; (ii) the original debt of $91,396.50 at this time no longer existed; and (iii) any monies recovered from the Applicant in respect of the debt would be reimbursed. The Applicant's failure to provide the Respondent with information and documents sought by the Respondent in the various notices of January and April 2008, it is said, continues. STATUTORY SETTING In form the application before me has been cast as for judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1975 (Cth) and a further amended application has been foreshadowed to deal with the 26 November 2009 decision. The actual issue before the Court turns first and foremost on provisions of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 (Cth). Section 63 of the Act enumerates the various powers of Centrelink to require information from a benefits recipient. Insofar as presently relevant, that section provides: 63 Requirements to attend Department etc. (1) This section applies to a person if: (a) the person is receiving, or has made a claim for, a social security payment; or ... (2) If the Secretary is of the opinion that a person to whom this section applied should: ... (d) give information to the Secretary; the Secretary may notify the person that he or she is required, within a specified time, to: ... (h) give that information; as the case may be. (4) If: (a) a person is receiving, or has made a claim for, a social security payment; and (b) the Secretary notifies the person under subsection (2); and (c) the requirement of the notice is reasonable; and (d) the person does not comply with the requirement; the payment that the person is receiving or has claimed is not payable. Section 80(1) of the Act in turn provides: 80 Cancellation or suspension determination (1) If the Secretary is satisfied that a social security payment is being, or has been, paid to a person: (a) who is not, or was not, qualified for the payment; or (b) to whom the payment is not, or was not, payable; the Secretary is to determine that the payment is to be cancelled or suspended. Additional to the above two provisions are a further two which are more general in character. Section 192 confers a general power on Centrelink to require a person to supply information and s 81(1) gives the Secretary a power to cancel or suspend payment to a person who has not complied with a notice which, inter alia, has been given under s 192. The point I would emphasise in this contrast is the discretion given under s 80(1) requires either cancellation or suspension of a social security payment while s 81(1) provides a discretion to cancel or suspend. As noted in the factual outline, Mr Cosenza received notices requesting information on 7 January 2008 and 30 April 2008. The Tribunal was satisfied that each of the notices was a valid one under s 63 of the Act: see Reasons of 18 March 2009, [19]. While the Tribunal was satisfied that Mr Cosenza made a response to the best of his ability to the 7 January 2008 notice, it found that he did not give all the information required in the 30 April 2008 notice within the time specified in them: Reasons [20]. In the Tribunal's view he did not have a reasonable excuse within the meaning of s 63(9) of the Act for not complying with the notices issued on 30 April 2008: Reasons [20]. I should indicate, though it is not strictly relevant given the circumstances of this matter, that s 85 of the Act makes express provision for reconsideration by the Secretary of a decision to cancel or suspend which can lead to a determination that a social security payment was now payable. The obvious premise of this provision is that the Secretary on the reconsideration decision is possessed of such information as can provide the relevant level of satisfaction. The final statutory provision I should note is s 126 of the Act. Section 126(1) and (3) provide insofar as presently relevant: 126 Review of decisions by Secretary (1) The Secretary may review: (a) subject to subsection (2), a decision of an officer under the social security law; or ... if the Secretary is satisfied that there is sufficient reason to review the decision. ... (3) The Secretary may: (a) affirm a decision; or (b) vary a decision; or (c) set a decision aside and substitute a new decision. THE HEARING AND THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION In the hearing before the Tribunal, Mr Cosenza provided further information concerning his involvement in a number of companies and trusts, as also information from his chartered accountant. He gave oral evidence as did several investigative officers from Centrelink. The principal issue before the Tribunal related to the SSAT decision that the Carer Payment to Mr Cosenza should be suspended with effect from 7 May 2008: see Reasons [3]. In [25]-[26] of its Reasons, the Tribunal made the following observations and findings: Mr Cosenza was able to provide little evidence to the Tribunal relating to the activities of ISMA and the Sarjem Family Trust. This was surprising, given that he had been a director of Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd, on and off, until 9 August 2006. As trustee of the Emjamdean Trust, he would also have been instrumental in the sale of the properties at Trimmer Parade to the Sarjem Family Trust and, on the evidence of Mr Kennedy, which was not seriously challenged by Mr Cosenza, he was actively involved in the ultimate sale of the Trimmer Parade townhouses. He was also hesitant to comment about the dispute between Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd and The Football Federation of Australia. As a director of the company for the year ended 30 June 2006, he certainly made no mention of the gross trading profit of Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd of $153,900, of purchases of $212,000, of sales of $144,000 and of closing stock of some $222,000. In the Tribunal's opinion, these matters all raised questions that necessitated the provision of further information to Centrelink in response to the notices that had been issued on 30 April 2008. For the reasons and on the basis of the findings above, there must be doubts as to Mr Cosenza's current and past Social Security entitlements. Mr Cosenza submitted that suspension of his Carer Payment was a breach of natural justice and his legal entitlement to have some benefit paid to him. The Tribunal has sympathy for his position, but the doubt about current entitlement remains and while it does it is appropriate that the Carer Payment be suspended. In his closing, Mr Parker said that the respondent wished to pay Mr Cosenza a Carer Payment but, in the absence of more information concerning his involvement in ISMA and Cosdean Investments Pty Ltd, had been unable to calculate the correct amount of his entitlement. He suggested that the additional information provided at the hearing, including that contained in the letter from Mr De Pizzol, should go a long way towards enabling the respondent to make an assessment of what benefit could be paid to Mr Cosenza. I would make the following observation of the final sentence of [26]. It is that the Reasons clearly contemplated a further decision being made by the Secretary (via a delegate) concerning whether and, if so, in what amount a carer's benefit should be paid. The Tribunal also noted that the SSAT found there was sufficient evidence before it to raise doubts about Mr Cosenza's current and past Social Security entitlements. The Tribunal as well addressed this matter in its decision. Not only did it affirm the SSAT's decision to suspend the Carer Payments, it also gave the direction that: ... the decision to raise and recover debts comprising the total amount of all benefits paid to the applicant in the period from November 2000 to May 2008 be referred back to the respondent for re-consideration in light of the further information provided at the hearing. SUBSEQUENT TO THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION It is important to emphasise there were two distinct matters in relation to each of which the Tribunal foreshadowed (\"in the case of the suspended Carer Payment\") and required (\"in relation to raising and recovering debts\") further decisions to be made by the Secretary. Each of those decisions was taken, as noted earlier, by a departmental official on 10 August 2009. The decisions, as notified to Mr Cosenza, opened with the following paragraph: I am writing to you about your previous Carers Payment, Austudy and Newstart Allowance. I am also writing to you about the debt for $91,396.50 which was raised for the period 13 November 2000 to 7 May 2008. We have considered the limited additional information which we have been able to obtain and have made decisions to affirm the correctness of the original decisions to cancel your payments from 08 May 2008 and to raise and recover the advised debt of $91,396.50. Nothing which has been provided to us fromany (sic) source establishes that you ever had any entitlement to any of the payments you received. (Emphasis added. ) I would note in passing that the \"original decisions\" referred to were those made on 20 May 2008. These were superseded by the decisions of the SSAT which in turn were superseded by the decision and direction of the Tribunal. Nothing turns on this because of the decision to which I next refer, although I should note in passing that a further amended application was filed on 19 August challenging the 10 August decision. It too was overtaken by events. On 26 November 2009, consequent on a review undertaken under s 126 of the Act, the 10 August decisions were revoked. The letter notifying Mr Cosenza of this stated amongst other things: After carefully looking at your case, the relevant parts of social security law and policy guidelines as well as taking into account the further information provided at the hearing before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in the matter of Cosenza and Secretary, Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs AATA 176 (18 March 2009), I have decided that both decisions under review are to be set aside on the basis that there is insufficient evidence available at this time to support the decisions. This means that, in accordance with the decision of the Administration Appeals Tribunal made on 18 March 2009, the status of your Carer Payment payments will revert to being suspended from 8 May 2008. This also means that, at this time, the debt of $91,396.50 ... no longer exists and any monies recovered from you in respect of this debt will be reimbursed. I would note that the 26 November decision was taken under s 126 of the Act. CONSIDERATION I have not set out the terms of the application in its various iterations which respond to the cascading decisions of Centrelink after this proceeding was begun for the following reason. I raised an issue at the beginning of the hearing with the parties so as to understand the status of the 26 November decisions. As with the 10 August decisions which it replaced, both determinations of 26 November were in obvious effectuation of the subsequent decisions foreshadowed in the AAT's reasons for decision. As I earlier indicated, the Tribunal concluded that Mr Cosenza had failed without reasonable excuse to comply with notices issued to him on 30 April 2008 and that these notices were ones made under s 63 of the Act. In consequence, s 80(1) of the Act was brought into play such that the Secretary, hence the Tribunal, was to determine that a social security payment was to be cancelled or suspended. As I earlier foreshadowed the Secretary, hence the Tribunal, had no choice but to make one or other of these decisions. It had no more general discretion in the matter: cf s 81(1). The Tribunal clearly found Mr Cosenza in default in relation to compliance with the s 63 notices and considered that while the doubt about current entitlement remained it was appropriate that the Carer Payment be suspended. While the Reasons suggest that a decision as to Mr Cosenza's entitlement to a Carer's Payment would be made primarily (but not necessarily exclusively) in reliance upon information provided at the Tribunal hearing, the Reasons by no means discountenanced the further provision of evidence by Mr Cosenza given the areas identified by the Tribunal \"that necessitated the provision of information to Centrelink in response to the notices that had been issued on 30 April 2008\": Reasons [25]. On the contrary. I have asked the respondent, if it felt able to do so, to provide me with assistance as to the statutory process that was being followed by the delegate on 10 August 2009 and which was reviewed by the Secretary on 26 November 2009 pursuant to s 126 of the Act. The respondent later advised it would not be providing further submissions in this matter. In these circumstances, and given the events which have happened, it would seem to me that the decisions taken, first, by the delegate and, then, by the Secretary insofar as they related to the Carer Payment were decisions taken by reference to the provisions of s 80(1) of the Administration Act. Considered in the context of that Act and in particular s 118(11) (which contemplates a decision to suspend under s 80 and then a subsequent decision to cancel under the same section: see also Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) s 33(1)) , the delegate's decision was a s 80 cancellation decision; the Secretary's decision was a vacation of that decision which restored the status quo, ie suspension in accordance with the Tribunal's decision. The apparent presupposition in both decisions --- consistently with the Tribunal's decision --- was that Mr Cosenza, having not complied with the s 63 notices, was a person to whom, for s 80(1) purposes, the social security payment was not payable. Insofar as concerns the decision of Secretary related to the setting aside of delegate's decision to raise and recover the debt of $91,396.50 consequent upon the Tribunal's direction to reconsider that matter, no challenge to the Secretary's decision has been foreshadowed. The essence of Mr Cosenza's complaint about the respondent's conduct is that it is over a year and a half since the Carer Payment was cancelled, although it is now only suspended since the Tribunal's decision. A decision by the respondent on his entitlement should be made within a reasonable time but such has not occurred. The short answer to this appears, as I understand it, to inhere in the scheme of the Act. Unless and until Mr Cosenza complies with the 30 April notices, the Carer Payment is not payable. In consequence the Secretary can only suspend or cancel the payment. The former course has been adopted. In light of the Tribunal's conclusions (at Reasons [25]) that further information needed to be provided in response to the 30 April notices, if the present stalemate is to be ended, Mr Cosenza has the remedy in his own hands. CONCLUSION The application will be dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Finn. Associate: Dated: 18 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Dr S Churches Counsel for the Respondent: Mr S Cole Solicitor for the Respondent: Sparke Helmore Date of Hearing: 7 December 2009 Date of Judgment: 18 December 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1525.html","title":"09_1525.txt","id":"27"},{"snippet":"(NOTICE OF MOTION) EDMONDS J: 1 Pursuant to a notice of motion filed on 25 November 2005 ('the Notice of Motion') the first respondent/second cross-respondent, Diageo Australia Limited ('Diageo'), moved the Court for orders (1) that pursuant to O 29 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules , all issues under the Further Amended Cross-Claim filed on 12 September 2005 ('the Cross-Claim') be determined separately from, and prior to, the issues in the main proceeding; and (2) that the main proceeding be stayed until determination of the Cross-Claim, subject to any conditions imposed by the Court. It is not clear whether these orders are sought in the alternative. I shall assume they are, but make it clear that if I do not think it appropriate to make an order in terms of that sought pursuant to O 29 r 2(a), I would not be prepared to make an order in terms of that in (2) above. 2 The applicants, S.P.I. Spirits (Cyprus) Limited and Spirits International N.V. (respectively 'SPI Spirits' and 'Spirits International') oppose the making of such orders. 3 Diageo submits that those orders should be made because the issue raised by the Cross-Claim, the ownership of Stolichnaya and other registered trade marks, is a threshold issue in the main proceeding and should be determined before the other issues raised in the main proceeding. The relief sought in the Cross-Claim is a declaration that one or other of the cross-claimants, Federal Treasury Enterprise (FKP) Sojuzplodoimport and Federal Public Unitary Enterprise External Economic Union Sojuzplodoimport (FGUP VO) ('FKP' and 'FGUP VO' respectively, 'the Russian Entities' collectively) own certain trade marks ('the Cross-Claim Trade Marks'), including the following: (i) No. 298659 (the Moskovskaya Label Mark) (ii) No. 298660 (the Stolichnaya Label Mark) (iii) No. 590304 (the Stoli Word Mark) (iv) No. 590305 (the Stolichnaya Word Mark) (v) No. 665684 (the Stolichnaya Ohranj Label Mark); and (vi) No. 719317 (the Stolichnaya Ohranj Word Mark). 4 SPI Spirits and Spirits International also seek a declaration that Spirits International owns those marks (par 9 of an Amended Application to be filed and served by 2 December 2005). Spirits International is currently the registered owner of the marks, having been assigned them by Diageo pursuant to consent orders made on 8 September 2005, subject to any order that the Court may make in determining the Cross-Claim. FKP and FGUP VO also seek rectification of the Register of Trade Marks to record one or other of them as owners of the trade marks. 5 Diageo submits that the issues arising in the main proceeding other than the issue of ownership of the marks are quite different from those arising under the Cross-Claim. This is demonstrated, it is said, by the fact that Diageo, although a respondent to the Cross-Claim has no relief sought against it and FKP has no interest in the main proceeding once the issue of ownership of the marks is determined. BACKGROUND 6 These proceedings were initially commenced by SPI Spirits and Spirits International against Diageo (then the sole respondent) by way of application and statement of claim filed on 7 December 2004. The relief sought by SPI Spirits and Spirits International in the application was founded on two primary claims made against Diageo, characterised in the affidavit of Kathryn Cecilia Everett, sworn 28 November 2005 and filed by Diageo in support of its notice of motion, as the Ruski Claims and the SPI Trade Mark Claims. 7 In her affidavit, Ms Everett indicates that the Ruski Claims are founded on ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the TPA') and concern the distribution of a ready-to-drink, low alcohol beverage distributed by Diageo in Australia under the name 'Lemon Ruski' ('Ruski'). For the reasons set out in pars 5 --- 37 of the Statement of Claim, SPI Spirits and Spirits International plead that the distribution by Diageo of Ruski in Australia in its current packaging constitutes misleading or deceptive conduct. The distribution is said to continue; on SPI Spirits and Spirits International's case it continues to mislead. 8 The SPI Trade Mark Claims concern the construction of the Distribution Agreement (as defined in Ms Everett's affidavit). SPI Spirits and Spirits International plead that on a correct construction of this agreement, Diageo was obliged to assign certain trade marks (which include some of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks) to Spirits International upon expiry of the agreement on 4 September 2005 (or upon earlier termination of the agreement). In September 2005 Diageo assigned these trade marks to Spirits International pursuant to interlocutory orders made by consent in these proceedings in May 2005. However, Diageo continues to defend the SPI Trade Mark Claims. 9 SPI Spirits and Spirits International have sought and been granted leave to file and serve an Amended Statement of Claim by 2 December 2005 which adds a cause of action relating to alleged further breaches by Diageo of the Distribution Agreement (breach of which is already pleaded by SPI Spirits and Spirits International in the SPI Trade Mark Claims). These claims are referred to in Ms Everett's affidavit as the 'New Contractual Claims'. The New Contractual Claims are only made by SPI Spirits, which is not a party to the Cross-Claim. 10 On 14 December 2004 the Russian Entities (against whom no facts were, or are, pleaded by SPI Spirits and Spirits International and against whom no relief was, or is, claimed) filed a notice of motion in the proceedings seeking orders that they be joined as parties. SPI Spirits and SPI International opposed this motion but on 17 December 2004 Gyles J delivered an ex tempore judgment and ordered that FKP be added as the second respondent to the proceedings to enable it to file a cross-claim. FGUP VO was joined as second cross-claimant by consent of all parties in May 2005. 11 The Cross-Claim filed by the Russian Entities seeks rectification of the Trade Marks Register under s 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) so that: (1) FKP, or alternatively FGUP VO, is recorded as the registered owner of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks; or (2) in the alternative, the Cross-Claim Trade Marks are cancelled. The Russian Entities also seek a declaration that FKP, or alternatively FGUP VO, is the owner of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks. 12 SPI Spirits is not a party to the Cross-Claim. Spirits International is defending the Cross-Claim on several grounds outlined in its Defence to the Cross-Claim filed on 16 September 2005. The Russian Entities' claim for relief in relation to the Cross-Claim Trade Marks is apparently founded on events which occurred around the time of the disintegration of the Soviet Union in December 1991. In the intervening fourteen years, SPI Spirits and Spirits International and their predecessors in title have continuously and actively used the Cross-Claim Trade Marks in Australia, by promoting and selling an extensive and substantial volume of vodka products under those trade marks, either directly or through local distributors. During this fourteen year period, SPI Spirits and Spirits International and their predecessors in title have also registered (or authorised their distributors to register) the Cross-Claim Trade Marks in Australia and in many countries around the world. 13 Having regard to the aforementioned matters, SPI Spirits and Spirits International submit that these proceedings comprise several distinct claims, the outcome of each of which is unlikely to have a significant impact upon the outcome of the others. The claims made by the Russian Entities in their Cross-Claim, while part of these proceedings as presently constituted, arise out of a substantially different and unrelated set of facts from those which underpin the Amended Statement of Claim. SPI Spirits and Spirits International submit that determination of the Russian Entities' application for rectification of the Trade Marks Register will have no bearing on the outcome of the claims set out in the Amended Statement of Claim. They further submit that the questions in the Amended Statement of Claim do not turn upon the issue of ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks but are founded either in contract (the SPI Trade Mark Claims and the New Contractual Claims) or under ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the TPA (the Ruski Claims); SPI Spirits and Spirits International do not rely upon their ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks in support of any of these claims; and irrespective of the outcome of the Cross-Claim, SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be entitled to pursue and intend to pursue these claims against Diageo. CLAIMS IN THE MAIN PROCEEDING 14 There are three separate causes of action pleaded in the Amended Statement of Claim, which can be described as characterised above: (1) The Ruski Claims (pars 5 --- 37); (2) The SPI Trade Mark Claims (pars 38 --- 51); (3) The New Contractual Claims (pars 51A --- 51AL). 15 Not surprisingly, the relevant parties, Diageo on the one hand, and SPI Spirit and Spirits International on the other, attach very different standing and importance to the determination of the ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks in the Court's consideration of these claims. Diageo asserts that ownership of the marks is a threshold and underlying issue, the determination of which, to a greater or lesser extent, will impact upon the outcome of all three claims in the main proceeding. SPI Spirits and Spirits International, on the other hand, assert that even if the Cross-Claim is determined adversely to Spirits International, SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be entitled to pursue their claims against Diageo in contract and under ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the TPA. The Ruski Claims 16 Diageo submitted that: (1) These claims seek relief for alleged misleading and deceptive conduct by Diageo pursuant to ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the TPA relating to Diageo's sale of its Ruski RTD product. The misleading representations are said to arise, in essence, from the fact that Diageo, having distributed Ruski in a get-up that included the mark Stolichnaya, SPI Spirits and Spirits International acquired substantial reputation and goodwill in the brands Stolichnaya and Stoli and then from 16 April 2004, having distributed without the mark Stolichnaya, Diageo is representing that, by its continued use of the other features of the get-up, the product is still in the minds of the public associated with Stolichnaya. (2) A consideration of the Ruski Claims makes it clear that the underlying premise of the claims is that SPI Spirits and Spirits International have a reputation in the mark Stolichnaya. Diageo submits that, if the cross-claimants owned the mark, then even if SPI Spirits and Spirits International had acquired reputation and goodwill, that would be held on trust for the cross-claimants. (3) The issue of ownership is clearly a threshold issue and there does not appear to be any other overlap between the Ruski Claims and the Cross-Claim. (4) Diageo distributed Diageo Stolichnaya Vodka in Australia for nine years between September 1996 and September 2005 and has sold Ruski in Australia continuously since 1997. Ms Everett, in her affidavit, has said that, based on her experience and her knowledge of the matter, extensive evidence is likely to be required in relation to these claims and has expressed the view that discovery in relation to the claims is also likely to be considerable and onerous given the length of time during which Diageo sold Diageo Stolichnaya Vodka and has sold Ruski. (5) There would be no prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International if the Ruski Claims were not heard until after the determination of the Cross-Claim for the following reasons: (a) Diageo commenced sale of Ruski in the current Ruski get-up in April 2004. The proceedings were not commenced until 7 December 2004 and no interlocutory relief has been sought in relation to the Ruski Claims. (b) No steps have been taken other than the filing of a defence and no steps have been taken by SPI Spirits and Spirits International to progress the Ruski Claims. (c) SPI Spirits and Spirits International now seek to file an Amended Statement of Claim which adds significant new claims to the proceedings. (d) SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be entitled to interest on any damages it might be awarded in relation to the Ruski Claims and therefore would be compensated for any delay in payment. 17 SPI Spirits and Spirits International submitted that: (1) These claims are founded on ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the TPA and concern allegations of misleading and deceptive conduct. SPI Spirits and Spirits International's standing to bring the Ruski Claims is not in any way contingent upon Spirits International's past or present ownership of, or rights in, the Cross-Claim Trade Marks. (2) It is admitted by Diageo in its defence, inter alia , that from 1996, Diageo distributed vodka in Australia under the Stolichnaya trade mark pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement with SPI Spirits and its predecessors. It is further admitted by Diageo in its defence that between 8 July 1997 and 1 September 2004 this vodka was used as an ingredient in the manufacture of Ruski. (3) In relation to these claims, the primary issue for determination by the Court is whether Australian consumers and traders are likely to be misled, by reason of the past and present labelling and get-up of Ruski, into believing that: (a) Ruski presently distributed by Diageo contains Stolichnaya vodka; or (b) there exists some other form of connection between Ruski and Stolichnaya vodka or the makers of that vodka. (4) Neither of these primary issues concerns, or is materially connected to, the question of continuing ownership of the registered trade mark for Stolichnaya in Australia under the Trade Marks Act . Regardless of the outcome of the Cross-Claim, the fact remains that for at least fourteen years, vodka sold under the Stolichnaya brand in Australia is vodka that has been manufactured by SPI Spirits and Spirits International and their immediate predecessors. (5) If these claims were to be stayed or heard separately and after the Cross-Claim, SPI Spirits and Spirits International are likely to suffer substantial prejudice given the nature of these claims. In particular, on SPI Spirits and Spirits International's case, Diageo is continuing to engage in the allegedly misleading and deceptive conduct, through its continuing distribution of Ruski in Australia in the livery which is the subject of the Ruski Claims. (6) Given the nature of these claims, it can be anticipated that both parties will wish to adduce consumer and/or survey evidence relating to the matters in issue in the Ruski Claims. The substance of this evidence will naturally change over time and while some such evidence has already been prepared, SPI Spirits and Spirits International are likely to wish to prepare further consumer and/or survey evidence in preparation for trial. As a consequence, SPI Spirits and Spirits International are likely to suffer substantial prejudice if the Ruski Claims are not to be heard until after the determination of the Cross-Claim. If any alternative course is to be adopted, SPI Spirits and Spirits International submit that the Ruski Claims should proceed to a final hearing as soon as possible, and possibly prior to the hearing of the Cross-Claim. The SPI Trade Mark Claims 18 Diageo submitted that: (1) These claims are essentially a claim that Diageo was required to assign eight trade marks to Spirits International at the expiry of the Distribution Agreement and that Diageo failed to take certain steps in advance of that assignment. (2) The underlying basis of the agreements between Diageo (previously United Distillers (Aust) Pty Ltd) and SPI Spirits and Spirits International or their predecessors was that the vodka supplied to Diageo for distribution in Australia was brand name vodka labelled with the various trade marks. (3) The Cross-Claim relates to only six of those marks and not to the marks known as the Pertsovka Label Mark and the Limonnaya Label Mark. All of the eight trade marks have been assigned to Spirits International pursuant to the consent orders referred to above. As Spirits International now has full use of the marks, it is unlikely that SPI Spirits and Spirits International would suffer any prejudice if these claims were not determined until after the determination of the Cross-Claim. (4) If SPI Spirits and Spirits International and their predecessors did not have any rights in the marks at the time the Distribution Agreement was entered into or when the trade marks were assigned to Diageo, then they are not entitled to any relief in relation to the marks or any conduct related to the Agreement. 19 SPI Spirits and Spirits International submitted that: (1) These claims are founded in contract. They relate specifically to the construction of certain written contractual terms and whether certain terms can be implied in the Distribution Agreement (when read together or as amended by a number of subsequent agreements). In particular, SPI Spirits and Spirits International allege that the effect of the written terms was to require Diageo to assign to Spirits International on 4 September 2004 a number of trade marks, including some of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks which were registered during the term of the Distribution Agreement in the name of Diageo with the authority of SPI Spirits and Spirits International. SPI Spirits and Spirits International also allege that there was a breach of certain implied terms as a result of Diageo's failure to confirm that it would assign the relevant trade marks to Spirits International on 4 September 2005. (2) These claims involve questions of contractual construction which do not turn upon, or which cannot be materially affected by, any determination of the issues in the Cross-Claim. Whether or not the Court determines that the Cross-Claim Trade Marks should be cancelled or that either of the Russian Entities be recorded as the owner of those trade marks (each, of course, being a proposition that SPI Spirits and Spirits International strongly resist), this will not affect the Court's decision on whether, as a matter of contractual construction, the relevant terms of the agreements between SPI Spirits and Spirits International on the one hand and Diageo on the other have the meaning and effect which is alleged by SPI Spirits and SPI International. (3) From a procedural perspective, in providing discovery both in relation to the Cross-Claim and the Amended Statement of Claim, SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be required to conduct a thorough review of documents in their possession, custody or power relating to the Cross-Claim Trade Marks. It would create a substantial and unjust burden if SPI Spirits and Spirits International were required to conduct discovery of documents twice; first, in relation to the Cross-Claim and then subsequently in relation to the statement of claim. This is a further reason that it is both in the interests of the parties and the efficient conduct of the proceedings that the claims in the Amended Statement of Claim and Cross-Claim be heard together. New Contractual Claims 20 Diageo submitted that: (1) These claims add an entirely new cause of action for damages in relation to alleged breaches by Diageo of the Distribution Agreement. They relate to the sales and promotion by Diageo of Diageo Stolichnaya Vodka. Although, like the SPI Trade Mark Claims, these claims relate to alleged obligations of Diageo under the Distribution Agreement, these claims have a different basis than the SPI Trade Mark Claims. (2) Ms Everett has identified each of the eight terms alleged to have been breached, the evidence and discovery required in respect of each allegation and the lack of prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International if the determination of the allegations is deferred. 21 SPI Spirits and Spirits International submitted that: (1) These claims relate to various alleged breaches of the Distribution Agreement. The Distribution Agreement, in substance, is a product distribution agreement under which SPI Spirits (and its predecessors in title) appointed Diageo as the exclusive distributor of a range of vodka products in Australia. In particular, SPI Spirits and its predecessors agreed to supply Diageo and Diageo agreed to acquire from them vodka in certain minimum quantities. Under the Distribution Agreement, Diageo was subject to certain obligations, the terms of which were expressly set out in the Distribution Agreement. (2) The obligations which Diageo is alleged by SPI Spirits to have breached include obligations of Diageo to: (a) purchase certain minimum quantities of the Goods from SPI Spirits; (b) use reasonable commercial endeavours and diligence to promote the sale of the Goods in Australia; (c) not denigrate or diminish the reputation and goodwill of the Goods or SPI Spirits (and its predecessors); (d) inform SPI Sprits and its predecessors of all facts or opinions likely to be relevant in relation to the manufacture, sale, use or development of the Goods in Australia ; (e) submit to SPI Spirits (and its predecessors) quarterly sales reports and annual budget forecasts for sales of the Goods in Australia; and (f) submit an annual marketing budget plan indicating all actions which Diageo considered necessary to properly support and increase distribution and sales in Australia. (3) SPI Spirits submits that none of these obligations, which are standard obligations applying to the distribution of goods, concerns or turns upon Spirits International's ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks. Further, determining the questions raised in the Cross-Claim in relation to the ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks is not likely to have any bearing on the question of whether Diageo breached the above obligations. ORDER 29 RULE 2(A) OF THE FEDERAL COURT RULES : GENERAL PRINCIPLES 22 There is substantial, perhaps even total, common ground between the parties as to the general principles to be applied by the Court in deciding whether or not to make an order in terms of that sought by Diageo on its notice of motion pursuant to O 29 r 2(a) of the Federal Court Rules . 23 The starting point is that, in the ordinary course, all issues of fact and law should be determined at the one time: Tallglen Pty Ltd v Pay TV Holdings Pty Ltd (1996) 22 ACSR 130; Bathox Australia Pty Ltd v PJ SAS Trading Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 1082 ; Reading Australia Pty Ltd v Australian Mutual Provident Society (1999) 217 ALR 495. 24 The Court's discretion under O 29 r 2 should be exercised with caution: Chippendale Printing Co Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1995) 17 ACSR 328. For the Court to depart from the ordinary course, the party seeking the separate determination of the issues must satisfy the Court that it would be 'just and convenient' for the order to be made: Reading Australia , supra. The test is 'the practical one of utility, efficiency and convenience in the administration of justice' : Chippendale Printing , supra. 25 The Court has found that it may be appropriate to hear a preliminary issue where there is a 'crisp and clear demurrer point': Novartis AG v FH Faulding and Co Ltd [2004] FCAFC 254. Alternatively, the Court may decide to hear a question separately if there is a narrow point raised on the preliminary issue, and it has the potential to dispose of a significant part of the litigation if decided in one way: TVW Enterprises Ltd v Duffy ( Toohey J, 28 March 1985, unreported ) ; see also Orison Pty Ltd v Strategic Minerals Corporation NL (1987) 77 ALR 141 . In CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill (1985) 1 NSWLR 601 at 606, Kirby P expressed the view: 'A matter is \"ripe\" for separate and preliminary determination where it is a central issue in contention between the parties, the resolution of which will either obviate the necessity of litigation altogether or substantially narrow the field of controversy. ' 26 In Reading Australia supra, Branson J summarised the relevant principles governing the exercise of the Court's discretion under O 29 r 2, identifying the following factors as being relevant to that discretion: '(a) [T] he term \"question\" in O 29 r 1 includes any question or issue of fact or law in a proceeding. The distinction in the rule between an \"issue\" and a \"question\" is the distinction between that which, when resolved, will result in an adjudication in favour of one party or the other, being an \"issue\", and less decisive matters of dispute being \"questions\" ( Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society (1993) 41 FCR 421 at 425; 113 ALR 643 at 647); (b) a question can be the subject of an order for a separate decision under O 29 r 2 even though a decision on such a question will not determine any of the parties' rights ( Landsal Pty Ltd (in liq) v REI Building Society at FCR 425; ALR 647); (c) however, the judicial determination of a question under O 29 r 2 must involve a conclusive or final decision based on concrete and established or agreed facts for the purpose of quelling a controversy between the parties ( Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd (1999) 198 CLR 334; 161 ALR 399; [1999] HCA 9 at [45] ); (d) where the preliminary question is one of mixed fact and law, it is necessary that the question can be precisely formulated and that all of the facts that are on any fairly arguable view relevant to the determination of the question are ascertainable either as facts assumed to be correct for the purposes of the preliminary determination, or as agreed facts or as facts to be judicially determined ( Jacobson v Ross [1995] 1 VR 337 at 341, referring to Nissan v Attorney-General [1969] UKHL 3 ; [1970] AC 179 at 242-3; [1969] 1 All ER 629 at 663-4 per Lord Pearson; Bass v Perpetual Trustee at [53]); (e) care must be taken in utilising the procedure provided for in O 29 r 1 to avoid the determination of issues not \"ripe\" for separate and preliminary determination. An issue may not be \"ripe\" for separate and preliminary determination in this sense where it is simply one of two or more alternative ways in which an applicant frames its case and determination of the issue would leave significant other issues unresolved ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill (1985) 1 NSWLR 601 per Kirby P at 606); (f) factors which tend to support the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the separate determination of the question may: (i) contribute to the saving of time and cost by substantially narrowing the issues for trial, or even lead to disposal of the action; or (ii) contribute to the settlement of the litigation ( CBS Productions Pty Ltd v O'Neill per Kirby P at 607); (g) factors which tell against the making of an order under O 29 r 2 include that the separate determination of the question may --- (ii) give rise to significant contested factual issues both at the time of the hearing of the preliminary question and at the time of trial ( GMB Research & Development Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth [1997] FCA 934) ; (iii) result in significant overlap between the evidence adduced on the hearing of the separate question and at trial - possibly involving the calling of the same witnesses at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding ( GMB Research & Development Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth; Arnold v Attorney-General (Vic) (unreported, Fed C of A, Sundberg J, Nos VG629-37 of 1995, 8 September 1995, BC9502745). This factor will be of particular significance if the Court may be required to form a view as to the credibility of witnesses who may give evidence at both stages of the hearing of the proceeding; or (iv) prolong rather than shorten the litigation ( GMB Research & Development Pty Ltd v The Commonwealth ). ' 27 In Novartis Crop Protection Australasia Pty Ltd v Orica Australia Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1013 , Stone J said at [7]: 'In particular circumstances the separate decision of a question may be appropriate even if it will not bring the proceedings to an end. Examples are where there is a strong prospect that once the core of their dispute is decided, the parties will settle the remaining issues or where the decision will obviate an unnecessary and expensive hearing of other questions. Such situations must, however, be carefully controlled lest fragmentation of the proceedings should bring delay, expense and hardship, which the making of the order was intended to avoid. ' SUBMISSIONS 28 Diageo submits that the order sought should be made for the following reasons: (a) It is clear that the issues in the main proceeding will require voluminous discovery and extensive evidence. (b) There is nothing at this stage which indicates that there will be any commonality of evidence or witnesses (other than in relation to the issues of ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks) that would make it convenient to hear both the Cross-Claim and the Amended Statement of Claim together. Diageo submits that the determining of the Cross-Claim prior to the Amended Statement of Claim may in fact avoid the costs and inconvenience of a hearing on the Amended Statement of Claim, if the Cross-Claim is determined in the cross-claimants' favour. Diageo is unlikely to recover all of its costs in this case and will have expended a considerable amount of time as well as money. (c) There is no prejudice to the cross-claimants if the orders are made and it may assist the cross-claimants in having their claims heard earlier. (d) There does not appear to be any prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International other than a delay in payment of any damages that might be awarded, a prejudice that will be compensated by payment of interest. The Distribution Agreement has come to an end, Diageo is no longer distributing Diageo Stolichnaya Vodka, and SPI Spirits has entered into an agreement with another company for the distribution of its vodka in Australia. (e) The determination of such a decisive issue is likely to be a major factor to both SPI Spirits and Diageo in considering settlement. (f) As stated above, the main proceeding has not progressed at all beyond a defence and reply and is now back to the beginning with the proposed filing of an Amended Application and Amended Statement of Claim which significantly alter the overall case against Diageo. The conduct which is the subject of the main proceeding has either concluded or, in the case of the Ruski Claims, commenced in April 2004 and no interlocutory injunction has been sought. (g) Resolution of the issue of ownership of the marks is likely to contribute to settlement. 29 Finally, Diageo submits that there is an important issue of case management to be considered, not merely in relation to the inconvenience to Diageo if all claims in the proceeding are heard together. There is also the convenience of the Court. Not only might hearing time be reduced, both for the trial and any interlocutory disputes, but there would be considerable benefits for the trial judge. If all claims are heard together, the trial judge, in writing his or her judgment, may consider it necessary to determine the ownership issue first. If the ownership issue is determined in favour of the cross-claimants, the trial judge is likely to feel obliged to determine all the remaining issues on the Amended Statement of Claim. If the issue of ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks is fundamental to the Amended Statement of Claim, then both the Court's and the parties' resources may have been unnecessarily wasted. 30 In order to minimise any prejudice to SPI Spirits and Spirits International, Diageo offered to make the following undertakings if the orders are made: (a) Not to destroy any documents relevant to the issues raised by the Amended Statement of Claim (yet to be filed); (b) to maintain comprehensive sales records relating to Ruski; (c) to agree to be bound by the final determination of the Court of the Amended Cross-Claim. 31 SPI Spirits and Spirits International submitted that determination of the Cross-Claim will not, for the reasons outlined above, likely dispose of or substantially narrow the issues arising in the Amended Statement of Claim. Even if the Cross-Claim is determined adversely to Spirits International, SPI Spirits and Spirits International will be entitled to pursue their claims against Diageo in contract and under ss 52 , 53 and 55 of the TPA. 32 Given the complexity of the issues raised in the Cross-Claim and the fact that the Cross-Claim relates primarily to events which occurred in the Soviet Union and Russia almost fourteen years ago, SPI Spirits and Spirits International estimate that discovery and evidence in relation to the Cross-Claim are likely to consume most of 2006. In the view of SPI Spirits and Spirits International, the Cross-Claim is highly unlikely to proceed to a final hearing until at least 2007. If the Court was to defer the hearing of the claims in the Amended Statement of Claim until after determination of the Cross-Claim, the likely consequence will be that the claims in the Amended Statement of Claim will not proceed to trial until at least 2008, three or four years after SPI Spirits and Spirits International filed their Statement of Claim against Diageo. The substantial prejudice likely to be suffered by SPI Spirits and Spirits International as a consequence of this delay is a further reason to refuse the orders sought by Diageo in its notice of motion. CONCLUSION 33 The determination of the ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks, as between Spirits International on the one hand and one or other of the Russian Entities on the other, is certainly not, having regard to the claims in the main proceeding, a 'crisp and clear demurrer point'. Moreover, I am not convinced that its determination has the potential to dispose of a significant part of the main proceeding if it is decided in favour of one or other of the Russian Entities. 34 It would, in my view, be fair to say that resolution of the ownership of the Cross-Claim Trade Marks in favour of one or other of the Russian Entities may well promote the prospect of settlement between SPI Spirits and Diageo in the main proceeding, if only because such a resolution may adversely impact the measure of damages SPI Spirits and Spirits International might otherwise be expected to retain for themselves, if they are successful in their claims in the main proceeding. But I am not persuaded this is sufficient to warrant the making of an order pursuant to O 29 r 2(a) of the kind sought by Diageo. 35 Nor do I think Diageo's submission that the interests of the cross-claimants are a relevant consideration --- that there is no prejudice to them if the orders are made; and that it may assist them in having their claims heard earlier. In my opinion, the only relevant interests are those of the parties in the main proceeding. It is true that FKP was joined as a second respondent in the main proceeding, but that was only to enable it to bring the Cross-Claim. FKP is, effectively, a dormant party in the main proceeding and Diageo is a dormant party in the Cross-Claim. 36 I am also of the view that the following matters are, inter alia , relevant considerations: (1) The main proceeding, as originally pleaded, raised no issue of the ownership of any of the relevant trade marks. (2) That issue only arises by virtue of the Cross-Claim, and then only with respect to the Cross-Claim Trade Marks; and that was only facilitated by order of this Court joining FKP as second respondent. (3) This background context stands in stark contrast to the background of the authorities to which I have been referred by both sides; invariably, the issue the subject of the O 29 r 2 order has been latent in the proceeding from the outset, either from a claim made in the original pleadings, or in the defence filed in response; not, as it were, in a Cross-Claim brought by a non-party to the original proceedings from 'left field'. (4) What I consider to be a very relevant question is: Why should SPI Spirits and Spirits International have the hearing of their claim against Diageo deferred for more than a year, perhaps longer, until the determination of the ownership claim by the Russian Entities against SPI Spirits International? I do not know that this question can be satisfactorily answered, but if it can, it is certainly not irrelevant to its answer that only Spirits International is a respondent to the Cross-Claim whereas SPI Spirits is the principal applicant in the main proceeding. (5) It is against this background, and not the background of other cases, that the general principles referred to above need to be applied. (6) I think it is fair to conclude that the issue of ownership of the relevant trade marks as pleaded in the Cross-Claim involves matters of fact and law which have little, if anything, to do with the claims brought against Diageo in the main proceeding. But that, of itself, is no basis to defer a hearing of the latter until a determination of the former. (7) As I have already indicated at [34] supra, I think it fair to conclude that if one or other of the Russian Entities were to succeed in their Cross-Claim against SPI Spirits and Spirits International on the ownership issue, this would likely promote settlement prospects in the main proceeding by SPI Spirits and Spirits International against Diageo. I have already indicated one possible reason for this but there may be others. Even if there are, one thing can be said with certainty --- such a determination of ownership rights would not extinguish the basis of the claims brought in the main proceeding. (8) A number of the submissions made by Diageo as to why an order should be made in the terms sought pursuant to O 29 r 2 are predicated on the basis that if the Cross-Claim is determined in the cross-claimants' favour, there will be savings in terms of time, cost and other matters relevant to efficient case management. In many cases, it may be possible to make an informed judgment about the prospects of success on the issue which is sought to be determined on a preliminary basis, however, in the present case the complexity of the issues involved and the lack of evidence, at least at this stage, make this an impossible call. In my considered view, the issue before me has to be determined without regard to the respective prospects of success of one or other of the Russian Entities and Spirits International on the Cross-Claim. 37 In the face of all these matters ([33] --- [36] inclusive), I have come to the conclusion that an order in the terms sought by Diageo pursuant to O 29 r 2(a) should be refused and that the issue of ownership of the relevant trade marks raised by the Cross-Claim should not be bifurcated from the main proceeding. 38 The Notice of Motion is dismissed with costs. I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds.

The draft Notice of Appeal seeks to challenge the orders and judgment of a Federal Magistrate given 15 July 2009 (see SZNHN v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FMCA 702) , dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (Tribunal) made on 2 February 2009. The decision of the Tribunal affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent (the Minister) to refuse to grant the applicant a protection visa. The Minister opposes that application for reason of futility on the basis that no error in the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate has been identified and there is no other ground of appeal with any apparent prospect of success. PRIOR APPLICATIONS The applicant, who is a citizen of India, arrived in Australia on 18 June 2008 having been granted a Tourist (Class TR) subclass 676 visa. On 17 July 2008, the applicant lodged a protection visa application (PVA) with the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. In a statement accompanying his PVA, the applicant claimed to be an active member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam political party (DMK) who actively support the rights of the Dalit caste. As a result, the applicant was persecuted and assaulted by the higher castes who disapproved of his support for Dalit rights, particularly his participation in the demolition of a wall between high-caste and scheduled caste areas in a nearby village. The Federal Magistrate has provided the following helpful analysis of both the delegate's and Tribunal's consideration of the applicant's claims at [3] to [11] of her reasons for judgment: [3] The applicant attended a Departmental interview and provided further information, in particular about the wall and his presence when it was demolished in March/April 2008. His application was refused by a delegate of the first respondent who found that the applicant's claims were vague, unconvincing and unsubstantiated by any evidence. The delegate found, in any event, that State protection was available and that relocation was a viable alternative. [4] The applicant sought review by the Tribunal. He did not provide any additional statement or supporting documentation to the Tribunal. [5] The Tribunal invited the applicant to attend a hearing on 18 December 2008. He did so and provided the Tribunal with a copy of his passport. By letter under s.424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) of 24 December 2008 the Tribunal put to the applicant information consisting of certain inconsistencies between his responses to the delegate in the Departmental interview and in his protection visa application and inconsistencies between certain independent country information and his claims. The applicant was given until 21 January 2009 to respond and advised that if he could not respond by that time he may ask the Tribunal in writing for an extension of time. On 20 January 2009 the applicant wrote to the Tribunal providing comments as requested. He claimed that he was deeply traumatised being a victim of persecution and had stress and ongoing difficulties including recollection of past incidents, confusion and memory loss. He sought forgiveness for inconsistencies between his evidence to the Department and the Tribunal and claimed that what he said in his initial statement was true and correct. [6] In its reasons for decision the Tribunal set out the applicant's claims in his application, the Departmental interview and at the Tribunal hearing as well as the s.424A letter and the response and referred to relevant country information, in particular in relation to the wall between the high caste areas and the Dalit areas. [7] In its findings and reasons the Tribunal concluded that it did not find the applicant to be credible on some key aspects of his claims. It was not satisfied that he left India because of the fear of persecution described in his application and evidence before the Tribunal. It set out inconsistencies, implausibilities and contradictions that led it to conclude that the applicant was not truthful or credible, including inconsistent evidence from him about whether he had a membership card for the DMK and his failure to provide any documentation supporting that claim or his claim to have been hospitalised. In those circumstances the Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant was a member of the DMK. It was of the view that if the applicant had been assaulted as claimed and admitted to hospital and treated for two days he would have provided such documentation. It was not satisfied that he was assaulted or treated for an assault as claimed. [8] The Tribunal also had regard to inconsistencies between the applicant's description of the caste wall and the independent country information in relation to when the wall was erected and its dimensions. The applicant had stated that the wall was erected in 2008. Country information stated that it was erected in 1989 or 1990 and that it was 12 feet high and 600 metres long. The applicant claimed it was about his height (5ft 8 inches) and 200 --- 300 feet long. The Tribunal considered the applicant's response when these issues were raised with him during the hearing. The Tribunal found the applicant's explanations relating to this incorrect information (that the police would not allow him to go there and that he was only interested in the demolition) to be unpersuasive. [9] It also had regard to inconsistencies in relation to whether and how the applicant had reported a claimed assault to police and as to what occurred in the incident when he claimed that a group of people had come to his family home after he had left India. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant's wife was approached or questioned or harmed. The Tribunal also had regard to the applicant's evidence that he continued to live at his home address prior to leaving India and continued working for the party after a claimed assault. It was of the view that if he had been in fear as claimed, he would not have continued to live at his home address in India. [10] These matters collectively led the Tribunal to find that the applicant was not credible. It rejected his claim he was a member of the DMK in India and therefore all the claims that flowed from that claim, including any claims in relation to involvement in demolition of the wall, injury, assault and warnings and that he departed India because of a fear of persecution. [11] The Tribunal considered the applicant's claim in response to the s.424A letter that he was suffering from stress, was deeply traumatised and had difficulty recalling what had happened. However it also had regard to the fact that when it had asked the applicant questions in the hearing it would expect him to answer in relation to the wall, it was evident that he knew very little about it. It was of the view that his lack of knowledge in relation to the wall was not because he was traumatised or had difficulty recalling, but because he had not seen it and had not been involved in activities in relation to the wall or its destruction. It was the Tribunal's view that the inconsistencies arose because the applicant had forgotten what he mentioned in his protection visa application and in his Departmental interview. The Tribunal was not satisfied that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason if he returned to India. \" DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE On 5 March 2009, the applicant filed an application in the Federal Magistrates Court, seeking judicial review of the Tribunal decision. On 19 May 2009, the applicant filed an amended application. The amended application contained two grounds of review. Ground 1 claimed: The Tribunal failed to exercise its power by failing to consider claims that arose on the material before it, namely: I face risk [of] persecution by the political party thugs opposed to the DMK and the political parties oppose the people supporting the low cast people. The Federal Magistrate found that ground one was not made out for the reasons set out at [13]-[14] of her judgment: [13] The evidence of the applicant's claims to the delegate in the statement accompanying the protection visa application and the Tribunal's account of the Departmental interview as well as the evidence of the Tribunal hearing indicate that the applicant's claims did not relate to political opponents of the DMK but rather to high caste people. This is apparent from the applicant's written statement, the delegate's summary of the interview, the applicant's response to the s.424A letter (which again referred to an attack by high caste people) and the Tribunal's account of the applicant's claims made to the delegate and also at the Tribunal hearing. [14] In any event, in its findings and reasons the Tribunal considered the applicant's claim that he was a member of the DMK party, but having rejected that claim, rejected all claims that flowed from that claim. In those circumstances, even if the applicant had raised a claim to be at risk from political opponents of the DMK, as the first respondent submitted, the Tribunal would not have been required to make a finding on that claim because it rejected the factual premise on which such a claim rested (see WAEE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCAFC 184 ; (2003) 75 ALD 630). Ground 2 claimed: The RRT did not call me for second hearing after the section 424A letter to me. The RRT failed to deal with the critical matters [which] arose in the 424A letter by calling for a second hearing. The Federal Magistrate found that ground two was not made out for the reasons set out at [15]-[18] of her judgment: [15] The second ground in the amended application is that the Tribunal did not call the applicant for a second hearing after the s.424A letter and failed to deal with the critical matters that arose in the s.424A letter by calling for a second hearing. In oral submissions the applicant contended that he had asked the Tribunal at the Tribunal hearing for a second hearing and that had he had that hearing he would have been able to provide documents. [16] Dealing first with the ground as it appears in the amended application, as set out above, the s.424A letter raised a number of inconsistencies between the applicant's claims in his protection visa application, the Departmental interview and at the Tribunal hearing and also inconsistencies between his claims and independent country information. However those inconsistencies do not amount to fresh determinative issues such as to trigger any obligation to invite the applicant to a further hearing under s.425 of the [2006] HCA 63 ; Act (see SZBEL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2006) 228 CLR 152). [17] It is apparent that, according to the Tribunal account of what occurred in the Tribunal hearing, a number of these inconsistencies were explicitly raised with the applicant at the hearing, in particular in relation to his claims about the wall and country information, whether an assault was reported to the police and whether his wife had been assaulted. [18] Other inconsistencies resulted from the applicant's responses in relation to matters such as how he lost a membership card and whether he was present when the wall was demolished. These were also matters discussed at the hearing. The fact that the Tribunal identified inconsistencies between such claims and earlier accounts is not such as to give rise to an obligation to invite the applicant to a further hearing to address such inconsistencies. To the extent that such matters were in fact information within s.424A(1) of the Act, they were put to the applicant under that section. Her Honour also considered a ground in the original application, a number of other complaints made orally by the applicant at the hearing and independently considered whether there may have been any failure to comply with the requirements of s 424. Her Honour found no jurisdictional error was made out. APPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME Order 52, r 15(2) of the Federal Court Rules 1979 (Cth) gives the Court power to give an applicant leave to file and serve a notice of appeal at any time for \"special reasons\". The reasons given by the applicant in support of his application for extension of time are found in his affidavit filed on 11 August 2009. Relevantly the applicant states:- I have no lawyer... On 15 July 2009 I went to the Court for hearing and my case was dismissed. I did not know that I should appeal before my judgment was given. I received my judgment on 29 July 2009 therefore I thought I had 21 days from 29 July 2009. The principles to be applied in considering an application for an extension of time in which to file a notice of appeal were discussed by the Full Court (per Lockhart, Sheppard and Burchett JJ) in Jess v Scott (1986) 12 FCR 187. Order 52, r 15(2) provides a flexible discretion to the Court as to what will constitute a \"special reason\" for the grant of an extension of time. Generally, it is accepted that the following factors should be considered: the integrity of the time limits; the adequacy of the explanation for the delay; questions of prejudice to a respondent, although mere lack of prejudice is not sufficient for leave to be granted; and the merits of the substantial application. See SZMNO v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2009] FCA 797 and authorities referred to at [12] --- [15]. The applicant's delay in filing was short. He was apparently unsure exactly when the appeal had to be lodged. No prejudice is evident or claimed by the Minister. The question here is whether the proposed grounds of appeal disclose any prospects of success in an appeal. The applicant has filed a draft notice of appeal. The draft notice of appeal does not directly identify any error of law in the reasons for judgment of the Federal Magistrate but repeats (in substance) grounds 1 and 2 of the amended judicial review application before the Federal Magistrate. At the hearing before the Court, the applicant confirmed he intended to repeat those earlier grounds. In these circumstances it is clear that the applicant means to contend that the Federal Magistrate erred by not making those findings of law in her decision. However, in my view, no error is apparent in the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate. Her Honour explained in relation to ground 1 that the findings of the Tribunal concerning his conduct being in relation to high caste people, and in any event, that he was not a member of DMK, meant that his claim to refugee status could not succeed. I agree. In relation to ground 2, there was, as the Federal Magistrate found, no obligation to constitute a fresh hearing on the issues mentioned in the s 424A letter, as they were live issues raised at the earlier hearing. None were fresh determinative issues. As a result no error is discernible in the reasons of the Federal Magistrate or the Tribunal. CONCLUSION AND ORDER In these circumstances, leave should not be granted to file the appeal out of time as there is no prospect of success on an appeal. The application should be dismissed with costs to be taxed, if not agreed.

Associate: Dated: 2 November 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: Self Represented Counsel for the Respondents: Ms A Nanson Solicitor for the Respondents: Australian Government Solicitor Date of Hearing: 2 November 2009 Date of Judgment: 2 November 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1237.html","title":"09_1237.txt","id":"29"},{"snippet":"BUCHANAN J: The respondents to these proceedings, which were commenced by application and statement of claim filed on 2 October 2009, have filed a motion seeking to strike out part of the proceedings under s 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) (\"the Act\") and part of the statement of claim under O 11 r 16 of the Federal Court Rules (\"the Rules\"). No defence has yet been filed. The only evidence before the Court is an affidavit sworn by a solicitor acting for the respondents (Ms Pickford) and some documents exhibited to Ms Pickford at the time she swore the affidavit. Ms Pickford's affidavit was read in support of the motion, and the documents were tendered, without objection. There was no evidence in response by the applicant. The application which initiated the proceedings alleged breaches ss 52 and 53B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (\"the TP Act\") and breach of contract and sought damages in each respect. The factual summary which follows is distilled from the amended statement of claim. In late November 2007 the applicant met with the second respondent. At the meeting the second respondent made a series of representations to the applicant in connection with an offer of employment by the first respondent, of which the second respondent was the \"Governing Director\" with powers to appoint a Managing Director and determine the powers, duties and remuneration of that position. The offer of employment to the applicant was as Managing Director. The representations included statements to the following effect (paragraph 14 of the amended statement of claim): (a) the second respondent would ensure that the first respondent would pay the applicant a bonus at the end of each financial year to bring his remuneration from $800,000 per annum (the salary offered) to US$1.1 million (his then earnings); (b) the first respondent would proceed with a plan to make an Initial Public Offering of shares and allow the applicant a right of first refusal of between 5% and 10% of the issued shares in the first respondent; (c) the second respondent intended that the applicant should remain working with the first respondent until the end of the applicant's career; (d) the applicant would have the right to \"acquire equity\" in the first respondent; (e) the applicant would have full day to day control in the management, operation and decision-making of the first respondent. Based on those pleaded oral representations it was then pleaded (by paragraphs 15 to 19 of the amended statement of claim) that a series of further representations were to be implied. Speaking generally, it was pleaded that, as a result of the oral representations of the second respondent on behalf of the first respondent, the first respondent thereby implied that it had the present intention to do things to bring about the matters represented by the second respondent to the applicant at the meeting in late November 2007. It was then pleaded that the applicant was asked if he would accept employment on the basis of the representations, express and implied, and agreed to do so. The applicant commenced employment on 4 February 2008. He relocated to Sydney and, it was pleaded, terminated his existing engagement in Hong Kong and declined an alternative opportunity. The amended statement of claim referred to a subsequent written offer to the applicant about the terms of his employment. It was to that issue that the respondents' evidence on the motion was directed. Ms Pickford's evidence showed that on 18 March 2008 the first respondent made a written offer of employment as Managing Director to the applicant upon terms which were set out in the letter of offer. The written terms included the following: We are pleased to offer you the position of Managing Director for WIN Corporation and its related companies (the \"Company\"). The offer is open for your acceptance by your signature below. You will be employed by the Company to perform services under the terms and conditions set out below. Except as otherwise mutually agreed in writing, these terms and conditions supersede all others affecting your employment by the Company or its associates or related companies . ... Performance Bonus At the Company's discretion you will be entitled to receive a performance bonus calculated on a fiscal year basis by reference to performance milestones, market factors and other criteria determined by the Company. ... Stock Placement In the eventuality of an IPO listing for WIN Corporation or its related or ancillary companies or in the circumstances where WIN corporation or its related or ancillary companies becomes a listed entity you will have a Right of First Refusal (ROFR) to acquire any initial placement or other allocation of shares at terms of offer to be agreed between the Company, its advisors and the Board of Directors but on terms no less favourable than any other offer for the acquisition of shares to other parties made or to be made prior to or during the listing process. Date of Commencement and Term Your employment with the Company under the terms of this contract shall commence on February 4 th 2008. The parties agree that the term of this contract shall last for a period of 36 months (\"Term\") without prejudice to clause 10. For the avoidance of doubt, the earliest you may cease your employment with the Company is close of business on February 3 rd 2011. The Company will have an option to extend the Term for a period of 12 months from February 3 rd 2011. If the option to extend is exercised the Salary will be reviewed upwards by a minimum of 5%. ... Notice of Termination ... If the Company breaches clause 6 by terminating or attempting to terminate this contract (other than in accordance with clause 10) with effect before the expiration of the Term, the Company shall be liable, on demand, to pay forthwith to you liquidated damages equal to your salary and allowances in respect of the unexpired part of the Term or a lump sum payment equivalent to 12 months of your salary and allowances, whichever is the lesser, less any appropriate tax and statutory deductions required by law. ... To signify your acceptance of employment under the terms and conditions set out in this contract, please sign the copy of the contract enclosed and return the signed copy to the Executive Chairman of WIN Corporation. (Bold emphasis added. ) The applicant accepted the offer by executing, and dating 19 June 2008, the following acknowledgement: I have received a copy of this contract and have read and understood its contents. I accept that the contents of this contract constitutes all of the terms of my employment agreement with the Company and supersedes any prior agreement or understanding with the Company . I also understand tat [sic] any alteration will be subject to mutual agreement, except for any alternation [sic] made from time to time to the Company Employee Handbook and Business Conduct Policies in accordance with terms and conditions stated therein. (Emphasis added. ) Apart from the matters I have emphasised, the written terms I have extracted were inconsistent with any promise or assurance that the applicant would necessarily receive a bonus, that any bonus he might receive would be of a certain amount, that the first respondent guaranteed there would be an Initial Public Offering of shares or that the applicant would have the right, or was expected, to remain in employment with the first respondent for the rest of his working life. The amended statement of claim made reference to a number of the written terms I have set out but made no reference to that part of the offer which referred to the terms and conditions offered superseding \"all others\" or to the applicant's executed acknowledgment to that effect. The amended statement of claim, to the contrary, pleaded that the contract made by acceptance of the written offer of 18 March 2008 included the express and implied representations alleged to have been made in November 2007. Moreover, it was pleaded that each express and implied representation prevailed over any written term to the extent of any inconsistency between them. Accordingly, it was pleaded (paragraph 36 of the amended statement of claim) that, notwithstanding the written terms set out above (and the contingencies, discretions and reservation of control to the first respondent therein contained), the contract between the parties required that: (a) the applicant be paid a bonus to augment his remuneration to the level promised; (b) any discretion to grant a performance bonus be exercised in favour of the applicant; (c) the IPO listing would proceed and the applicant would be entitled to shares as promised; (d) the employment contract would be extended as promised (presumably to the end of his career). It was also pleaded (paragraph 37 of the statement of claim) that the first respondent was estopped from relying solely upon the terms of the contract resulting from the written offer because the applicant, before the written offer was made and relying on the express and implied representations, had already: terminated his earlier engagement; declined an alternative opportunity; relocated his wife and family from overseas; commenced his employment and it was asserted: Neither the First nor the Second Respondent informed the Applicant at that time that the Express and Implied Representations ceased to have operation upon the execution of the Second Employment Contract. In light of the evidence to which I have already referred this last assertion of fact was untenable. I understand it to be accepted that no regard should be paid to it. The amended statement of claim thereafter made a series of factual assertions to the effect, again speaking generally, that the matters represented were not honoured. At times there were specific accusations of particular behaviour by the second respondent from which it was apparently intended an inference should be drawn that he (and the first respondent) had never intended the representations would be honoured. Some of those matters will later require attention. Based on the allegations to which I have referred, the amended statement of claim first pleaded breach of the TP Act and then breach of the contract of employment made as a result of the offer and acceptance dated 18 March 2008 and 19 June 2008 respectively (incorporating the express and implied representations). There were allegations of breach both of the written terms of the contract and of the express and implied representations said to be part of that contract. There were also allegations of breach of terms of the contract of employment required to be implied by law, such as asserted implied terms of \"good faith\" and \"trust and confidence\". The respondents' motion, as pressed at the hearing, seeks to strike out only so much of the proceedings as attempt to raise, or rely upon, a cause of action based on breach of contract by failure to observe any alleged express or implied representations (s 31A of the Act) and also many paragraphs of the statement of claim (and the amended statement of claim) which, it was argued, did not plead material facts relevant to the pleaded causes of action as required by the Rules (O 11 r 16). Before I turn to the particular arguments, and responses, made about these issues I need to make some general points about the operation of s 31A of the Act. Section 31A, as relevant to the present matter, provides: 31A (1) ... (2) The Court may give judgment for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceeding if: (a) the first party is defending the proceeding or that part of the proceeding; and (b) the Court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceeding or that part of the proceeding. (3) For the purposes of this section, a defence or a proceeding or part of a proceeding need not be: (a) hopeless; or (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. It is clear from its own terms that s 31A is concerned with the summary disposition of proceedings, not of pleadings. It is necessary for the Court to come to a view about the reasonable prospects of the proceedings, or part of them, ultimately succeeding and it is clear from the authorities that any assessment of that issue should look beyond mere deficiencies in the pleadings. That may not always be easy to do. In the present case I have been asked to rule on the respondents' motion at a time when the pleadings are incomplete, there is no evidence in support of the application itself and only such evidence as the parties have chosen to advance on the motion. There is an undoubted discretion whether to deal with the present motion at once or at some later stage in the proceedings when the issues, legal and factual, have been more clearly defined (see e.g. Luck v University of Southern Queensland [2009] FCAFC 73 ; (2009) 176 FCR 268 ( \"Luck\" ) at [58], [111]). Subject to such a possibility I see no alternative to dealing with a motion such as the present by reference to the material before the Court, such as it is, even if incomplete. As the respondents point out, they are entitled to bring their motion even though they have not yet filed their defences and there is no evidence before the Court in support of the application itself ( Kowalski v MMAL Staff Superannuation Fund Pty Ltd (2009) 178 FCR 401 at [72]-[74] ( \"Kowalski\" )). The fact that an application under s 31A for summary dismissal of all or part of a proceeding may be made before a defence or any evidence has been filed gives rise to potential tension between the rights of the parties. On the one hand, s 31A is not activated by mere deficiencies in the pleadings. There must be attention to substance, rather than just to form, bearing in mind the possibility that some amendment to the pleadings may be available to identify or support a cause of action, or defence, presently absent or deficient (see e.g. White Industries Aust Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [2007] FCA 511 ; (2007) 160 FCR 298 at [47] and [59]). On the other hand, a party moving for summary dismissal must be entitled to an assessment of the position disclosed by the pleadings in their current state together with any evidence in the proceedings or on the motion. Such a party is no doubt entitled to resist the prospect that the Court will speculate unduly about the prospects for rectification of the pleadings. In some cases the appropriate path between the two priorities may not be an easy one to identify. Another matter to be borne in mind is that, despite some debate in the earlier authorities about the issue, I am bound by the view that summary dismissal under s 31A of the Act is an interlocutory, rather than final, exercise of judicial power ( Kowalski at [43]; see also Luck ). Three consequences follow: I have decided the issues are sufficiently clear to proceed. In particular, I am satisfied that, having regard to the substance of the applicant's pleaded case, the respondents are entitled to challenge the foundation for the assertions made about the terms of the contract upon which the applicant has sued and the relief claimed as a result. The respondents claim, in light of the uncontradicted evidence they have produced, showing the written offer of 18 March 2008 and executed acceptance dated 19 June 2008, that the asserted express or implied representations were not incorporated into the applicant's current contract of employment and they are not estopped from so arguing. In substance, the respondents contend that so much of the applicant's claims as to breach of contract as proceed upon the assertion that the asserted express and implied representations were terms of the contract, or claims for damages as a result of alleged breach, cannot possibly succeed. Execution of a written contract reveals the mutual intention of the parties. That intention is to be identified objectively. The terms of such a contract may not be construed by reference to the subjective understandings or intentions of one of the parties or even all of the parties. Rather, such written terms must be given a meaning, attributed to them objectively, as they would be understood by a reasonable person in the same position (see Secured Income Real Estate (Australia) Ltd v St Martins Investments Pty Ltd [1979] HCA 51 ; (1979) 144 CLR 596 at 606; Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 ( \"Codelfa\" ) at 352; Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] - [23] ; Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 ( \"Toll\" ) at [40]). In Toll the High Court also observed (at [45]): [45] It should not be overlooked that to sign a document known and intended to affect legal relations is an act which itself ordinarily conveys a representation to a reasonable reader of the document. The representation is that the person who signs either has read and approved the contents of the document or is willing to take the chance of being bound by those contents, as Latham CJ put it, whatever they might be. That representation is even stronger where the signature appears below a perfectly legible written request to read the document before signing it. That legal framework may not deny to the applicant an argument that, notwithstanding the execution of the written contract, it was supplemented by further oral terms or the respondents were estopped from denying that it was. However, any such contention would require the identification of factual matters adequate to support it. The applicant placed particular weight on observations by Allsop J in Branir Pty Ltd v Owston Nominees (No 2) Pty Ltd [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 where (at [444]-[448]) his Honour discussed, and doubted, the contention that the equitable doctrine of estoppel could not \"outflank\" an \"entire agreement clause\" (which the respondents assert the written contract in the present case clearly contains). If disposition of the present motion turned upon competing views about that issue I would have no hesitation in allowing the issue to be resolved at trial, based on all the evidence and a full discussion of the relevant law. However, the problem for the applicant is a more basic one. The applicant did not argue that the asserted express and implied representations should be implied as additional terms. Such an argument could not have survived the requirement that implied terms may not contradict express terms (see BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings (1977) 180 CLR 266 at 283; Codelfa at 347). Rather, the applicant's position was that the asserted express and implied representations should be taken to have been directly incorporated into the contract or, at least, that the respondents were estopped from denying that was so. On that approach, any tension or inconsistency between the written terms and the additional, incorporated terms was to be resolved as a matter of overall construction. However, I see nothing in the amended statement of claim which pleads matters of fact which are sufficient to sustain an allegation that the parties mutually intended that the asserted express and implied representations were to be incorporated into the applicant's current employment contract. I do not see factual allegations either which, if established, would show that the dealings between the parties raised an estoppel about that issue in favour of the applicant. I shall attempt to explain each of those observations in slightly greater detail. I do not understand how, on any view, the so-called implied representations could have any effect inconsistent with, or contrary to, the express terms of the contract. They could not be other than implied terms of any contract but they could not survive the legal tests for implication, apart from all other difficulties. And, as the respondents point out, there is no suggestion in the amended statement of claim that any representations made in November 2007 (express or implied) were reiterated in connection with the written offer made on 18 March 2008. No facts were pleaded which would support a contention that the parties mutually intended that any such terms should be incorporated at the same time the written contract was made. So far as their intentions are to be judged by their conduct in executing the written terms, the opposite conclusion is required. The pleaded position in the amended statement of claim rose no higher than an assertion that the applicant, for his part, continued to rely on the suggested representations when he signed the acceptance dated 19 June 2008, as he had when he initially accepted employment. Making that assumption in his favour, that draws attention only to a circumstance that the authorities direct must not be used to construe the terms of a contract, namely the beliefs or aspirations of a party. It follows that there is no reasonable prospect that either the asserted oral representations or the asserted implied representations could be found, as a matter of law or fact, to be part of the applicant's current contract of employment based on the assertions of material fact in the amended statement of claim. So far as reliance on the doctrine of estoppel is concerned, the position is no better for the applicant. No facts are pleaded which would sustain a contention that, by their conduct in connection with the offer made on 18 March 2008, the respondents induced the applicant to accept the offer to his detriment. The pleaded position relies on the circumstances in which the applicant accepted the initial offer of employment, namely terminating his existing engagement, declining an alternative offer and relocating to Australia with his family. Those things had already occurred. They did not occur again in reliance upon the written offer of 18 March 2008. If there was any detriment flowing to the applicant from conduct of the respondents in connection with the offer of 18 March 2002 it had to be identified, in my view, by reference to the circumstances of the applicant at 19 June 2008 when he accepted the offer. Furthermore, it was necessary to identify some specific conduct of the respondents upon which he relied in that regard. Referring only to the written offer did not introduce, much less sustain, an assumption that the applicant was entitled to rely on all that had gone before without regard to the terms then being offered to him. As a matter of law he was not obliged to accept those terms. No facts were pleaded which would suggest a contrary conclusion. Accordingly, I see no prospect that the applicant can succeed, on the facts at present pleaded, in establishing that the respondents are estopped from arguing that the terms of the contract identified in the amended statement of claim are the written terms only. I am satisfied, therefore, that so much of the proceedings as purports to raise a cause of action for damages for breach of contract based upon asserted contractual terms identified by paragraph 21 of the amended statement of claim as \"the Express Representations\" and \"the Implied Representations\" has no reasonable prospects of success and should be dismissed pursuant to s 31A of the Act. I emphasise that this conclusion is based upon the facts pleaded, the evidence advanced by the respondents and the absence of any evidence from the applicant addressed to the matters I have mentioned which might suggest the real possibility of a further relevant amendment to the amended statement of claim. I will hear the parties further on what should be done to give effect to my conclusions. Some of the matters pleaded in connection with the suggested representations concern claims under the TP Act. I do not intend that those claims should be affected. However, there are some paragraphs of the amended statement of claim which seem to have no independent relevance and my tentative view is that they should be struck out to give effect to my conclusions. They are paragraphs 33 to 37 and 80 to 83. I should note that although paragraphs 80(b) and 82(b) in part plead breach of the written terms it appears to me that such allegations are unsustainable by reference to the terms themselves and depend upon the suggestion in paragraph 36 (which I propose should be struck out) that the written terms were to \"operate\" in a manner affected by the representations. The remaining issue for attention concerns whether specified paragraphs of the amended statement of claim plead material facts, and only material facts, as required by the Rules (O 11 r 2(a)). I referred earlier to the fact that there were a number of allegations made about the respondents. They included accusations about the conduct of the second respondent. He was alleged, variously, to have acted erratically, made false and misleading statements to the Board of the first respondent, disparaged the applicant in public, advised business representatives not to deal with the applicant and told the applicant he \"wanted him out\". The applicant's answer to the criticisms that these were not \"material\" facts was to suggest that the conduct of the second respondent supported an inference that at the time the representations were made in November 2007 they were known to be false. The connection is a very slender one. Some of the conduct asserted did not occur until September 2009. Nevertheless, the assertions are relied upon in connection with causes of action arising under the TP Act where one issue will be whether (accepting the representations were made) there were reasonable grounds for the representations pleaded. I am not satisfied at the moment that the facts alleged are not, and will not be, material. That is an issue which can be raised again if it is productive and sensible to do so. For the moment I will not strike out any of paragraphs 39(e), 43 --- 46, 47 --- 51, 52, 53, 54, 55 --- 57, 59, 60 or 61 as sought. There are other paragraphs which make allegations about the financial performance of the first respondent, and the contribution to it of the applicant, to which objection is also taken. Those paragraphs were also defended on the basis that they support an inference that certain of the suggested representations were false or untrue at the time they were made. Again, I am not persuaded as things stand that they should be struck out. I will not strike out any of paragraphs 40, 41 or 62 --- 64 as sought. The respondents are to provide draft orders to the Court and the applicant to give effect to the substance of my conclusions. I will hear the parties further about the precise form of the orders which should be made. The respondents have sought an opportunity to be heard on the costs of the motion. I will hear the parties about that issue, if necessary, after receipt of written submissions from each side. The pleadings should be completed and evidence should be prepared. The applicant's case depends on recollection of oral exchanges and criticism of the second respondent's conduct. All such matters are likely to be controversial. I have in mind at the moment that evidence should be given orally, upon notice to the other side but without being filed in court in advance. The parties are to confer, and attempt to agree, on an efficient timetable for the future disposition of the proceedings including completion of the pleadings, the exchange between themselves of outlines of intended evidence and the exchange of submissions about the costs of the motion if that is necessary in light of the fact that each side had a measure of success. I will take a report about all these matters at 9.30 am on 5 February 2010, or such other time as may be arranged with my Associate. For the moment I will adjourn the proceedings to that time and date. I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Buchanan.

The second respondent, the Bombala Council, requested at the time I published my judgment that I vacate my proposed order as to costs as it wished to seek indemnity costs in the matter. The Council puts its claim for indemnity costs on two bases. The first relies upon the discretion the Court has to depart from the usual principles informing the judicial discretion to award costs where the circumstances of the case warrant such a departure: see Re Wilcox: Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Ltd (1996) 141 ALR 727 at 732-734. The second relies upon an offer of compromise being made under O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules , it being contended that, the application having been dismissed summarily, Mr Wilkshire obtained a result less favourable than the terms of the offer of compromise dated 4 June 2009 which was made to him. I can deal with the second of these grounds shortly. In my view there is reason for a court to be slow to allow indemnity costs to be obtained under O 23 r 11 in circumstances in which the relevant order obtained (against which the Order 23 r 11 comparison is to be made) is an order for summary dismissal. I do not consider it to be a policy of O 23 to provide a successful party as of course with the forensic advantage of indemnity costs when involved in proceedings with another whose case is hopeless and doomed to failure. For my own part I would be reluctant to order indemnity costs pursuant to O 23 r 11 on a motion for summary dismissal unless an award of indemnity costs is itself warranted by the principles informing the judicial discretion to award such costs. It is unnecessary for present purposes to enlarge upon those principles. Some number of them were expounded by Sheppard J in Colgate-Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 536 ; (1993) 46 FCR 225 at 232-233; see also Re Wilcox ; and see generally Dal Pont, Law of Costs [16.39] ff (2 nd ed, 2009). The above is the approach I intend taking in this case. The Present Case It is not the case that because a person is a lay litigant he or she is for that reason immune to an order for indemnity costs: see Ogawa v The University of Melbourne (No 2) [2004] FCA 1275 at [41] - [47] ; Bhagat v Global Custodians Ltd [2002] FCA 223 at [55]-[60]. This said, there is an understandable reluctance to make such orders unless clear and compelling reasons for doing so are present notwithstanding the litigant's lack of legal representation. I have set out at length in my reasons in the principal proceeding, the long history of the dispute between Mr Wilkshire and the Council. They have near identical trade marks differentiated in appearance for practical purposes by the language on them. They do relate to different classes of use. For whatever reason, Mr Wilkshire is of the view that the Council's registration of its mark was wrongly obtained. When the Council applied for registration of its mark in 2003 he opposed that application unsuccessfully. He then appealed to the Federal Court alleging, as he had before to the delegate, that those who had given evidence for the Council had colluded and fabricated evidence for the purposes of the application. Mr Wilkshire had legal advice in making his application to the Federal Court. His counsel provided advice that his appeal was unlikely to succeed. Subsequently consent orders were made which, amongst other things, noted a contractual arrangement between Mr Wilkshire and the Council which was designed to end their dispute over the Council's mark then and thereafter. He in effect agreed not to initiate any form of action against the Council in relation to the use of the respondent's mark. Shortly before the consent orders, Mr Wilkshire filed five new trade mark applications all similar in character to his original marks. The Council became aware of this and opposed their registration. Before the opposition hearing Mr Wilkshire commenced the present proceeding. The delegate, in refusing to register Mr Wilkshire's five applications accepted that for s 62A of the Trade Marks Act the application was made in bad faith. As I have indicated, Mr Wilkshire's application to this Court for cancellation of the mark under s 88 of the Act asserted that registration had been obtained as a result of fraud, false suggestion and misrepresentation by the Council and the delegate of the Registrar. In ordering summary dismissal I did so on a variety of grounds. The first was that he was not \"a person aggrieved\" for s 88 purposes. The second was that in any event his application did not on its face enliven a ground upon which an order could be made under s 88. The third was that in any event his contractual undertakings with the Council as part of the consent orders was a complete answer to his application. In my reasons I observed that (at [41]) that: Mr Wilkshire's affidavits are replete with speculations about, and assertions and allegations of, impropriety, be it of the Delegate, the Council's witnesses, or both parties' lawyers. While accepting he may be able to point to inconsistencies in evidence relating to events long prior to the preparation of the declarations of witnesses for the Council, or to the non-production of documents created over a decade earlier, he has provided no plausible justification at all for the regularly made and, at first flush, seemingly preposterous consequential allegations of impropriety. I note in passing the standard of proof s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) provides for such allegations: see Qantas Airways Ltd v Gama [2008] FCAFC 69 at [123] - [139] . There clearly is evidence before me of a refusal by Mr Wilkshire to accept the Council's entitlement to have and to use its mark. There equally is evidence that notwithstanding he was an unrepresented litigant, save in his appeal to the Federal Court, he has received advice or information from a variety of sources which would have communicated to a reasonable person that the present proceeding had no reasonable chance of success. I refer both to the decisions of the two delegates in the opposition hearings, albeit these were proceedings of a quasi summary nature, to his counsel's advice before the Federal Court appeal and, as well, to the terms of the offer of compromise made to him by the Council to the extent that it attempted to explain why his cancellation application was bound to fail. Importantly, that letter drew attention to the contractual undertakings to which I have referred. It also indicated that his allegations of deliberate dishonesty by the Council's witnesses required strong evidence for their proof and that his evidence fell well short of that. Mr Wilkshire's intent to prosecute his proceeding, such advice notwithstanding is manifest in his attempt to disavow his contractual undertaking not to initiate legal proceedings against the Council. When one turns to ask the question whether there are unusual circumstances in this matter which would justify an award of indemnity costs in relation to the motion for summary dismissal, I am satisfied such is the case. Notwithstanding the considerable latitude to be given to a lay litigant, I consider Mr Wilkshire has transgressed the borders of indulgence. He has without restraint over quite some period of time made allegations of impropriety against all who appear to support the Council or whose actions or advice stand in the way of his securing his ends. Further, as I indicated in the passage quoted above, he has provided no plausible justification at all for seemingly preposterous allegations of impropriety. He has been unprepared to honour the undertaking he gave to the Council not to initiate litigation in respect of its use of its registered mark. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that he will continue to vex the Council unless the Court's disapproval of his conduct of litigation such as the present is brought home to him. In the circumstances I consider that an award of indemnity costs is appropriate accordingly. Having dismissed Mr Wilkshire's application, I will order that the he pay the second respondent's costs on an indemnity costs basis (including its costs of the motions of 19 June 2009 and of 21 September 2009).

On 17 December 2009 I made the orders that appear at the front of these reasons, confirming both Schemes subject to satisfaction of the condition referred to in them by 31 December 2009. The reasons why I made the orders on 17 December 2009 are found in the Earlier Reasons and these present reasons. By the Insurance Scheme, the direct insurance business of Westport's Australian branch was to be transferred to the Australian branch of Swiss Re International SE (I will refer to the company as SRI and to its Australian branch as SRIAU). By the Reinsurance Scheme, the reinsurance business of Westport's Australian branch was to be transferred to the Australian branch of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (I will refer to the company as SRC and to its Australian branch as SRCAU). There is confusion in the papers concerning the addition or omission of \"AU\". Because I will be recounting things stated in the papers, it is impossible to avoid all ambiguity below. It must be remembered, however, that while the Australian branches are important for APRA and actuarial purposes, the legal entities are the bodies corporate themselves. Westport, SRI and SRC are all incorporated in foreign countries and are registered in Australia as foreign companies. Westport, SRI and SRC are all foreign general insurers as defined in s 3 of the Act because they are all (a) foreign corporations within the meaning of s 51(xx) of the Constitution ; (b) authorised to carry on insurance business in a foreign country; and (c) authorised under s 12 of the Act to carry on insurance business in Australia. The expression \"insurance business\" is defined in s 3 of the Act. The expression \"general insurer\" is defined to mean a body corporate that is authorised under s 12 of the Act to carry on insurance business in Australia (ss 3 , 11 of the Act). A foreign general insurer is therefore a species of general insurer. Westport is a member of the Swiss Re group of companies. Westport's Australian branch has both general insurance and reinsurance liabilities. Other members of the Swiss Re group with Australian branches are SRI and SRC. The Schemes are propounded principally in order to effect an internal reorganisation of the Australian operations of the Swiss Re group. Following the implementation of the Schemes, the general insurance business of Swiss Re in Australia will be conducted by SRI through SRIAU, and the reinsurance business of Swiss Re in Australia will be conducted by SRC through SRCAU. All of Westport's policyholders will be \"transferred\" from Westport (which, as at 30 June 2009, and if adjusted to take into account a capital reduction in September 2009, had a solvency ratio of 158%) either to SRI (SRIAU is projected to have a solvency ratio of 191%) or to SCR (SRCAU is projected to have a solvency ratio of 160%) (see [67] below), according to whether their policies are in the nature of direct insurance or reinsurance respectively. The Schemes have the support of Westport's appointed actuary. Australian branches of foreign general insurers An Australian \"branch\" of a foreign general insurer is a notional entity representing the assets and liabilities of that company in Australia. The branch is not a legal entity. However, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is concerned only with the Australian branch and with the protection of the holders of policies issued by the Australian branch. There is a general requirement under the Act (s 28) that general insurers maintain \"in Australia\" assets of a value equal to or greater than the value of their liabilities \"in Australia\". Other provisions of the Act also express the test of ability to meet a general insurer's liabilities in Australia from its asset in Australia: see ss 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE. The meaning of assets and liabilities in Australia is refined and elaborated upon in s 116A of the Act. Prudential Standards require foreign general insurers to maintain assets in Australia in excess of their liabilities in Australia in an amount at least equal to a variant of a certain Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR) (see Prudential Standard GPS 110 Capital Adequacy , esp para 11). Foreign general insurers must therefore maintain a separate balance sheet in respect of their Australian operations in order to depict the financial condition of the Australian branch. This notional division between a foreign general insurer's Australian operations and its other operations is reinforced by restrictions that APRA places on a foreign general insurer's liberty to deal with its assets in Australia. It may not reduce its assets in Australia (save to the extent of repatriation, to a certain extent, of current year profits) without APRA's approval. The companies involved Westport Westport is incorporated in Missouri, USA. It commenced writing insurance and reinsurance business in Australia through a branch in 1996. Westport was acquired by SRC in 2006. Following the acquisition, Westport ceased to write reinsurance business, focussing instead on commercial insurance. The reinsurance portfolio is in \"run-off\". As at 31 December 2008, Westport's insurance liabilities were approximately 18% direct insurance, and 82% reinsurance. Claims made on Westport are currently handled by SRC's claims division. As at 30 June 2009, on an APRA accounting basis, Westport's Australian branch had total assets of $529,232,159, and total liabilities of $314,027,590, giving a net asset position of $215,204,569. (The position on an ASIC accounting basis is only slightly different, with a net asset position of $212,813,775). As at 30 June 2009, after taking into account a subsequent capital reduction, Westport has been calculated to have had assets equal to 158% of its MCR. SRC SRC is incorporated in Switzerland. It is a large, global, general, life and health reinsurer. SRC has 54 offices in 34 countries and employs approximately 10,000 people worldwide. In the financial year ended 31 December 2008, SRC made a net loss of CHF 0.9 billion. As at 31 December 2008 it had total assets of CHF 239.9 billion, and total liabilities of CHF219.4 billion, giving a net asset position of CHF 20.5 billion. SRC is rated A+ (stable) by Standard & Poor's, A1 (good) by Moody's, and A (excellent) by AM Best. SRC has carried on business in Australia through its branch, SRCAU, since 1956. As at 31 December 2008, on an APRA accounting basis, SRCAU had total assets of $2,285,137, and total liabilities of $1,806,403, giving a net asset position of $478,734. As at 31 December 2008, SRCAU held assets equal to 167% of its MCR. As at 30 June 2009, that solvency coverage had increased to 182%, primarily because no funds have been repatriated out of SRCAU since 31 December 2008. SRI SRI is a Luxembourg company. SRI has not previously conducted business in Australia. In 2009, APRA authorised SRI to carry on a new and renewal insurance business in Australia through an Australian branch, subject to a condition that it not issue any policies until 1 January 2010. SRI does not have any employees in Australia. Its operations are (and will be) conducted by employees of SRC, pursuant to services agreements. The legislative framework Section 17B(1) of the Act provides that no part of a general insurer's business may be transferred to another general insurer or amalgamated with the business of another general insurer except pursuant to a scheme confirmed by this Court. This provision is subject to an exception provided for in subs (4). Subsections (1) and (4) are discussed further below. Section 17E(1) (read in conjunction with s 17A) provides that any party or proposed party to a transfer scheme may apply to the Court for confirmation of the scheme. Such an application cannot be made until the steps outlined in s 17C(2) have been taken. The application must be made in accordance with the prudential standards (s 17E(2)). Section 17F(1) provides that the Court may confirm the scheme, either as presented or as modified by the Court, or refuse to confirm the scheme. Preconditions to making an application Steps required to be taken prior to the \"making\" of an application need only be taken prior to the time at which the Court is moved for the order of confirmation of the scheme, not prior to the filing of the application in the Court registry: Re Armstrong Jones Life Assurance Limited (1997) 74 FCR 160 at 163, per Emmett J; Re Royal & Sun Alliance Life Assurance Ltd [2000] FCA 1259 ; (2000) 104 FCR 37 at 39, per Katz J; Re Insurance Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 524 ; (2004) 139 FCR 450 ( Re Insurance Australia Ltd ) at [30] --- [37], per Lindgren J. A reading of s 17C(2) of the Act with Prudential Standard GPS 410 --- Transfer and Amalgamation of Insurance Business for General Insurers discloses that the following steps must be taken before an application for confirmation is made. (a) The applicant must provide a copy of the scheme and of any actuarial report on which it is based to APRA: s 17C(2)(a). That must be done before the steps outlined at (d) and (e) below are taken: Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 5. The Schemes were first provided to APRA on 4 November 2009. Drafts of the actuarial reports in respect of the Schemes were provided to APRA on 26 October 2009. (b) The applicant must obtain APRA's approval of its summary of the scheme (Scheme Summary) before the step outlined at (d) below is taken: Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 8. APRA approved the Scheme Summaries on 12 November 2009. (c) The applicant must obtain APRA's approval of its notice of intention to make the application: Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 9. APRA approved the notices of intention on 12 November 2009. (d) The applicant must publish a notice of intention to make the application: s 17C(2)(b). That notice must contain the information specified in Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 10. The notice must be published in (a) the Government Gazette , and (b) one or more newspapers approved by APRA circulating in each State and Territory in which an affected policyholder resides: Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 9. The notice must be published before the step outlined at (f) below is taken: Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 11. APRA required that, in addition to publication in the Government Gazette , the notice of intention be published in The Australian and The Australian Financial Review . The present notices of intention (which were approved by APRA on 12 November 2009) were published once in each of those publications on 17 November 2009 (in the Government Gazette ) and on 19 November 2009 (in The Australian Financial Review and The Australian ). (e) The applicant must give to every affected policyholder a copy of the Scheme Summary. This requirement was waived by my order made on 13 November 2009 on condition that certain other steps were taken as outlined below. (f) The applicant must make a copy of the scheme available for public inspection from 9.00 a.m. until 5.00 p.m. every day (except weekends and public holidays) for a period of at least 15 days at an office of the applicant or some other location approved by APRA in each State and Territory in which an affected policyholder resides: Prudential Standard GPS 410 , para 16. The inspection period in this case ran from 20 November 2009 to 11 December 2009, and copies of the Schemes were made available at locations approved by APRA being various offices of Allens Arthur Robinson, the solicitors for Westport, or of other firms appointed by them for the purpose. The additional steps required to be taken by the applicant in this case by the Court's orders of 13 November 2009 were as follows: (a) in relation to the Insurance Scheme, Westport was required to send a copy of the Scheme Summary by pre-paid post to: all policyholders of Westport identified by the searches referred to in the affidavit of Karen Lancaster read in support of the application, and for whom Westport had an address; MGA Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd, AssetInsure Pty Ltd, Australis Group Underwriting, Howard Insurance Australia Pty Ltd, SRS Underwriting Agency, Dexta Corporation Pty Ltd and Gallagher Broking Services. (b) in relation to the Reinsurance Scheme, Westport was required to send a copy of the Scheme Summary by pre-paid post to: all policyholders of Westport identified by the searches referred to in the affidavit of Xenia Zumbach-Hauenstein read in support of the application, and for whom Westport had an address; all insurers authorised with APRA listed in the \"List of Authorised Insurers\" maintained by APRA as at 13 November 2009. Evidence was read at the hearing on 17 December 2009 demonstrating compliance with the requirements mentioned at [29] and [30] above. The discretion to confirm the scheme A review of some of the decided cases (including cases decided under similar provisions of the Life Insurance Act 1995 (Cth)) suggests that, in general terms, the Court has treated the critical factor governing the exercise of its discretion as being whether \"policyholders\" will be materially detrimentally affected by the implementation of the scheme: Re Insurance Australia Ltd at [76]; In the matter of GIO Personal Investment Services Ltd and AMP Life Ltd [2000] FCA 1871 at [27] . The expression \"affected policyholder\" is defined and used in s 17C of the Act. That section is concerned with steps to be taken before the application for confirmation is made. In Re Insurance Australia Ltd , I held at [19]-[24] that an \"affected policyholder\" within the meaning of s 17C is a holder of a policy being transferred under the scheme. Accordingly, in the present case it is the policyholders of Westport who are \"affected policyholders\" for the purposes of s 17C of the Act. I also held, however, that this does not mean that the effect that the scheme will have on other policyholders is irrelevant to the exercise of the Court's discretion: Re Insurance Australia Ltd at [25]. SRIAU has no existing policyholders (see [22] above), but SRCAU does (see [20]-[21] above). The Court's discretion to confirm a scheme for the transfer of an insurance business is conferred by s 17F. In In the matter of Reward Insurance Ltd [2004] FCA 151 , Heerey J observed (at [3]) that the discretion was a general one and that the Act did not specify any criteria that were to be considered. His Honour described as \"a prime consideration\" the nature of the actual and potential claims to which the transferor insurer is subject and the financial viability of the transferee insurer ( ibid ). In Re MDU Australian Insurance Co Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 490 , Emmett J identified (at [7]) \"[t]he critical consideration\" as being whether the affected policyholders would be detrimentally affected. His Honour also said (at [9]) that the interests of the existing policyholders of the transferee insurer must be considered. Earlier, in Mercantile & General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd [2004] FCA 1773 , his Honour had raised (at [23]) the question of the desirability of legislative amendment to make consideration of the interests of the latter mandatory (but see [44] below). The position must now be considered in the light of s 17F(1A) of the Act. Subsection (1A) was inserted into s 17F by the Financial System Legislation Amendment (Financial Claims Scheme and Other Measures) Act 2008 (Cth) (No 105, 2008), s 3 Schedule 3, Item 7. Subsection (1A) provides: In deciding whether to confirm a scheme (with or without modifications), the Federal Court must have regard to: (a) the interests of the policyholders of a body corporate affected by the scheme; and (b) if a report relevant to all or part of the scheme has been filed with the Court under section 62ZI---that report; and (c) any other matter the Court considers relevant. Paragraph (b) has no application in the present case. The present application for confirmation has raised an important question, namely, whether para (a) of the new subs (1A) of s 17F encompasses the interests of the holders of policies issued otherwise than as part of the business of an Australian branch. In other words, must the Court have regard to the interests of the holders of policies issued in any of its branches anywhere in the world by a foreign general insurer that is affected by the scheme? The argument in favour of a positive answer to this question depends on what may be described as a \"literal\" construction of para (a) of s 17F(1A). In the present case, the bodies corporate that are affected by the Insurance Scheme are Westport (incorporated in Missouri) and SRI (incorporated in Luxemburg), and the bodies corporate that are affected by the Reinsurance Scheme are Westport (incorporated in Missouri) and SRC (incorporated in Switzerland). All three bodies corporate have written insurance business overseas. It could be argued that the interests of the holders of policies issued as part of the business of an overseas branch of any of these insurers are indirectly \"affected\" by the Schemes even though the Schemes directly affect only the interests of the holders of policies issued by the Australian branches. It should be acknowledged at the outset that the literal construction referred to is at odds with the Act's concern with Australian branches; would give rise to inconvenience; and was almost certainly not intended. On the question of inconvenience, the Court was informed, and in any event takes judicial notice of the fact, that global insurers are likely to have many branches located in several and possibly many countries, and thousands and possibly tens or even hundreds of thousands of policyholders. For example, the Court was informed that \"Swiss Re operates in over 35 different countries\", while \"the Australian branch of Swiss Re Insurance Company Ltd represents only approximately 2.5% of Swiss Re Insurance Ltd's global premium income and claims liabilities\". If subsection (1A) requires the Court to have regard to the interests of policyholders world wide, it may be necessary on applications for confirmation of a scheme to have actuarial evidence relating to the interests of the policyholders of overseas branches and of the legislative or regulatory requirements (or both) applicable in each overseas jurisdiction in which the body corporate operates. It is difficult to accept that this is what the Parliament intended. I would so construe para (a) of the new subsection (1A) of s 17F in this way only if constrained to do so. Neither my own researches nor those of Westport's legal representatives or of APRA (which exercised its right to be heard under s 17E(3) of the Act) have revealed any statement in the Explanatory Memorandum or the Parliamentary Debates associated with the Bill for Act No 105 of 2008 that throws any light on the intended scope of para (a). An intention that might suggest itself is that of making mandatory a consideration that this Court was already at liberty to take into account and has taken into account, namely, the interests of non-transferred (remaining) Australian branch policyholders of the transferor insurer, and existing (continuing) Australian branch policyholders of the transferee insurer, neither of which categories would fall within s 17C's concept of \"affected policyholder\": see Re Insurance Australia Ltd, above at [25], [70], [75], [76]; Mercantile & General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd , above, at [23]; PMI Indemnity Ltd [2005] FCA 1842 at [25] ff; Re Calliden Group Ltd [2007] FCA 2019 at [90] - [91] . Importantly, in no case has the Court had regard to the interests of policyholders of an overseas branch or discussed the desirability of their being considered. In Mercantile & General Reinsurance Company of Australia Ltd, above, for example, Emmett J referred to the effect of a scheme on the Australian branch policyholders of the transferee foreign general insurer, and not the policyholders of its overseas branches. His Honour also said (at [3]) that the non-Australian assets and liabilities of the transferee foreign general insurer could be ignored. Justice Emmett's comment relating to the desirability of legislative amendment to which I referred at [34] above is to be understood against the background of the fact that his Honour took into account the interests of only the Australian branch policyholders of the transferee foreign general insurer. It seems a fair summary to say that in all applications for confirmation involving foreign general insurers, the parties and the Court have treated the interests of policyholders of branches other than Australian branches as a consideration irrelevant to the exercise of the discretion under s 17F of the Act. The literal construction of para (a) of s 17F(1A) would therefore mark a fundamental change. Section 17A, the first section within Div 3A of Pt III of the Act, provides that a reference in that division to \"a body corporate affected by a scheme\" is a reference to a body corporate that is a party or proposed party to an agreement or deed by which the transfer or amalgamation provided for in the scheme is, or is to be, carried out. The present Schemes identify the parties as the respective Australian branches, but it seems clear that it is the three legal entities that are the parties to the two Schemes. In my opinion it is not possible to construe the expression \"the policyholders of a body corporate affected by the scheme\" in s 17F(1A)(a) as simply the plural number of \"affected policyholder\" in s 17C, subs (1) of which defines that expression as \"the holder of a policy affected by a scheme\". Parliament would have used the expression \"affected policyholders\" if that had been its intention. Similarly, it is not possible, in my view, to read para (a) as referring to [policyholders of a body corporate] [affected by the scheme] and so to make the definition in s 17A irrelevant. Rather, the paragraph refers to [policyholders of] [a body corporate affected by the scheme], and s 17A's definition of the latter expression is applicable. In the present respect my views are consistent with the submissions of APRA and not with those of Westport. Parliament may be taken: The question is \"how much wider\". The choice is between the holders of policies issued anywhere in the world by bodies corporate affected by the scheme on the one hand, and the holders of policies issued in their Australian branches by bodies corporate affected by the scheme on the other hand. As appears below, I think that, in effect, the latter is the correct construction because it is only the interests of such policyholders to which the Court is required to have regard. I referred to at [11]-[12] above to the Act's and APRA's concern as being with the Australian branch businesses, assets and liabilities of foreign general insurers. Parliament should also be understood to have introduced subs (1A) into s 17F with knowledge of that background. A concern with the interests of policyholders world wide would represent a radical new point of departure which Parliament should be understood to have intended only if its intention to that effect is clear. In my opinion, two provisions, in particular, show that para (a) is concerned with the interests of the holders of policies that give rise to a liability of a foreign general insurer in Australia. The first of these provisions is found in subs (4) of s 17B of the Act. Subsection (4) with subs (1) of that section, is as follows: (1) No part of the insurance business of a general insurer may be: (a) transferred to another general insurer; or (b) amalgamated with the business of another general insurer; except under a scheme confirmed by the Federal Court. ... (4) Subsection (1) does not require that a transfer or amalgamation of insurance business be made under a scheme approved by the Federal Court if: (a) immediately before the transfer or amalgamation, the insurance business is carried on outside Australia; and (b) the transfer or amalgamation will result in the insurance business being carried on outside Australia. Subsection (1) of s 17B is the first and principal substantive provision of Div 3A. The remaining provisions of Div 3A are dependent on it. And subs (1) is subject to subs (4)'s exclusion or carving out. Subsections (1) and (4) of s 17B contemplate a division of the insurance business of a general insurer into \"parts\" --- a part carried on in Australia and a part carried on outside Australia. The requirement of confirmation does not apply to the latter. The whole of Div 3A, including the recently introduced subs(1A) of s 17F, is to be read subject to that exclusion. APRA submits that s 17F is not to be read subject to s 17B and that once a transfer or amalgamation is found to fall within s 17B(1) and therefore to require confirmation by the Court, s 17F applies without any limitation or reading down. While I appreciate the force of this submission, I do not accept it. It seems to me that the effect of s 17B is not spent once a transfer or amalgamation scheme is found to require confirmation. Rather, the section's division of an insurance business into the part carried on in Australia and the part carried on overseas exposes an intention as to \"the interests of the policyholders\" which respectively the Court must and must not treat as relevant for the purposes of s 17F(1A)(a). Division 3A leaves to overseas legal systems and regulators the interests of the holders of policies issued in the carrying on of that part of an insurance business that is carried on outside Australia. It is a mistake, in my view, to read para (a) of s 17F(1A) as indicating that the interests of all policyholders of a body corporate that is a party to a scheme are necessarily to be treated as potentially affected by the scheme. The paragraph leaves open the possibility that it may be able to be said a priori and by reference to the other provisions of the Act that for the purposes of the paragraph there is a class of policyholders whose interests are not affected by the scheme. In my opinion, the Act's provisions to which I have referred above and will refer below, require that that view be taken of the interests of policyholders of non-Australian branches. The second provision to which I referred is found in s 116(3) of the Act which is as follows: (3) In the winding up of a general insurer, the insurer's assets in Australia must not be applied in the discharge of its liabilities other than its liabilities in Australia unless it has no liabilities in Australia. Section 116A of the Act elaborates on the meaning of the expressions \"asset in Australia\" and \"liability in Australia\" for the purposes of s 116 (as well as for the purposes of ss 28, 62M, 62ZZC and 62ZZE as mentioned at [11] above). This provision also gives context to para (a) of s 17F(1A). The interests of the holders of policies issued in the course of that part of the business of a foreign general insurer, such as Westport, SRI and SRC, that is carried on outside Australia are based on liabilities of the foreign general insurer arising under contracts of insurance made outside Australia. Those liabilities are therefore not liabilities \"in Australia\" and s 116(3), like s 17B(4), makes the interests of policyholders based on those liabilities an irrelevant consideration for the purposes of s 17F(1A)(a). Notwithstanding the conclusion that I have reached, I respectfully suggest that legislative amendment is desirable to put the intended meaning of para (a) of s 17F(1A) beyond doubt. Outline of the Schemes Both Schemes are subject to three conditions, namely: confirmation by the Court; approval by a delegate of the Treasurer under s. 38 of the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1991 (Cth); and approval of Westport's regulator in Missouri, namely, the Missouri Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions & Professional Registration (the Regulator). Condition (b) was satisfied prior to the hearing. My orders of 17 December were expressed to be subject to satisfaction of condition (c) by 31 December 2009. On 17 December 2009, the Regulator issued two letters stating that it had no intention of disapproving the Insurance Scheme or the Reinsurance Scheme and in fact referring to its \"approval\" of them. Of course, as the Regulator's letters made clear, the approvals did not imply approval of accounting treatments, admissibility of assets or any other conditions. Both Schemes provided that on and from the \"Effective Date\", 1 January 2010, the \"Insurance Contracts\" in the case of the Insurance Scheme, and the \"Reinsurance Contracts\" in the case of the Reinsurance Scheme, would be transferred to, in effect, SRI and SRC respectively, including any liabilities that had arisen or might arise under them (see cl 4 of each Scheme). Each of SRI and SRC indemnifies Westport in respect of the liabilities assumed. As consideration for the transfer, Westport is to pay to each of SRI and SRC an amount known as the \"Transfer Value\". This is an amount intended to be the value of the liabilities being transferred. For the Insurance Scheme the Transfer Value is $39.137 million and for the Reinsurance Scheme the Transfer Value is $232.072 million. There is to be no change to the terms of any of Westport's insurance or reinsurance policies other than the substitution of SRI or SRC as the insurer liable. The Schemes' rationale The Schemes are part of a rationalisation or consolidation of the Swiss Re group's Australian operations. The Australian policyholders of one Swiss Re group company (Westport) are transferred to other members of the group (SRI and SRC). In the result, the Swiss Re group's insurance and reinsurance businesses in Australia will be carried on through separate entities. Several benefits are intended to be achieved through the transfer. It is expected that the legal structure of the group's business in Australia will be simplified, and that there will be improved capital and operational efficiencies and a corresponding savings in costs and expenses. The Schemes will also permit the more efficient use of capital within the Swiss Re group of companies by facilitating the release of surplus capital currently held in Westport. It is intended that that capital will be repatriated and applied for the corporate purposes of the group. Westport intends, following the transfers under the Schemes, to apply to APRA to have its insurance authorisation under the Act revoked. It is planned that the capital remaining in Westport will be repatriated. Solvency The financial condition of Westport, SRCAU and SRIAU is set out in the actuarial reports. The following is a brief summary account of their effect. The Insurance Scheme (a) The current position is as follows: SRI does not currently carry on business in Australia, so no financial information exists in relation to SRIAU; ii. Westport had a solvency ratio of 232.9% as at 31 December 2008; iii. Westport had a pre-scheme solvency ratio of 252% as at 30 June 2009; In the September quarter of 2009, with APRA approval, Westport repatriated A$70 million. If this reduction in capital is taken into account in the 30 June 2009 calculation of solvency, Westport's solvency ratio would have been 158% as at that date. (b) It is calculated that following the transfer SRIAU will have a solvency ratio of 191%. (c) It follows that Westport's direct insurance policyholders are expected to enjoy a higher solvency ratio (191%) following the transfer than they did previously (158%). The Reinsurance Scheme (a) The current position is as follows: i. SRCAU had a solvency ratio of 167.3% as at 31 December 2008; ii. SRCAU had a solvency ratio of 182% as at 30 June 2009; iii. Westport had a solvency ratio of 232.9% as at 31 December 2008; Westport had a solvency ratio (once the A$70m repatriation is taken into account, as described above) of 158% as at 30 June 2009. (b) It is calculated that following the transfer SRCAU will have a solvency ratio of 160%. (c) It follows that Westport's reinsurance policyholders are expected to enjoy an approximately equivalent (but probably slightly higher) solvency coverage ratio following the transfer (160% as against 158%). On the evidence, there is no disadvantage to the affected policyholders as a result of either Scheme. Each of SRIAU and SRCAU has a capital management plan under which it intends to maintain a solvency ratio of at least 150% of the MCR set by APRA. Policy terms and conditions There will be no change in the terms and conditions of the policies of affected policyholders, apart from the substitution of SRI or SRC as insurer. Claims handling procedures and culture Claims made on Westport are already handled by SRC's claims division. There will be no change in this respect following the implementation of the Schemes. Each transfer is an intra-group transfer, not a transfer of policies to an entirely new corporate group. The De Ravin reports The approved actuary for Westport, SRIAU and SRCAU, John De Ravin, prepared two reports dated 11 November 2009 concerning the respective Schemes. They support the findings referred to at [70]-[72] above which I need not repeat. Mr De Ravin concludes in relation to both Schemes that the interests of the affected policyholders will not be materially adversely affected by the Scheme. As previously noted, in the case of the Insurance Scheme there are no existing policyholders of SRIAU whose interests are to be considered (see [22] above). In relation to the Reinsurance Scheme Mr De Ravin concludes that the interests of the continuing policyholders of SRCAU will not be materially adversely affected by the Reinsurance Scheme. The following two extracts from Mr De Ravin's report are relevant to their positions (I have substituted my \"SRCAU\" for his \"SRAU\"): Continuing SRCAU policyholders Solvency Ratio of SRCAU as at 31 December 2008 167% Pre-Scheme Solvency Ratio of SRCAU as at 30 June 2009 182% Post-Scheme Solvency Ratio of SRCAU as at 30 June 2009 160% As noted above, the above analysis ignores the impact of any potential diversification on the valuation of SRCAU's policy liabilities and the potential development of the Solvency Ratio between 30 June 2009 and 31 December 2009. In summary, the Solvency Ratio relevant to SRCAU policyholders will reduce on the Effective Date of the Scheme. However, even after the Scheme is implemented, the likely post-Scheme SRCAU Solvency Ratio is nevertheless in excess of SRCAU's target Solvency Ratio (as per its Capital Management Plan) of 150%. Continuing SRCAU policyholders will under the Scheme and Transfer: immediately post-transfer, experience a reduction in the Solvency Ratio of SRCAU but to a level which is nevertheless expected to be in excess of the SRCAU target capital of 150% of APRA's MCR; continue to benefit from APRA's \"inside Australia\" assets protection under the Insurance Act for Australian policyholders; continue to be protected by a balance sheet that is managed under a Capital Management Plan that targets 150% of the APRA minimum with the additional protection of the /standard & Poor's A+ SRC balance sheet if required; and continue to be subject to the same general management and claims management practices, philosophy and culture as they were, immediately prior to the Scheme implementation. The Atkins reports Westport instructed Geoffrey Michael Atkins, an experienced actuary, to conduct an independent peer review of the De Ravin reports. The Atkins reports review the methodology underpinning the De Ravin reports, comment on whether the conclusions reached in the De Ravin Reports are soundly based, and consider whether there were any additional issues to which attention should be drawn. Mr Atkins found (at 3.1 of each report) that: (a) The methodology used by Mr De Ravin to assess the impact of the Schemes on policyholders \"correctly addresses the interests of policyholders\"; (b) Mr De Ravin's conclusions were fully supported by the information given to him; (c) It would be prudent to confirm that there have been no major changes to the financial position of any of the companies and if any changes have occurred, that these do not have an impact on the conclusions made. (d) Mr De Ravin had made all desirable and appropriate enquiries, and no matters of significance have been withheld from the Court. Conclusion I considered that interests of policyholders were adequately protected because: (a) The terms and conditions of the transferred policies will remain unaltered, save for the substitution of SRI or SRC as the insurer liable on them; (b) The claims management procedures in respect of the transferred policies will be unaltered; (c) SRIAU and SRCAU will hold adequate capital to protect the interests of policyholders, both the existing (continuing) reinsurance policyholders of SRCAU and the insurance and reinsurance policyholders being transferred by Westport, being capital above 150% of APRA's MCR. (d) The expert opinion evidence before the Court is that the interests of none of the classes of policyholders referred to will be materially adversely affected by the implications of the Schemes. APRA appeared on the hearing and raised no objection to confirmation of the two Schemes. There was no objection to either Scheme by any policyholder, despite the Schemes and the right of appearance and objection having been widely publicised. CONCLUSION As indicated earlier, it was for the Earlier Reasons and those set out above that I made the orders on 17 December 2009. I certify that the preceding eighty-three (83) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lindgren. Associate: Dated: 20 January 2010 Counsel for the Applicant: Mr N J Owens Solicitor for the Applicant: Allens Arthur Robinson Solicitor for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority: Mr L B Weate Date of Hearing: 17 December 2009 Date of Judgment: 17 December 2009 Date of Publication of Reasons: 20 January 2010 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1598.html","title":"09_1598.txt","id":"32"},{"snippet":"1 The applicant (formerly Western Power Corporation (WPC), now relevantly 'ERC') seeks leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment of the Court given by Siopis J on 15 September 2006 ( Griffin Energy Pty Ltd v Western Power Corporation [2006] FCA 1241). The effect of his Honour's reasons, which was reflected in the orders that he made subsequently after the parties had conferred, was to grant to the respondent (collectively 'Griffin') an application pursuant to O 15A r 6(a) of the Federal Court Rules (FCR) for preliminary discovery. That requires it to be established that 'there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicant has or may have the right to obtain relief in the Court from a person whose description has been ascertained'. 2 The notice of motion for leave to appeal is supported by an affidavit of M/s Eversden, a solicitor of the ERC's solicitors sworn and filed on 22 September 2006. 3 The grant of leave from an interlocutory order is governed by the principles stated by the Full Court in Décor Corp Pty Limited v Dart Industries Inc (1991) 33 FCR 397 as recently affirmed by the Full Court in Brilliant Digital Entertainment Pty Limited v Universal Music Aust. Pty Limited (2004) 63 IPR 373 ( Brilliant Digital 63 IPR). The two central considerations are: (i) whether the decision to make the orders is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court; and (ii) whether substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision to make the orders to be wrong. 4 Where the decision in question concerns a matter of practice and procedure, rather than substantive rights, the Court will ordinarily be very reluctant to grant leave to appeal: Cadence Asset Management Pty Limited v Concept Sports Pty Limited (2006) 58 ACSR 435 at 441 per Young J ( Cadence 58 ACSR). An appeal from a discretionary decision by a trial judge itself attracts special principles, the test being whether the primary judge's discretion miscarried, by reason of some error of principle: Cadence 58 ACSR at 22 and the authorities there cited. 5 The decision of his Honour involves a matter of practice and procedure: Hooper v Kirella Pty Ltd [1999] FCA 1584 ; (1999) 96 FCR 1, at [6]. It also involves, in part, the application of a discretion. BACKGROUND CIRCUMSTANCES 6 The proceeding before his Honour related to a wish of WPC to procure a new electricity generating plant pursuant to sch 7 of the Electricity Corporation Act 1994 (WA). Whenever WPC had a need to acquire what is referred to as 'substantial new generation' capacity it must procure such capacity through a non-discriminatory and open public Power Procurement Process (PPP). The PPP which is in issue is that which took place between December 2002 and September 2005 being for the procurement of new generation capacity to meet the requirements of the South West Interconnected System (the main transmission network in the State). 7 As his Honour's reasons explained, the bid process involved the following four stages: 1. From 20 December 2002 to 2 May 2003 parties submitted their expressions of interest and WPC nominated some as qualified to proceed to the next stage. 2. The second stage was referred to as the 'Request for Proposal' (RFP) stage. On 31 March 2004 WPC issued the Request for Proposal Information Memorandum by which the qualified parties were requested to submit a non-binding proposal by 6 August 2004. On that date Griffin submitted a proposal for a coal-fired power station. 3. The final bid stage ran until 22 July 2005. A limited number of parties invited to do so (which included Griffin), compiled and submitted their final bids to WPC. By reason of a Bid Agreement entered into with WPC, Griffin was required to adhere to its final binding proposal to the choice of fuel for the power station that it had nominated in its non-binding proposal. WPC considered and announced (in August 2005) the preferred bidder, Wambo Power Ventures Pty Ltd (Wambo) 4. The fourth stage involved negotiation of project agreements with the preferred bidder. 8 Griffin and the other respondent companies brought an application before his Honour for preliminary discovery for access to a number of documents relating to the winning bid from Wambo. They sought production of the invitation, the proposal and any contract, arrangement or understanding by WPC to Wambo with respect to the bid or proposal to construct the new electricity power station. 9 Before his Honour the application by Griffin relied upon the affidavits of Mr Trumble affirmed on 22 November 2005, 8 March 2006 and 3 April 2006. In opposition to the application, WPC relied upon the affidavits of Mr Baden Furphy dated 7 April 2006 and Mr Harvey sworn on 22 February 2006 and 29 March 2006. 10 The grounds for the application for preliminary discovery brought by Griffin were that it required the documents which it sought to have sufficient information to determine whether to commence proceedings against WPC for misleading or deceptive conduct pursuant to s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( Trade Practices Act ) and/or breach of implied contract. The action was brought as a consequence of Griffin having seen documents relating to the obtaining of environmental improvement from the Minister for the Environment for Wambo's power station. This caused them to believe that there was a substantial difference in the proposed power station that was the subject of Griffin's tender and the proposed power station that was the subject of Wambo's winning tender. 11 Griffin's tender was to build, own and operate a coal-fired power station capable of generating at least 300 MW to 330 MW constantly on a sent-out basis. However Wambo's proposed power station had a baseload capacity of 240 MW and could only generate 320 MW of power by generating a further 80 MW of power through the operation of gas-fired duct booster system which, because of conditions imposed by the Minister for the Environment, could only operate 15 per cent of the time. The result was that Griffin believed that, acting in reliance upon the information supplied by WPC, they proposed a more expensive power station than that proposed by Wambo and thus disadvantaged themselves in the tender process. PRIMARY JUDGE'S REASONS 12 In his reasons his Honour identified two potential relevant representations. The first ('the generating capacity representation') was that '[WPC] would only consider tenders that provided for a generated capacity of at least 300 megawatts to 330 megawatts constantly provided on a sent-out basis'. The second (the minimum environmental condition representation) was that '[WPC] would only consider tenders that satisfied the minimum environmental conditions specified in the tender documents'. 13 As his Honour expressed it, in simple terms Griffin said that WPC called for tenders for a 300 MW to 330 MW baseload plant which was required to meet prescribed environmental standards. However, it awarded the tender to a plant with a 240 MW baseload capacity and an 80 MW peaking capacity which did not meet the prescribed environmental standards. 14 In his reasons his Honour made clear that WPC opposed the application, firstly, on the grounds that FCR O 15A r 6(a) could not be satisfied and, secondly, on the basis that as a matter of discretion, relief should be refused. 15 Turning to the first of those issues, his Honour reviewed at some length the evidence of Mr Trumble and Mr Harvey. 16 Turning to Griffin's postulated potential claim for a contravention of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act , his Honour identified the elements required to be established as: misleading or deceptive conduct by WPC, reliance by Griffin and damage. 17 In then examining the evidence and whether it satisfied FCR O 15A r 6(a) his Honour relied upon the reasoning of Hely J in St George Bank Limited v Rabo Australia Limited (2004) 211 ALR 147 ( St George Bank 211 ALR) at 153-154 to the following effect: '... (c) the test for determining whether the applicant has \"reasonable cause to believe\", as required by sub-paragraph (a), is an objective one; ... (d) belief requires more than mere assertion and more than suspicion or conjecture. Belief is an inclination of the mind towards assenting to, rather than rejecting a proposition. Thus it is not sufficient to point to a mere possibility. The evidence must incline the mind towards the matter or fact in question. If there is no reasonable cause to believe that one of the necessary elements of a potential cause of action exists, that would dispose of the application insofar as it is based on that cause of action:... (e) whilst uncertainty as to only one element of a cause of action might be compatible with the \"reasonable cause to believe\" required by sub-paragraph (a), uncertainty as to the number of such elements may be sufficient to undermine the reasonableness of the cause to believe; ...' 18 At [82] his Honour said: '82. The question, applying the test in Rabo , is whether there is evidence in support of the potential claim which elevates the potential claim beyond 'mere assertion' and 'more than suspicion or conjecture'. ' 19 At [88] his Honour said: '88 On the basis of that evidence, I am of the view that there is a foundation beyond mere assertion upon which the applicants can base a potential claim that, in referring in its press releases to the proposed power station as having a 300MW to 330MW of baseload generating capacity, the respondent, thereby, represented that it 'would only consider tenders that provided for a generated capacity of at least 300 megawatts to 330 megawatts constantly provided on that sent-out basis'. ' 20 At [91], having said that the evidence upon which WPC relied would in the context of the actual proceeding raise a serious question to be tried as to whether Mr Trumble did and could have held the understanding of baseload capacity which he did: '91 ... But this does not mean that, for the purposes of this application, the status of the applicants' postulated potential claim is thereby reduced to a 'mere assertion', 'conjecture' or 'speculation'; nor does it incline the mind against the characterisation of that potential claim as one which may give the applicants a right to relief. ' 21 In relation to the second and third elements of the alleged s 52 claim, his Honour concluded at [92]: '92 I am satisfied that the evidence as to reliance and damage in respect of the potential claim founded upon the generating capacity representation, also causes those elements to rise above the status of 'mere assertion'. It follows that, in my view, the applicants have established that there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicants may have the right to obtain relief founded upon the statements in the press releases issued by the respondent prior to 6 August 2004. ' 22 In relation to the postulated claim relating to prescribed environmental conditions, his Honour concluded at [94]-[95]: '94 Further, there is no dispute between the parties that on the evidence, the proposed Wambo power station does not meet the requirements that are stated in cl 6.3.1 and cl 6.3.2 of the Bid Information Memorandum. The answer which the respondent makes to the potential claim is that the requirements referred to in cl 6.3.1 and cl 6.3.2 did not impose absolute standards, but were only standards that a proponent should 'strive' to meet or exceed. Whether this is a complete answer or not, would be a matter for trial. It suffices to say that the evidence establishes that there is a potential claim for a contravention of s 52 of the TP Act, beyond a 'mere assertion', founded on the representation that the respondent would only accept tenders which satisfied the minimum environmental conditions specified in the tender documents. 95 There is, in addition, evidence from Mr Trumble that he relied upon those statements in submitting the tender and evidence that the applicants spent several million dollars on the bid, which I am satisfied also causes those elements of a potential claim under the TP Act to rise above the characterisation of 'mere assertion'. I, accordingly, find that there is reasonable cause to believe that the applicants may have a right to obtain relief against the respondent founded upon the statement in the Bid Information Memorandum and the Final Bid Invitation which relate to the compliance with environmental conditions. ' 23 In relation to the contract claim, his Honour said there was no need to deal with it and it is suffice to say that the exclusion clauses in the Bid Agreement appeared, on the face of it, to comprise a substantial obstacle for Griffin. 24 His Honour therefore concluded that Griffin had satisfied the provisions of FCR O 15A r 6(a). There was no issue on satisfaction of other provisions of that Rule. 25 In relation to the discretionary considerations, these were founded on the affidavit of Mr Furphy and related to the confidential character of the bid proposals, submissions, presentations and other documents which record or evidence the content of any proposals submitted by Wambo to WPC. 26 In relation to those issues, his Honour concluded at [110]-[111]: '110 ... The fact that the documents in respect of which discovery is sought may contain confidential information will not usually in itself be sufficient to cause the Court, in the exercise of its discretion to decline to order preliminary discovery. In this case, the applicants recognise restrictions may need to be imposed upon the number of persons who may be entitled to inspect the discovered documents. 111 Further, limiting inspection also strikes a balance between the legitimate concerns expressed by senior counsel for the respondent as to the need to maintain confidence in the respondent's public tender process, and the applicants' concerns as to whether the process operated lawfully. ' Accordingly, his Honour concluded that Griffin's notice of motion was entitled to succeed. GROUNDS IN SUPPORT OF APPLICATION FOR LEAVE Power generated capacity representation 27 In his reasons his Honour said that the act of reliance on this alleged representation must have occurred on or before 6 August 2004. That was common ground for the purposes of the application so that his Honour was required to rely only on documents predating that date for evidence of reliance. 28 His Honour referred to the evidence of Mr Trumble in which he identified the documents which had led him to believe that WPC required the proposed power station to have a baseload generating capacity of between 300 MW and 330 MW of power. The first category of documents was Process Updates Nos 2, 5, 12, 13 and 19. These so described the capacity sought. The other categories were documents which arose after 6 August 2004 and so after the date relevant to reliance of the non-binding proposal to which Griffin subsequently became bound by WPC. However, Mr Trumble's evidence at [24] of his first affidavit was that in submitting the proposals of Griffin he relied on all the categories referred to in the relevant paragraphs of his affidavit. At [44] he deposed: 'If Griffin Energy, Griffin Electricity or Griffin Power had been aware that Western Power was prepared to accept a proposal that did not conform with the requirements set out in its Bid Information Memorandum and Final Bid Invitation, then either none of them would have submitted a bid, or they would have submitted a bid that combined a coal-fired baseload plant of lower capacity with a [sic] open-cycle gas peaking plant. Such a plant would have been more economically efficient than a coal-fired baseload plant of similar total capacity. ' 29 ERC now submits that it is significant Mr Trumble's evidence did not make any reference to the RFP of 31 March 2004 or the Request for Proposal of 27 April 2004, each of which were exhibited to Mr Harvey's affidavit. Each contained a disclaimer, prominently appearing at their commencement. They were each expressed to be applicable to 'all information from time to time provided or made available by or on behalf of [WPC] to a Proponent in relation to the process being adopted by [WPC] for the procurement of at least 300 MW to 330 MW approximately of new generating capacity ...'. Whether error of law in application of wrong test 30 ERC now submits that when his Honour reached the views set out in [82], [88], [91] and [92] he fell into error of law by applying the wrong test and applying too low a threshold for establishing the claim was more than a 'mere assertion'. Therefore, it is said, that his Honour failed to apply the test stipulated by FCR O 15A r 6(a) as explained in St George Bank 211 ALR. 31 The argument made by ERC is that his Honour adopted the test of 'foundation beyond mere assertion' and, in so doing, failed to spell out what inclined the mind towards belief and thus failed to consider all the evidence. It is submitted he adopted a minimum threshold which prevented him from properly applying the test. 32 I however agree with the submissions for Griffin that his Honour did not misunderstand nor did he misapply the proper test for the application of FCR O 15A r 6(a) as explained in St George Bank 211 ALR. Firstly, it is clear from [12] of his Honour's reasons that he clearly understood the appropriate test. In [64] and [91] he expressly used language relevant to the concept of the mind being inclined to belief. It is clear from [82] that he was looking for evidence in support of the potential claim which elevated it beyond 'mere assertion' and 'more than suspicion or conjecture'. When he came to [88] and [92] his reference to elements rising above the status of 'mere assertion' was a shorthand reference to the test which he had earlier more fully set out. His Honour used that shorthand reference in the context of his examination of the evidence quite fulsomely. It cannot properly be said that the shorthand reference caused him to fail to attend to the evidence. What ERC is asserting is that he should have dealt with the evidence in a different way. It is to be borne in mind that Griffin was not required to establish a prima facie case and that the standard of 'reason to believe' constitutes a 'relatively low threshold': The Daniels Corporation International Pty Limited v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission [2002] HCA 49 ; (2002) 213 CLR 543 at [130] per Callinan J. Whether reliance improbable 33 ERC submits that the proposition there could have been reliance by Mr Trumble upon the press releases preceding 6 August 2004 was inherently improbable. This submission is made in the context of the information memorandum and requests for approval which it is said made that inherent probability apparent. However, even if regard is had to those other documents and the place they had at the bidding process, it does not remove the possibility that the Process Updates press releases, notwithstanding there relative brevity, might have been significant in communicating WPC's intentions in relation to power procurement to a wide audience which would have included potential bidders. They were issued over a period of nearly two years and were the only documents upon which reliance could be placed at that time. If there was no clearly articulated change, it might be able to be found that it was reasonable for the audience of potential bidders to assume that later formal documents would relate to the same proposal, albeit providing greater detail. That is, the Process Updates as a source of misrepresentation cannot be ruled out by what might be thought to be their relative primitive character in the chain of documentation processes. In Lezam Pty Ltd v Seabridge Australia Pty Ltd (1992) 35 FCR 535 at 556 ( Lezam 35 FCR), Burchett J said: 'A misrepresenter does not obliterate the effect of a misrepresentation clearly made, which induces an ascent to proposed terms, by adding, as the time of final agreement approaches, a qualification capable of conveying merely that the misrepresentation, the substance of which is not withdrawn, may not be accurate in every detail and may require some, possibly quite minor, qualification. ' His Honour was there stating a principle and it is not to the point to seek to distinguish the circumstances in Lezam 35 FCR from the circumstances before his Honour. Whether in fact the Process Updates could have (a) created a misrepresentation; and (b) were not corrected are issues of fact for trial. Disclaimers 34 I agree with the submission for Griffin that even if some qualification or reservation was expressed in the later documents in the disclaimers, there is an issue whether it would have been expressed in such a way as to remove the 'real or not remote chance or possibility' ( Global Sportsman Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1984) 2 FCR 82 at 87 the Full Court citing with approval Tillmanns Butcheries Pty Ltd v Australasian Meat Industry Employees' Union (1979) 42 FLR 331 at 346 per Deane J) that the earlier documents had created a misleading impression as to what it was that WPC was inviting persons to tender to supply and did nothing to correct such impression. The issue before his Honour was whether there was reason to believe Griffin may have a claim in respect of the conduct of WPC, taken as a whole (see Parkdale Custom Built Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191 at 199) as misleading or likely to be so. As Burchett J said in Lezam 35 FCR at 557 'a disclaimer or qualification will frequently have little or no effect on the impact of a misrepresentation'. 35 In any event, the disclaimers, as have been set out in [55]-[57] of his Honour's reasons, in each of the opening paragraphs of the disclaimers reference is made to the 'procurement of at least 300 MW to 330 MW approximately of new generating capacity', a representation which could only go to reinforce the statements contained in the Process Updates in relation to generating capacity. Further, there was no reference to the power station being anything other than a baseload power station. In short, the disclaimers can be understood as having done nothing to dispel the effect of the Process Updates repeated a number of times over the space of nearly two years. Alleged reversal of onus of proof 36 The conclusion of his Honour in [90] read as follows: 'However, it is not obvious that this evidence must inevitably lead to the conclusion that Mr Trumble did, and could not as a reasonable member of the power generation industry have, understood the term 'baseload capacity' in the way that he has deposed. ' 37 ERC suggests in respect of [90] of his Honours reasons that they effectively reverse the onus of proof by considering whether WPC had adduced evidence to disprove the evidence relied upon by Griffin. I agree with the submission for Griffin that proper examination of the reasons at [89] and [90] does not support this characterisation. The approach was consistent with the development over time (from June 2002 to August 2004) of Mr Trumble's understanding of what WPC was seeking by the tenders process (he being the relevant directing mind within Griffin). Consistent with the consideration of the documents relied on by Mr Trumble, it was legitimate to ask the question whether anything said by WPC later in the process corrected any supposedly false impression that may have been created earlier, particularly by the 'Process Updates'. His Honour concluded that the later communications did not incline the mind against the characterisation he had earlier given to Griffins' potential claim as one falling within FCR O 15A r 6(1). Factual errors with Mr Harvey's evidence 38 In [90] his Honour continued: 'Firstly, Mr Trumble was not cross-examined on his evidence. Secondly, the evidence does not address the apparent conflict between the respondent's stated requirement in the bid information, of the plant's high availability, which Mr Trumble said was in the order of 90 per cent, and the 'capacity factor' referred to of 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Thirdly, after 6 August 2004, the respondent issued, as part of the bid information a terms sheet for the ACA which provided that as a performance requirement, the proponent must ensure that the TCO is available from the Power Station at all times during the term --- a statement, which could arguably be construed as articulating a performance requirement which is consistent with Mr Trumble's understanding of the term 'baseload capacity'. ' The reference to non-cross-examination of Mr Trumble is dealt with below. As to the factors mentioned in the second limb of his Honour's reasons, ERC submits that the availability factor drawn from the bid information post-dated 6 August 2004. The reference to 'high levels of availability' is nevertheless contained in documents pre-dating 6 August 2004, but it is said that there is no conflict with that and the statement in the same document referrable to 'expected capacity factor of 75 per cent to 80 per cent'. As to the evidence relied upon in the third factor of the above quoted paragraph, it is submitted by ERC that it fails to take into account certain evidence from Mr Harvey that the reference to 'available at all time' did not mean that the power station must be able to operate at 300-330 MW 100 per cent of the time or a concession by Mr Trumble that no power station operates without interruption. 39 Neither the availability factor (90 per cent) nor the capacity factor (75-80 per cent) were at the heart of the issue which was the required capacity of the plant. It was never Griffins' case that the power station would in fact be required to operate at full capacity 100 per cent of the time but rather that it should have the capacity to do so. Mr Trumble's evidence recognised this and that is referred to in his Honour's reasons at [84]. It was supported by the Ministerial Statement discussed at [86] and [87]. The availability factor recognised that all power stations require maintenance while the capacity factor recognised the fact of variable demand during 24 hours of operation. What was not disputed was that the Wambo plant, which won the tender, was capable of operating at 320 MW only up to 15 per cent of the time, and concession of this was made by WPC during argument before his Honour. It is clear that his Honour turned his mind to these arguments in his reasons at [90]. 40 I do not consider that any of these alleged factual errors are of such magnitude and significance that if considered, as ERC submits, they would have necessarily caused his Honour to reach a contrary view. Non-cross-examination of Mr Trumble 41 There is said to be an error of law in his Honour's reasons having regard to the fact that Mr Trumble was not cross-examined as to his understanding of baseload and peaking power plants. That is, it is said that he placed undue weight on the fact that Mr Trumble was not cross-examined as part of determining whether Griffin had established a reasonable cause to believe that they have or may have a right to relief. 42 His Honour was entitled to place weight and did not place undue weight on the fact that Mr Trumble was not cross-examined. Mr Trumble's understanding of the difference between a baseload and a peaking plant was central to his understanding of what it was WPC was seeking by the tender process. Mr Harvey gave considerable affidavit evidence in an endeavour to suggest that Mr Trumble was mistaken in his understanding. This was then addressed by Mr Trumble in his second affidavit of 7 March 2006. His Honour's conclusion at [85] also relied on evidence from other sources which he considered supported Mr Trumble's evidence that his understanding of baseload capacity and peaking capacity accorded with the common understanding of those terms in the power generation industry. In my view no error of law is apparent. Wording of Process Updates incapable of giving rise to reliance 43 In his reasons at [22]-[27], his Honour set out the relevant passages of the Process Updates. ERC submits that none of these Updates purported to set tender conditions or that tenders would only be considered on a particular basis. Further, that only the last of the Updates referred to the 'sent-out' basis and the others referred to baseload capacity. Also, that none of them referred to 'constantly provided' which formed part of the representation under consideration by his Honour in respect of the generated power capacity. Therefore, it is submitted that there is no room for reliance to be made out in respect of the Process Updates press releases. 44 I do not consider that in reaching the conclusion which his Honour did, that there was reason to believe there might be a claim with respect to misrepresentation concerning the generated power capacity arising from the Process Updates, that his Honour was in error in not having regard to the content of those Updates. It was not necessary for them to address tender conditions and that was not the relevance of them here. Each of them (and in combination) is evidence of a representation that what would be sought was a 300 MW (in some cases to 330 MW) baseload generation capacity. The absence of reference to sent-out basis or to 'constantly provided' is an issue to be addressed by other evidence, if at all. There was no error by his Honour in considering that there was reason to believe that the wording in the Process Updates could be the source of a claim if it was otherwise made out. Furthermore, the essential question and issue before his Honour in this regard was whether there had been a resiling by WPC from the requirement that the power station have a baseload generating capacity of 300 to 330 MW of power. Environmental requirements representation 45 This alleged representation was '[WPC] would only consider tenders ... which satisfied the minimum environmental conditions specified in the tender documents'. 46 This representation is said to have been contained in the Bid Information Memorandum. Relevantly it stated: '5.7 Evaluation and selection process The Binding Proposal will also be required to meet minimum standards for: ...Best commercially available environmental performance of the Power Station (as defined below in paragraphs 6.2 [sic] . 6.1 Requirements ...the Power Station must meet best commercially available environmental performance for fuel and unit size, as described in paragraph 6.3... 6.3 Plant Environmental Performance The best commercially available environmental performance for the fuel and unit size is taken to be as described in the following paragraphs. Bidders must strive to meet or exceed these levels of performance. ' [emphasis added] His Honour's reasoning on this representation is set out above at [22]. Whether error of law in failing to interpret properly construed words 47 Here ERC contends that his Honour failed to interpret the words in cl 6.3 of the Bid Information Memorandum in accordance with the proper rules of construction, namely, to give the words there plain English meaning. It is submitted that if the words were given that meaning, his Honour would have been bound to conclude that all the bidders had to do was 'strive to meet or exceed' the levels of environmental performance described therein and there was no evidence before the Court that Wambo did not meet that requirement, so understood. 48 I do not agree with the submission by ERC that the words of this alleged misrepresentation are expressive only of a 'plain meaning'. I accept the submission for Griffin that the alternative interpretation is equally arguable. That interpretation is that the 'minimum standards' which the binding proposal was 'required to meet' and which the power station 'must meet' referred to the bidding stage, while the reference to bidders 'must strive to meet or exceed those levels of performance' addressed the requirements of WPC once the power station was in operation. There was no error by his Honour in reaching that conclusion. Error of law from application of wrong test 49 Again ERC contends that his Honour's conclusion at [94] involved an application of the considerations of beyond a mere assertion and failed to apply the St George Bank 211 ALR test properly. For the reasons previously given that submission does not succeed. Reliance 50 ERC submits that Mr Trumble gave no evidence of reliance in his first affidavit. It is said that his affidavit of 7 March 2006 'was no more than mere assertion'. Further, that he gave no evidence as to how Griffin would have modified its tender. Mr Trumble's evidence was that if Griffin had known that standards were ones which WPC would consider to be satisfied if a bidding party had merely expressed a willingness to endeavour to meet them, Griffin would have modified its proposal and would have been able to submit a final bid at a lower price than that which it did. That evidence was not the subject of cross-examination by WPC. I do not therefore accept that the submissions of ERC disclose an absence of reliance possibly being made out. Substantial injustice 51 ERC submits that substantial injustice would result if leave were refused. This is said to be because of the issues dealt with by his Honour under the heading 'Discretionary considerations' and relating to the confidential character of the evidence which is required to be disclosed by WPC in response to the order for preliminary discovery. This is asserted even though his Honour's order is crafted so as to provide restrictions of access in relation to inspection: see [110] and [111] of his Honour's reasons quoted above at [26]. In addition, reliance is placed on the affidavit of M/s Eversden where it is said that if leave is not granted the categories of documents which WPC will be required to make available would contain highly confidential information and that it should not be required to give Griffin access to commercially sensitive information. 52 I agree with the submission for Griffin that there is no evidence which would suggest that the principle in Home Office v Harman [1981] 1 QB 534 should not apply and be observed. Additionally, that any other prejudice from having to make the documents available is a natural consequence of the orders proposed by the trial judge and does not amount to the type of substantial injustice required in this context: Brilliant Digital 63 IPR at [5]-[7]. I further accept that the proposed orders do not affect matters of substantive rights of ERC, which will have every opportunity to advance appropriate arguments should Griffin initiate substantive proceedings. CONCLUSION 53 For the above reasons, I am of the view that ERC has not established that the decision to make the order for preliminary discovery is attended with sufficient doubt to warrant it being reconsidered by the Full Court. Further, I do not consider that substantial injustice would result if leave were refused, supposing the decision to make the orders to be wrong. This is an issue of practice and procedure and substantive rights remain to be tested in subsequent proceedings. The issues of confidentiality which trouble ERC can be addressed by appropriate directions. The application for leave to appeal will therefore be refused. 54 It will be necessary for his Honour to reprogram the orders which have been the subject of a stay while this application has been heard and determined. I certify that the preceding fifty-four (54) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.

BACKGROUND FACTS Chalice is a company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX). On 10 September 2009, 16,300,000 fully paid ordinary shares in Chalice were issued. That issue arose as a result of Chalice entering into an agreement with Southern Cross Equities Limited (Southern Cross), the holder of Australian Financial Services Licence 247027 under which Southern Cross was required to raise $4.4 million of new equity by way of placement of 16,300,000 fully paid ordinary shares to institutional and sophisticated investors at a price of 27 cents per share. The funds from that placement were to be used to fund general working capital requirements, principally in relation to a project in Eritrea, north eastern Africa. On the following day, Southern Cross advised it had agreements in place with institutional and sophisticated investors to subscribe for 16,300,000 fully paid ordinary shares in Chalice. There were 22 investors who participated in that placement to varying degrees but some of them, quite extensively (the Placees). At the same time, Chalice made an announcement to the ASX concerning the placement. Chalice advised that it had raised $4,401,000 before issue costs to fund the ongoing development of the Zara Project in Eritrea through the placement of the 16,300,000 shares at 27 cents per share to be made pursuant to the 15 per cent allowance under the ASX listing rules and to be completed on or around 10 September 2009. On 10 September 2009, all of the placement shares were issued and allotted to the Placees. Shortly before the placement, Chalice had completed a merger via a scheme of arrangement with Sub-Sahara Resources NL (Sub-Sahara) also listed on the ASX. On 12 August 2009, the scheme of arrangement was Court approved under s 411 of the Act. That scheme of arrangement became effective on 26 August 2009. The principal asset of Sub-Sahara is a 68.8 per cent participating interest in the gold exploration project in Eritrea called the Zara Project. Mr Richard Keith Hacker is the Company Secretary of Chalice. Part of the duties of Mr Hacker as Company Secretary of Chalice was to oversee the successful integration of Sub-Sahara and its business with Chalice following completion of the scheme of arrangement. This was a particularly busy time and his workload increased substantially once the merger became effective at the end of August 2009. He had primary responsibility for implementing the merger with Sub-Sahara in relation to accounting systems, staff and overseeing many of the other administrative issues associated with the absorption of the business of Sub-Sahara into Chalice and the relocation of its corporate records to the offices of Chalice. At the same time, in September 2009, he was heavily involved in the completion of Chalice's annual report to its shareholders which was lodged with the ASX on 24 September 2009 and was also fulfilling duties as Company Secretary to other ASX listed companies. Although Mr Hacker is assisted on accounting matters by one other person, he remains solely responsible for all secretarial and associated administrative functions within Chalice. Therefore, it was his responsibility to attend to the documentary requirements in connection with the placement which included the lodgement of an Appendix 3B in relation to the placement with the ASX. This was lodged with the ASX on 7 September 2009. He was also responsible for liaising with Chalice's Share Registrars concerning the issue and allotment of the placement shares to the 22 Placees. On the morning of 20 October 2009, Mr Hacker realised, when it was brought to his attention by Southern Cross, that a notice complying with s 708A(6) of the Act had not been given in relation to the placement as required in accordance with s 708A(5)(e) of the Act (the Notice). He has issued such notices in the past and is familiar with their function and purpose. On this occasion, due to his increased workload and involvement in overseeing the implementation of the recently completed merger between Chalice and Sub-Sahara, he inadvertently omitted to give the Notice in respect of any of the placement shares. Immediately after the oversight was brought to his attention, he contacted Chalice's solicitors and sought advice as to the steps available to Chalice to rectify the position. Mr Hacker was advised by Chalice's solicitors that the Australian Securities Investments Commission (ASIC) would not provide a 'modification of law' to allow Chalice to issue the Notice out of time and that the only avenue available to Chalice was to seek an order from this Court under s 1322(4) of the Act to enable the Notice to be given out of time. Accordingly, on the next day, 21 October 2009, Chalice made an announcement to the ASX indicating the situation and foreshadowing the making of this application and instructed the solicitors to write to ASIC notifying ASIC of the circumstances. The solicitors complied with that instruction on the same day. On the next day, Chalice wrote to each of the Placees notifying them of the position and the fact that a Notice in relation to the shares had not been given and of the proposed application. On the same day, Mr Hacker examined a copy of the Share Register of Chalice from which he was able to determine that six of the Placees had sold all of the shares that were issued to them totalling 1,954,584 shares and another four Placees had also sold shares after the placement but in each case the number sold was less than the number held by the relevant Placee prior to the placement and accordingly it is unclear whether the shares sold were part of the placement or shares held prior to the placement. Shortly put, the arguments for Chalice mirror the legislation. They are that the failure to give the Notice was due to inadvertence, not through any act of dishonesty or wilful intention; the placement shares were in a class of securities of Chalice that were quoted securities at all times in the three months before the day on which the placement shares were issued (that being, 10 September 2009); trading in that class of securities in the ASX was not suspended for more than a total of five days during the period of 12 months before the day on which placement shares were issued; no exemption under s 111AS or s 111AT of the Act covered Chalice or any person as director or auditor of Chalice at any time during the period of 12 months before the day on which the placement shares were issued; no order under s 340 or s 341 of the Act covered Chalice or any person as director or auditor of Chalice at any time during the period of 12 months before the day on which the placement shares were issued; at all material times, Chalice has complied with the financial reports and audit provisions under Ch 2M of the Act and the continuous disclosure provisions under s 674 of the Act; and finally, that there was no excluded information as that term is defined in s 708A(7) of the Act which would have required disclosure had the notices under s 708A(5)(e) of the Act been given within five business days of the day on which the placement shares were issued. There is no such excluded information which would now be required to be disclosed if such a notice was now given. THE LEGISLATION Section 1322(4)(a) and s 1322(4)(d) of the Act respectively provide: 1322 Irregularities (4) Subject to the following provisions of this section but without limiting the generality of any other provision of this Act, the Court may, on application by any interested person, make all or any of the following orders, either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Court imposes: (a) an order declaring that any act, matter or thing purporting to have been done, or any proceeding purporting to have been instituted or taken, under this Act or in relation to a corporation is not invalid by reason of any contravention of a provision of this Act or a provision of the constitution of a corporation; ... (d) an order extending the period for doing any act, matter or thing or instituting or taking any proceeding under this Act or in relation to a corporation (including an order extending a period where the period concerned ended before the application for the order was made) or abridging the period for doing such an act, matter or thing or instituting or taking such a proceeding; and may make such consequential or ancillary orders as the Court thinks fit. NOTICE PROVISIONS --- THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK Chapter 6 of the Act deals with takeovers. The purpose of the Chapter is to ensure that the acquisition of control of shares in the circumstances of takeovers, takes place in an efficient, competitive and informed market. The provisions aim to achieve reasonable and equal opportunities on the part of shareholders within a relevant class to participate in any benefits accruing to holders through any proposals for which a person would acquire a substantial interest in a company, body or scheme. Appropriate procedures are to be followed. To the extent relevant to this application, the Act restricts the on-sale of shares issued without disclosure under Ch 6D unless the sale is exempt under s 708 or s 708A of the Act. The current sale was exempt but it was still necessary to give a Notice to investors (the Placees in this instance) of the matters prescribed in s 708A(6) within the time set out in subs (6). The text of s 708A of the Act relevantly provides as follows: 708A Sale offers that do not need disclosure Sale offers to which this section applies (1) This section applies to an offer (the sale offer ) of a body's securities (the relevant securities ) for sale by a person if: (a) but for subsection (5), (11) or (12), disclosure to investors under this Part would be required by subsection 707(3) for the sale offer; and (b) the securities were not issued by the body with the purpose referred to in subparagraph 707(3)(b)(i); and (c) a determination under subsection (2) was not in force in relation to the body at the time when the relevant securities were issued. ... Sale offer of quoted securities---case 1 (5) The sale offer does not need disclosure to investors under this Part if: (a) the relevant securities are in a class of securities that were quoted securities at all times in the 3 months before the day on which the relevant securities were issued; and (b) trading in that class of securities on a prescribed financial market on which they were quoted was not suspended for more than a total of 5 days during the shorter of the period during which the class of securities were quoted, and the period of 12 months before the day on which the relevant securities were issued; and (c) no exemption under section 111AS or 111AT covered the body, or any person as director or auditor of the body, at any time during the relevant period referred to in paragraph (b); and (d) no order under section 340 or 341 covered the body, or any person as director or auditor of the body, at any time during the relevant period referred to in paragraph (b); and (e) either: (i) if this section applies because of subsection (1)---the body gives the relevant market operator for the body a notice that complies with subsection (6) before the sale offer is made; or (ii) if this section applies because of subsection (1A)---both the body, and the controller, give the relevant market operator for the body a notice that complies with subsection (6) before the sale offer is made. (6) A notice complies with this subsection if the notice: (a) is given within 5 business days after the day on which the relevant securities were issued by the body; and (b) states that the body issued the relevant securities without disclosure to investors under this Part; and (c) states that the notice is being given under paragraph (5)(e); and (d) states that, as at the date of the notice, the body has complied with: (i) the provisions of Chapter 2M as they apply to the body; and (ii) section 674; and (e) sets out any information that is excluded information as at the date of the notice (see subsections (7) and (8)). ... INTEREST OF OTHERS Chalice has given notification by way of an announcement to the ASX of the application for this order and has also notified the ASIC and the Placees in relation to the intention to apply for relief to issue a late but valid Notice under s 708(5)(e) of the Act. Subsequent to those events occurring, it has been confirmed on behalf of Chalice that none of the parties notified in respect of the relief which Chalice now seeks, has expressed a desire to appear or oppose the granting of the relief. Mr Hacker, the Company Secretary and Chief Financial Officer of Chalice refers to the fact that as at the time of swearing his affidavit in support of the originating process, the Placees have on-sold 1.9 million of the shares that were issued. FAILURE TO ISSUE NOTICE WAS DUE TO INADVERTENCE The failure on the part of Chalice to issue the Notice was due to inadvertence and not through any act of dishonesty or wilful intention not to issue the Notice. I accept the explanation as to the other extraordinary activities at the time which gave rise to the oversight. Inadvertence has its normal meaning as suggested in the authorities, for example, Blaze Asset Pty Ltd v Target Energy Limited [2009] FCA 698 per Barker J (at [35]). On the basis of the evidence and applying some common sense, it is plain that the oversight in failing to give the requisite Notice was caused by inadvertence. In addition, at all material times Chalice has complied with the provisions of Ch 2M (financial reporting requirements) and s 674 of the Act (continuous disclosure requirements) as they applied to Chalice; there was and is no excluded information as defined in s 708A(7) of the Act which would have been required to be disclosed or now requires disclosure and, accordingly, no injustice will have been caused to any person by reason of the Notice not having been lodged within five business days of the shares being issued. DISCRETIONARY FACTORS A relevant factor to take into account in exercising discretion to give relief as is sought in this proceeding is the promptness with which the applying corporation seeks to regularise the position. There is no doubt in the present case that Chalice has taken steps very promptly once the failure to lodge the Notice was identified. There has been no undue delay. Also central to the relief sought by this application is the fact that Chalice would have been exempt in respect of the requirements under s 708A(5) of the Act in respect of the on-sale of the shares had it given a Notice for the purpose of s 708A(5)(e) of the Act within five business days of the issue of the shares. Chalice was then and has at all material times been able to issue a Notice under that paragraph as: (a) the shares concerned are in a class of securities that were quoted securities at all times in the three months before the day on which the shares were issued; and (b) trading in that class of securities on a prescribed financial market on which they were quoted was not suspended for more than a total of five days during the shorter of the period during which the class of securities were quoted and the period of 12 months before the day on which the shares were issued; and (c) no exemption under s 111AS or s 111AT of the Act related to Chalice or any person as director or the auditor of Chalice at any time during the relevant period referred to in (b) above; and (d) no order under s 340 or s 341 of the Act related to Chalice or any person as director or auditor of Chalice at any time during the relevant period referred to in (b) above. The declaratory relief sought by Chalice under s 1322(4)(a) of the Act to the effect that a Notice given under s 708A(5)(e) of the Act within the extended period be deemed to take effect as if it had been given within the period of five business days from 10 September 2009, that is, within the required five business day period, is consistent with relief granted in the matters of Charter Hall Limited, in the matter of Charter Hall Limited [2007] FCA 1316 , Diversified, in the matter of Diversified United Investment Limited ACN 006 713 177 [2008] FCA 720 and In the Matter of Chameleon Mining NL [2009] NSWSC 660. It also gives clarity for those affected shareholders (the Placees) who on-sold the relevant securities prior to the lodgement of a Notice which complies with the section and thereby to any purchaser from them. Section 1322(6)(a) of the Act provides that the Court must not make an order under s 1322(4)(a) unless it is satisfied: (i) that the act, matter or thing, or the proceeding, referred to in that paragraph is essentially of a procedural nature; (ii) that the person or persons concerned in or party to the contravention or failure acted honestly; or (iii) that it is just and equitable that the order be made. Even though these elements are expressed disjunctively, for the reasons discussed above, I am satisfied as to each of the elements of s 1322(6)(a) of the Act. Further, s 1322(6)(c) of the Act provides that the Court must not make an order under s 1322(4)(a) unless it is satisfied that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person. I am satisfied that no substantial injustice has been or is likely to be caused to any person. It is not evident that any injustice at all will be occasioned by granting the relief sought. Indeed, the contrary may be the case if relief is refused. It seems there was no excluded information which should have been but was not disclosed that could have altered the information base of those concerned if the time limits had been met. If that is wrong, a purchaser who is able to prove that there was excluded information which should have been disclosed would presumably have an independent cause of action available and certainly by the granting of liberty to apply, will have additional relief in respect of the orders to be made in this proceeding. There is no reason to think that compliance in the circumstances would have improved the position of a purchaser ( Charter Hall Ltd at [5]). Given the requirements for notice and advertising of the proposed orders, the granting of liberty to apply to vary or discharge the orders within a limited time would appear to accommodate any presently unforeseen potential for injustice ( Chameleon Mining NL (at [12])). Generally speaking, apart from the merger described in [4] the circumstances and reasoning in this application are very similar to those in which I granted similar relief earlier this month in RCR Tomlinson Ltd (ACN 008 898 486); In the matter of RCR Tomlinson Ltd (ACN 008 898 486) [2009] FCA 1130 (6 October 2009) The following orders will be made: In respect of the 16, 300, 000 fully paid ordinary shares in the plaintiff issued on 10 September 2009 (the Relevant Securities ) the period of five business days referred to in section 708A(6) of the Corporations Act 2001 ( Act ) be extended to the second business day after the day on which these orders are entered. The notice under section 708A(5)(e) of the Act given to ASX Limited ( ASX ) in respect of the Relevant Securities within the period provided for in Order 1 be deemed to take effect as if it had been given to ASX within five business days of 10 September 2009. These orders be entered forthwith. A sealed copy of these orders be served on ASIC, ASX, and each person named in the schedule which is annexure RKH-2 to the affidavit of Richard Keith Hacker sworn on 23 October 2009 within two business days of the date of these orders. A copy of these orders also be placed on the website of the plaintiff as soon as practicable and remain there for at least 28 days. Any interested party have liberty to apply within 28 days of the entry of these orders to revoke or vary the orders.

Associate: Dated: 2 November 2009 Counsel for the Plaintiff: S Salter Solicitor for the Plaintiff: Middletons Date of Hearing: 28 October 2009 Date of Judgment: 2 November 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1236.html","title":"09_1236.txt","id":"34"},{"snippet":"This is an application in which the applicant seeks final relief against the first respondent in terms of a permanent injunction restraining the respondent from importing, promoting, distributing, advertising, offering for sale, displaying or otherwise using counterfeit hairstyling products bearing the mark \"GHD Hair Styling Iron,\" \"GHD Styler,\" or \"GHD\" or any other mark which would infringe trade mark number 951664 being a mark bearing the letters GHD registered for the class of articles the subject of these proceedings. Apart from that order, the applicant seeks delivery up of infringing articles, damages or, alternatively, an account of profits and other related relief. The applicant also seeks interlocutory orders which are the subject of the application this morning. The application has not been served upon the first respondent and, by definition, the applicant is ex parte in terms of the injunction. The applicant seeks an order directed to the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Customs Service for the purposes of s 137(5) of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth). That section provides that: If after 20 working days from the date on which the action was brought, there is not in force at any time an order of the court directed to the Customs CEO preventing the goods from being released, the Customs CEO must release the goods to their designated owner. The proceeding in question was commenced on 24 November 2009 in respect of 10 hairstyling devices which are the subject of a Notice of Seizure to Objector under the Trade Marks Act dated 19 October 2009 which was served upon or issued to the applicant on 23 October 2009. An immediate question arises in relation to the steps taken consequent upon that notice. The immediately material matter is that the Trade Marks Act provides that the applicant may bring an action for infringement of a notified trade mark in respect of the goods the subject of the notice and give notice to the CEO of that action in writing within a period of 10 working days from 23 October 2009, or, if the Chief Executive Officer extends the period under s 137(1) of the Trade Marks Act , within the extended period. The period of 10 working days from 23 October 2009 expired on 9 November 2009 and on that day the applicant sought an extension of the period. An extension was granted on Monday, 9 November 2009, at 1.36 pm by the Australian Customs Service by email extending the time to 23 November 2009. By operation of s 136 of the Trade Marks Act , the Customs CEO must release the seized goods to their \"designated owner\" (in this case, the first respondent for the purposes of Part 13 of the Trade Marks Act ) if within the action period (being the period expiring on 23 November 2009) the applicant has not brought an action for infringement of the notified trade mark in respect of the goods, and given notice to the Customs CEO in writing of that action. Section 137(1) of the Act provides that: An objector may bring an action for infringement of a notified trade mark in respect of seized goods and give notice of it to the Customs CEO: (a) --- within the period ( notified period ) of 10 working days; or (b) - if the Customs CEO, being satisfied that in the circumstances of the case it is fair and reasonable to do so, has extended the notified period for a number of working days not exceeding 10; - within that period as so extended by the Customs CEO. The question that arises is whether an order ought to be made under s 137(5) directing the Customs CEO not to release the goods to the designated owner. Section 137(5) is in these terms: If, after 20 working days from the day on which the action was brought, there is not in force at any time an order of the court directed at the Customs CEO preventing the goods from being released, the Customs CEO must release the goods to their designated owner. The application made today is made on the 20 th working day from the date of commencement of the proceeding. It is clear that the proceeding was not commenced within the extension period and, by definition, notice was not given to the Customs Service of the proceeding within the extension period. A question arises as to whether an order ought to be made under s 137(5) in circumstances where there has been a failure to commence the proceeding within the extension period and give notice of it within the extension period. As I mentioned, s 136 creates a statutory direction to the CEO to release the goods if the proceeding is not commenced and notice given within the period. Section 136 is headed \"Release of Goods to Owner --- No Action for Infringement and s 137 is headed \"Action for Infringement of Trade Mark\". Some discussion has arisen in earlier authorities, including Jemella v Mackinnon & Another [2008] FCA 1022 ; 77 IPR 243 , in which Logan J had to consider whether non-compliance with these provisions as to commencement and notification within the extension period, might have the effect of depriving the applicant of its standing to maintain infringement proceedings. I am satisfied that ss 136 and 137 , taken together, do not deprive the applicant of its standing to maintain proceedings for infringement of the trade mark. Section 137 is not a primary empowering provision conferring rights of action in the applicant. It is permissive in the context in which it appears. Those rights are conferred by s 20 and the provisions of Part 12 of the Trade Marks Act . Section 137 recognises that a trade mark owner may elect to bring proceedings and ss 136 and 137 address what is to occur in the circumstances of those sections in respect of seized goods if the relevant steps are not taken. However, the provisions should be read subject to an order that might be made under s 137(5) to, in effect, preserve the status quo in circumstances where the Court is satisfied that there is a prima facie case of infringement. Nevertheless, a question arises as to whether it is appropriate to make an order directed to the Customs CEO preventing the goods from being released, in all the circumstances, in the exercise of discretion, when s 136 imposes a statutory obligation upon the Customs CEO to release the goods in the circumstances there identified and s 137 imposes time constraints. That directs attention to the merits. In this case, I am satisfied having regard to the affidavit of Ms Kelly Gardner and the matters deposed to by Mr Grigson, that a prima facie case or serious question to be tried is made out on the substantive question for the purposes of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006) 227 CLR 57 (particularly at [65] to [72]). Having regard to that matter, I am satisfied that an injunction order ought to be made directed to the first respondent. The affidavit of Ms Gardner also deposes to a conversation she had with the first respondent in which the first respondent confirmed his address for receipt of particular material and said that he had signed and would return straightaway a form effecting a forfeiture of the particular articles. That did not occur. The conversation suggests plainly an inference that the respondent accepts that the goods are counterfeit goods. The notice in question is a Notice of Consent to Forfeit Goods under Part 13 the Trade Marks Act . Being satisfied of those matters and particularly having regard to the paragraphs of Ms Gardner's affidavit, namely, paragraphs 30 to 33, taken in conjunction with paragraph 3, I am satisfied that although only two of the articles are the subject of the counterfeit analysis by her, an inference arises that if two of the articles, depicted in the material, are established as counterfeit articles, then the remaining eight articles making up the bundle of 10 articles the subject of the notice, would also be likely to be counterfeit articles. Being satisfied of those matters, it is appropriate to make an order restraining the first respondent in terms of the proposed interlocutory injunction. Since the articles are demonstrated on the material, at least at the standard of a serious question to be tried or prima facie case, to be counterfeit articles, it seems to me that the status quo ought to be preserved by making an order directed to the Customs CEO not to release the counterfeit articles into the hands of the designated owner. I am satisfied that in light of the serious question to be tried, an order ought to be made under s 137(5) , both having regard to its intersection with s 136(1) and its context within Part 13 more generally and the circumstances to be determined in the proceedings. However, a serious question of construction will also arise to be determined at trial. Accordingly, it seems to me that it is appropriate to make the interlocutory order contemplated by paragraph 2 of the claim for interlocutory orders. The interlocutory orders provide for liberty to apply three days notice.

Section 44 provides that a party to a proceeding before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal may appeal to the Federal Court of Australia, on a question of law, from any decision of the Tribunal in that proceeding. The appellant's appeal relates to a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dated 27 February 2008. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed a decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal of 18 May 2007 which itself affirmed a decision of Centrelink to recover compensation affected payments in the amount of $32,161.47. 2 The appellant's notice of appeal contains three grounds said to make the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's decision wrong with the questions of law being or relating to the following matters: (1) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in paragraphs 13 to 15 of its reasons, referred to the wrong decision not being the subject of the present matter. (2) Allowing two different decisions in the one application was incorrect as under s 65A of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) impairment from psychological/psychiatric injuries should be assessed separately from physical injury. (3) The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was not aware why the appellant had appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 3 The appellant supported his appeal with written and oral submissions. The appellant's oral submissions dealt with numerous issues not covered by the notice of appeal or written submissions. The appellant also challenged the Administrative Appeals Tribunal's findings about the issue of \"special circumstances\" under s 1184K of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth). 4 To understand the appellant's claims it is necessary to identify (albeit briefly) the relevant statutory context. Section 1173 of the Social Security Act provides for a reduction of \"compensation affected\" social security payments. That is, social security payments are reduced if a person is also receiving compensation (as defined in s 17(2)(b) of the Act). Section 1184K provides that the whole or part of a compensation payment may be treated as not having been made if the Secretary of the Department thinks it appropriate to do so in the special circumstances of the case. 5 On 14 November 2006 Centrelink notified the appellant that his social security payments would be subject to a charge of $32,161.47 on account of his receipt of workers compensation payments. The appellant appealed against this decision. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal affirmed the decision on 18 May 2007. The appellant appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 7 June 2007. As noted, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed the decision on 27 February 2008. 6 There are two primary difficulties for the appellant in the present appeal. 7 First, the decision under review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was the decision with respect to the recovery of $32,161.47, being compensation affected payments. The first ground of appeal relates to an alleged error by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about the relevant decision of the Workers Compensation Commission. However, it is clear from the documents relied upon by the Tribunal that the Workers Compensation Commission made a determination on 4 May 2006 (the decision the appellant identifies as relevant in the notice of appeal) and 27 July 2006 which was subject to appeal insofar as the refusal of the claim for psychological impairment was concerned. On 18 October 2006 (the date to which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal referred in its reasons) the appeal was determined. The arbitrator confirmed the decisions of 4 May 2006 and 27 July 2006 subject to some additional findings. Hence, all of the references in the notice of appeal and appellant's submissions about the reasons of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal relating to the wrong decision are without foundation. 8 Secondly, and in any event, none of the appeal grounds raise any question of law with respect to the proceeding that was before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The respondent filed and served a notice of objection to competency as a result. An appeal lies only on a question of law being \"one to which a favourable answer would reveal an error affecting the [Administrative Appeals Tribunal's] decision concerning\" the appellant ( Croker v Secretary, Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations [2008] FCA 971 at [17] citing Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2003] FCAFC 232 ; (2003) 76 ALD 321 at 327). None of the appeal grounds pose any question of law of this kind. The first appeal ground makes an assertion about the relevant decision. The second appears to be a complaint about the decision of the Workers Compensation Commission, which was not the decision subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The third, insofar as it can be understood, asserts that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal was not aware of the way in which the appellant put his case. This appears to be a version of the first ground which cannot be sustained for the reasons given. 9 As noted, the appellant's oral submissions raised numerous issues. The appellant submitted that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal prevented him from using the interpreter all of the time and this led to numerous errors in the decision. The transcript and reasons for decision do not support this submission. The extent to which the interpreter was used was essentially a matter for the appellant. The appellant submitted that Centrelink and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal had the wrong dates relating to payments and misunderstood the nature of the payments by the insurer to Centrelink. To the extent this raises an issue different from the matters addressed above the issue is one of fact and raises no question of law. The same conclusion applies to the appellant's submission that he was not properly notified of the relevant dates on which decisions were made. 10 The appellant's other submissions (such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal allegedly discussing the case with the Workers Compensation Commission, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal not considering certain documents or misunderstanding the law) are not supported by the reasons for decision. 11 The appellant's submissions included reference to the way in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal dealt with the claim for special circumstances under s 1184K. Those submissions (including about his liability with respect to tax on his compensation payment) also do not disclose any question of law. Factual matters are within the discretion of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. 12 Insofar as the appellant said that he had not had an opportunity to present all of his evidence to this Court, I note that the appeal was fixed for hearing on 9 September 2008. The appellant also said he was waiting for advice from a barrister and wanted legal representation by a referral under Order 80 of the Federal Court Rules but such an order is a discretionary matter for the Court. I am satisfied that the appellant has had an adequate opportunity to present his case and identify any question of law he claims affects the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. No such question has been identified. 13 For these reasons the respondent's notice of objection to the competency of the appeal must be upheld and the appeal dismissed.

The Tribunal's decision, handed down on 27 July 2004, affirmed the decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister to refuse to grant the appellant a protection visa. The Tribunal's decision involved a redetermination of the appellant's claims consequent to an order for redetermination made by the Federal Magistrates Court on 15 March 2004 (see SZAIX v Minister for Immigration [2004] FMCA 104). The Tribunal had first determined the matter against the appellant in a decision handed down on 4 April 2003 which was subsequently set aside on judicial review. A twice-raped, ethnic Chinese and Christian Indonesian woman 2 The appellant claims to possess a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion and membership of a particular social group, said to be either Indonesian women or Chinese Christian women in Indonesia. The Tribunal accepted that the appellant was raped on two separate occasions a few weeks before leaving Indonesia and arriving in Australia in July 2001. At the time of the first sexual assault, the appellant's attacker told her not to inform the police of his actions lest he harm her again. The appellant's father and brother nevertheless complained to the police. The appellant then moved to the home of her relatives. She claimed that she was stalked by her attacker. The second sexual assault was carried out by the same attacker and another man. The appellant claimed that her rapists were Muslim men. She also claimed they were policemen. The appellant claimed her fear of persecution arose from the rapes. The appellant claimed to fear that she will be raped again should she return to Indonesia, either by the man who raped her on both occasions, or by Muslim men. Leave to raise new grounds of appeal 3 The appellant sought leave to raise grounds of appeal not argued in the Federal Magistrates Court. She did not press the ground argued in the Federal Magistrates Court. 4 The amended notice of appeal in substance raises three new matters. These are: 1. That the Tribunal applied the wrong test, as follows: (a) that the Tribunal misunderstood the test for assessing whether women in Indonesia were a particular social group and thereby failed to ask itself the right question when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under section 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act'); (b) that the Tribunal failed to consider whether there was a failure of effective State protection in respect of the appellant for a ground under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva, on 28 July 1951 (1954 ATS 5) ('the Convention') and therefore failed to consider an essential integer of her claim; and (c) that the Tribunal misunderstood the test for assessing whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to another part of Indonesia by failing to assess the practical realities of the appellant's relocation. It thereby failed to ask itself the right questions when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under section 36 of the Act. 2. Further, or in the alternative to 1(c) above, that the Tribunal failed to take into account relevant considerations when assessing whether it was reasonable to expect the appellant to relocate to another part of Indonesia. These relevant considerations were: (a) the fact that in Indonesia the appellant was a single mother responsible for two children who would have no family support or protection if she moved away from Jakarta; (b) the fact that the appellant had been raped twice; (c) the fact that the incidence of rape of women and children in Indonesia generally is a serious problem; and (d) the fact that in other parts of Indonesia prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians may be stronger than in Jakarta. This led to a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself the right questions when determining whether or not the appellant was owed protection obligations under s 36 of the Act. 3. That by reason of the matters set out above the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error. 5 In addition to the formal application to raise new grounds, other questions were debated at the hearing (for convenience I continue the numbering from the previous paragraph): 4. Did the Tribunal fail to take relevant considerations into account or misunderstand the evidence concerning the appellant's claim to possess a well-founded fear of persecution as an ethnic Chinese and Christian woman? 5. Did the Tribunal misunderstand the correct test, or ask the wrong question, for determining whether reasonably effective State protection was available against the feared persecution? 6. Did the Tribunal fail to apply the correct legal test, or fail to take relevant considerations into account, on the question of the availability of State protection, in relation to future protection by the police? 6 The appellant was legally represented at the hearing before the Federal Magistrates Court, but submitted in this Court that the new grounds were not raised there in circumstances where her solicitor's grasp of the legal complexities appeared to be less than fully adequate. The appellant submitted, and the first respondent ('Minister') agreed, that where it is expedient and in the interests of justice to grant leave to raise new grounds on appeal, the Court should do so. The appellant cited VUAX v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 at [46] (' VUAX' ) (and the cases there cited) in support of her request for leave. 7 However, the Minister submitted that it was open to the appellant's solicitor in the Federal Magistrates Court to consider whether to raise the grounds now sought to be argued, and that the solicitor did so consider. An appeal should not become an inquiry into the quality of the legal advice received by a party at first instance. The Minister directed the Court's attention to paragraphs [16]-[18] of the Full Court's decision in Iyer v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1788 (' Iyer '), in which the Full Court canvassed relevant authorities on this issue. Of note is the discussion by R D Nicholson J in Jones v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1995) 63 FCR 32 (' Jones '), where his Honour observed at 47: '...The effect of [the] authorities, as I view them, is that where the new grounds could possibly have been met by calling evidence at the hearing or may have resulted in the case of the respondent being differently conducted at the trial, leave will be refused (the first proposition). However, where all the facts have been established beyond controversy or where the point is one of construction or of law, then it is a question for the Court of Appeal whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice to entertain the point (the second proposition). ... ... The authorities...while stressing the importance of the public interest in ensuring the finality of litigation, do not view that interest as likely to be paramount where the new grounds are within the second proposition. Lord Watson in Connecticut [ Fire Insurance Co v Cavanaugh [1892] AC 473] at 480 said that in the case of the second proposition \"it is not only competent but expedient in the interests of justice, to entertain the plea\". The rule derives, at least in part, \"from public policy considerations directed to ensuring the finality of litigation\" and, so far as it does so derive, \"the relevant consideration is that the case sought to be made on appeal is a new or different case from that which emerged at the trial\": Banque Commerciale SA [(En liq) v Akhil Holdings Ltd [1990] HCA 11 ; (1990) 169 CLR 279] at 284. ' 8 The Minister submitted that on this issue the Court must have regard to the interest held by her, and through her, the Australian people, in the finality of the procedures put in place for the determination of entitlements to protection visas. In addition, the Court should have regard to the protection of the 'structure and integrity of the appellate process' (see Iyer at [23]), to which it is relevant, though not determinative, that the appellant failed to comply with Court deadlines for providing reasons why the grounds were not raised below, and particulars of the arguments relied upon. 9 The appellant argued that her request for leave is supported by these factors: the facts are not in dispute and there is no possible need to admit new evidence for the new grounds (as in Coulton v Holcombe [1986] HCA 33 ; (1986) 162 CLR 1) (' Coulton '); granting leave would not be an effective grant of a new trial (also as in Coulton ); and the new grounds raised were involved as parts of the appellant's claim before the Tribunal. She referred to Jones , where, as here, there was an express disavowal of grounds by the relevant legal representative, but the Court nevertheless granted the appellant leave to raise new grounds. 10 At the hearing, counsel for the appellant relied on Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Limited [1997] HCA 1 ; (1997) 189 CLR 146, suggesting that it is authority for the principle that the requirements of case management are relevant considerations, but they cannot be used to prevent a party from arguing a ground that is fairly arguable. Further, counsel suggested that there is a level of disagreement in this Court regarding the approach to be taken to this issue. In doing so, counsel referred to the judgment of Allsop J in Branir v Owston Nominees (No 2) [2001] FCA 1833 ; (2001) 117 FCR 424 at 440, in which his Honour expressly declined to comment on the approach taken by Branson and Katz JJ in H v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2000) 63 ALD 43. In that case, their Honours gave consideration to the merits of the new grounds to be raised. On this point, counsel also referred to the discussion in VUAX at [48] where, it appears, the Full Court accepted that the merits of the new grounds are to be given consideration. The appellant argued that a party should be permitted to raise an arguable case provided any prejudice to other parties could be compensated by costs. In addition, the appellant referred to the judgment of R D Nicholson J in Jones , where his Honour stated (at 48) that whether or not the Immigration Review Tribunal had complied with its statutory duty 'raises a point of law in the interests of justice which supports and outweighs, in all the circumstances, the public interest in the finality of litigation in these particular circumstances'. Jenkinson J (with whom Carr J agreed) similarly stated (at 37) that the '[o]bservance of such [statutory] requirements by a tribunal administering important and publicly scrutinised immigration laws should be encouraged by this Court. A determination whether...the Tribunal satisfied those requirements is in my opinion expedient and in the interests of justice. ' 11 In NAJT v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 134 I gave my views as follows (at [162]-[166]), Conti J generally agreeing: 'Quite apart from a power to receive new evidence, what is the position of an appellate court rehearing a matter as to questions of law available on the materials before the trial judge but not raised at first instance? An appellant wishing to raise fresh legal questions cannot, in the first place, be in a worse position than one seeking to augment the evidence itself. Secondly, a party victorious at first instance is, in any case, liable to be defeated by a change in the law occurring before the appeal is heard; that, indeed, is conventionally given as the main practical difference between a \"strict\" appeal and one by way of rehearing. The result of a new legal point being successfully raised is no harder for the litigant thereby defeated than if the defeat follows from some legal point newly raised. Thirdly, however, there is undoubtedly great, general value in considerations of finality of litigation acting as a brake on appellate intervention, thereby preserving the integrity of the trial as the normal arena for final disposition of that case. As a general statement of principle there is no conflict between what the Full Court approved in Branir and the approach in the cases next referred to. In my respectful view, the correct approach, and the one generally adopted in practice in this Court, is that succinctly expressed in VUAX v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158 (\" VUAX \") by Kiefel, Weinberg and Stone JJ (at [46] --- [48]): \"Leave to argue a ground of appeal not raised before the primary judge should only be granted if it is expedient in the interests of justice to do so: O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33 ; (1982) 150 CLR 310; H v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs ; and Branir ... at [20]-[24] and [38]. In Coulton ..., Gibbs CJ, Wilson, Brennan and Dawson JJ observed, in their joint judgment, at 7 : 'It is fundamental to the due administration of justice that the substantial issues between the parties are ordinarily settled at the trial. If it were not so the main arena for the settlement of disputes would move from the court of first instance to the appellate court, tending to reduce the proceedings in the former court to little more than a preliminary skirmish. ' The practice of raising arguments for the first time before the Full Court has been particularly prevalent in appeals relating to migration matters. The Court may grant leave if some point that was not taken below, but which clearly has merit, is advanced, and there is no real prejudice to the respondent in permitting it to be agitated. Where, however, there is no adequate explanation for the failure to take the point, and it seems to be of doubtful merit, leave should generally be refused. \" (Emphasis added. ) To similar effect, in Iyer ... Heerey, Moore and Goldberg JJ said (at [22] --- [24]): \"... We recognise that there is a particular sensitivity in refugee cases where an adverse decision may have very serious consequences for an applicant. Although it is in the interests of justice that decisions be made on the true merits of the case sought to be argued, the structure and integrity of the appellate process must also be taken into consideration. It is incumbent upon parties bringing applications to the Court to review decisions of tribunals such as the [Tribunal] to make it clear from the outset what are the substantive grounds of review relied upon .... However, in order to determine whether it is expedient and in the interests of justice that leave be given to argue new grounds it is necessary to give some consideration to the merits of the grounds raised . That does not mean that an appellate court should enter upon a full consideration of the grounds. To do so would make the requirement for leave meaningless. It is sufficient to determine whether the grounds sought to be raised have a reasonable prospect of success. We also consider it appropriate to take into account whether the appellant had the benefit of legal representation at the hearing before the primary judge . \" (Emphasis added. ) ... Thus, relevant questions include: 1) Do the new legal arguments have a reasonable prospect of success? 2) Is there an acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below? 3) How much dislocation to the Court and efficient use of judicial sitting time is really involved? 4) What is at stake in the case for the appellant? 5) Will the resolution of the issues raised have any importance beyond the case at hand? 6) Is there any actual prejudice, not viewing the notion of prejudice narrowly, to the respondent? 7) If so, can it be justly and practicably cured? 8) If not, where, in all the circumstances, do the interests of justice lie? ' (Original emphasis). 12 I proceed to examine the various attacks sought to be raised against the Tribunal's decision. Issue 4: Ethnic Chinese and Christian women in Indonesia as a particular social group 13 The Tribunal accepted that the rapes suffered by the appellant constituted harm of a kind sufficiently serious so as to amount to persecution under s 91R(1)(b) of the Act. The Tribunal further accepted that 'ethnic Chinese women' in Indonesia are a particular social group within the Convention's meaning. 14 However, the Tribunal was not satisfied that the appellant was raped for reasons of her membership of that group. Nor was the Tribunal satisfied that the appellant's fear of future persecution was for this reason. The Tribunal accepted that riots which took place in Indonesia in 1998 were marked by mass rape of ethnic Chinese women but found that the independent sources it consulted 'do not suggest' that the targeting of ethnic Chinese women persisted beyond the 1998 riots. It concluded that there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women are singled out for sexual assault. The Tribunal found that the 'prevalent and indiscriminate nature of such [sexual] attacks suggests that these attacks are opportunistic crimes committed for individualistic reasons against women perceived to be suitable victims'. It found there 'was nothing in the [appellant's] evidence' to lead it to conclude that in committing the rapes, the appellant's attackers were 'essentially and significantly motivated by her membership of the particular social group of ethnic Chinese women'. 15 The Tribunal's findings on this question were as follows: 'The [appellant] claims to be fearful of the man primarily responsible for her rape and sexual assault. The Tribunal has already found that the [appellant] was not attacked for the reason of her religion, ethnicity or membership of a particular social group. The [appellant's] evidence at the hearing regarding the reasons as to why her attacker would want to harm her now was unambiguous. She stated that that the man wants to harm her because he was upset that her father had reported the matter to the police and he wants to take revenge. When she was asked again if the man wanted to harm her in retaliation for her father's complaint, she said yes. In the Tribunal's view, the essential and significant reason for the harm feared by the [appellant] is personal, namely revenge or retaliation for her father's complaint to the police and not any Convention related reason. The Tribunal finds that the harm feared by the [appellant] is not Convention related [sic]. ' 16 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal's reasoning demonstrates that it failed to understand both the nature of this part of her claim and the evidence relating to it. Whilst the Tribunal had said there was 'no evidence' to suggest that ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia are singled out for sexual assault, it did accept there was a 'general vulnerability felt by the ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia'. In light of this acceptance, the Tribunal was obliged to deal with the appellant's claim that ethnic Chinese are likely to be targets of violence, and the evidence in support of that claim. There was evidence that, although government administrations have been more benevolent towards ethnic Chinese since 1998, ethnic Chinese, and Christians, have been targets of violence since that time. The appellant submitted that the Tribunal jurisdictionally erred by not making findings on that evidence (which included a suggestion that Chinese women frequently wore chastity belts, such was their fear of rape), and thereby not considering it relevant in reaching its conclusion on this part of her claim. 17 In concluding that there was no evidence to support a finding that ethnic Chinese women were singled out for sexual assault, the Tribunal referred to evidence submitted by the appellant that according to a non-government organisation 'sexual violence, including rape, mostly against women and children, could take place anywhere and involve anyone regardless of walk of life, education or age'. The appellant submitted that this did not undermine her claim: evidence that many women in Indonesia are at risk of rape does not deny that ethnic Chinese women may possess a well-founded fear of rape on grounds of their being ethnic Chinese. 18 In response, the Minister argued two things. First, that the Court should not read literally the Tribunal's use of the phrase 'no evidence': reading the Tribunal's reasons reasonably beneficially, it is clear enough that the Tribunal meant that there was no evidence it found convincing. Second, and perhaps more importantly, that the validity of the intended ground of the appellant's appeal is immaterial, given that the Tribunal concluded that the essential and significant reason for the future harm feared by the appellant was not related to a Convention reason but was personal: she fears that she will be harmed again by her attacker in revenge for her father's complaint to the police. 19 In my opinion, given the Tribunal's factual findings the Minister's submissions must be upheld. In the first place, the Tribunal's finding as to the true nature of the appellant's fear was a free-standing and sufficient reason to reject her claim to refugee status. (There is a qualification to this as to the claim that, at street level, no adequate State protection via the police is available to the appellant, the lack being attributable to Convention reasons, but this is dealt with below). On that finding, the persecution she feared was not for a Convention reason --- the Tribunal member rejected the hypothesis that the appellant was attacked because she was Chinese. It follows that she could not have been attacked because she was a member of the social group, ethnic Chinese women, found by the Tribunal to exist. 20 Secondly, read as a whole, and beneficially, the Tribunal's reasons sufficiently indicate that by 'no evidence' the Tribunal meant 'no sufficient reason'. Such an assessment was legally within the Tribunal's province. 21 Thirdly, it is now trite that the Tribunal was only required to refer to the evidence it found persuasive and not to explain its rejection of each other piece of evidence. Issue 1(a): Women in Indonesia as a particular social group 22 The appellant claimed that she was persecuted on the grounds of her membership of the particular social group of women in Indonesia. The Tribunal found that women in Indonesia did not constitute a particular social group within the Convention's meaning. The appellant argued that the Tribunal misunderstood the legal test for a 'particular social group'. 23 The Tribunal found that whilst the evidence 'indicates that violence against women in Indonesia is pervasive and women face considerable discrimination in the work place' it also 'suggests Indonesian women are active participants in Indonesian society'. The Tribunal found that Indonesian women participate in education, the work force and politics. Based on a 'country report' from the State Department of the United States of America, the Tribunal stated that whilst the Indonesian Guidelines of State Policy and legal statutes adopted by the MPR (People's Consultative Assembly) state that women's participation in the development process must not conflict with their role in improving family welfare and the education of the younger generation, the Guidelines explicitly state that women have the same rights, obligations, and opportunities as men. The Tribunal then concluded that women in Indonesia are not a particular social group within the meaning of the Convention. Nowhere in the section of the Tribunal's decision headed 'Findings and Reasons' did the Tribunal expressly refer to the question of whether Indonesian women are cohesive or share interests, goals or aspirations. The Tribunal did however, in the course of recording the evidence later referred to by it in its 'Findings and Reasons' on the question of 'a particular social group', record that the appellant was invited at the hearing to comment on the assertion that Indonesian women did not share interests, goals or aspirations but did not so comment. 24 In seeking to determine whether women in Indonesia are 'a particular social group', the Tribunal referred to Applicant A v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [1997] HCA 4 ; (1997) 190 CLR 225, and quoted the following passage from the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Kirby JJ in Applicant S v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2004] HCA 25 ; (2004) 217 CLR 387 (' Applicant S ') at [36]: '...First, the group must be identifiable by a characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group. Secondly, the characteristic or attribute common to all members of the group cannot be the shared fear of persecution. Thirdly, the possession of that characteristic or attribute must distinguish the group from society at large. Borrowing the language of Dawson J in Applicant A , a group that fulfils the first two propositions, but not the third, is merely a \"social group\" and not a \"particular social group\". ' (Footnotes omitted. ) The Tribunal then took the following approach to the question of whether 'a particular social group' exists: 'Whether a supposed group is a \"particular social group\" in a society will depend upon all of the evidence including relevant information regarding legal, social, cultural and religious norms in the country. ' 25 The appellant did not challenge the correctness of the approach to 'a particular social group' stated by the Tribunal. However, she argued that the Tribunal manifestly misunderstood that approach. The appellant submitted that the written reasons of the Tribunal demonstrate that in considering the third matter identified in the quote from Applicant S above (ie whether the social group was distinguishable from the rest of society), the Tribunal actually tested whether women in Indonesia were cohesive or 'share interests, goals or aspirations'. The appellant pointed out that cohesiveness is not a necessary element of a particular social group; thus the Tribunal misunderstood the test to be applied. The Minister argued that the Tribunal's written reasons on 'a particular social group' demonstrate that the Tribunal gave significance to the integration of women into civil society and the conferral on them of the same rights and obligations as men, and not the cohesiveness or otherwise of Indonesian women as a social group. 26 A fair reading of the Tribunal's reasons as a whole does not leave me with the impression that the Tribunal, under cover of silence, applied a test of whether women in Indonesian were cohesive or shared interests, goals or aspirations. Decision-makers, including judges, often raise issues and considerations in the course of a hearing that ultimately do not form part of their reasoning. So it was, in my opinion, here. 27 Further, the appellant is faced with the problem that the Tribunal concluded that the information it accepted 'does not indicate that perpetrators of sexual assault in Indonesia engage in this form of abhorrent criminal activity as a means of harming or persecuting ethnic Chinese women (or women) per se for that matter ' (the emphasis is mine but the punctuation is as in the original). Thereby, notwithstanding its finding that women in Indonesia are not a particular social group, the Tribunal appears to have concluded that, if they were, perpetrators of sexual assault do not commit their crimes as a matter of persecuting women as such. The appellant asserts that the parenthetical 'allusion' to women in the Tribunal's conclusion is not sufficient to constitute a finding on this question, but I see no reason to read down what the Tribunal Member clearly enough said. The mispunctuation leads nowhere. Issues 1(b), 5 and 6: The unavailability for Convention reasons of State protection against the feared persecution 28 After rejecting the appellant's claims that her rapists were policemen, the Tribunal found: 'The independent evidence...indicates that the state authorities are attempting to address the prevalence of rape in Indonesia by identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crises centres. According to the US State Department, in 2003 there was a 25 percent increase in the rape cases tallied by the Jakarta police. Rape is punishable by 4 to 12 years in jail, and the Government jailed perpetrators for rape and attempted rape. During 2003, many police stations set up a \"special crisis room\" (RPK), where female officers received criminal reports from sexual assault victims. There is an active NGO movement in the country which is constantly raising awareness and assists in police in addressing the problem of sexual assault [sic] '. 29 The Tribunal concluded that the Indonesian authorities do not 'generally' promote, condone, or permit the persecution of, or 'withhold reasonable protection' from, Chinese, Christians or ethnic Chinese and Christian women. It referred to evidence that recently a police chief in West Jakarta was replaced for allegedly blackmailing traders of traditional Chinese medicines. The Tribunal said that '[t]here was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of \"ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia\". ' The Tribunal was 'satisfied that if the [appellant] were to face harm from private individuals, adequate and effective state protection is available to her'. 30 The appellant submitted that, even if, upon analysis, she feared persecution only by a non-State actor for non-Convention reasons, the Tribunal erred by failing to consider whether there had been a failure by the Indonesian authorities, for Convention reasons, to provide protection to her. The appellant relied on the observation in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S152/2003 (2004) 205 ALR 487 (' S152 ') that a state's inability to control the conduct of its police force may amount to a sufficient reason for a person to be unwilling to avail herself of the protection of her country of nationality once outside the country. That, however, assumes that a Convention reason is implicated. In oral submissions, the appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal applied the correct test, it would have been open to it to conclude that the failure by the authorities to protect the appellant was for a Convention reason: the High Court's decision in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Khawar [2002] HCA 14 ; (2002) 210 CLR 1 (' Khawar ') is authority for the proposition that criminal activity committed by a private individual, which is tolerated or condoned by the State because it systematically discriminates on Convention grounds, may amount to persecution. 31 In considering whether effective state protection was available, the appellant submitted that the Tribunal was required to consider whether there was a reasonably effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice: see S152 at [26]. The appellant argued that the Tribunal's reasoning reveals no consideration of whether effective state protection was available to the appellant 'on the ground' or at a 'micro' level, as was required: the question was, what would be available as a practical matter to a woman in the position of the appellant? 32 The appellant submitted that, had the Tribunal really questioned whether there was an effective and impartial police force and a reasonably impartial system of justice, as required by S152 , it would have dealt with the suggestion by the appellant's father that the police had not responded to his complaint of his daughter's rape because she is Chinese, and that the appellant was raped again after the complaint. 33 The Minister conceded that the evidence dealt with by the Tribunal on the issue of state protection consisted of 'broad' considerations of what the state was attempting to do to remedy the problems of rape in Indonesia. However, the Minister submitted, that does not betoken jurisdictional error. The Tribunal was under no obligation to recite every piece of evidence before it, and especially not required to recite evidence it found unconvincing on an issue. The Tribunal's conclusion that the Indonesian authorities do not 'generally' withhold protection should not be 'parsed' in order to concoct supposed error: Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272. The Convention does not require absolute protection or guarantees against harm, as was correctly observed by the Tribunal in reaching its conclusion on the issue. 34 The Minister further argued that in a case of persecution by non-state agents the question of state protection may be relevant at three stages of the inquiry: whether the fear is well-founded; whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution, and; whether the appellant is unable, or, owing to fear of persecution, unwilling, to avail herself of the protection of her state: S152 per Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ at [21]. It was for this reason that the High Court allowed an appeal from the judgment of the Full Court of the Federal Court in S152 that turned on a finding, similar to the appellant's argument in this appeal, that the Tribunal erred in failing to determine whether there was protection available 'in a practical sense'. 35 However, while the 'ability of the state to discharge its obligation to protect its citizens', may , as counsel for the Minister submitted, be relevant at three stages of the inquiry, it is here, in my view, relevant to the second question identified by Gleeson CJ, Hayne and Heydon JJ, viz 'whether the conduct giving rise to the fear is persecution' (at [21]). If the state, despite the good intentions of its leaders, is not able, at what might be called the operational or grass-roots level, to have its operatives provide an acceptable level of protection against serious harm, and the dereliction of those operatives has as its basis their discrimination of a Convention kind against the appellant, that situation, as Hale LJ put it in Horvath v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000] 1 NLR 15, 'may turn the acts of others [ie non-state actors] into persecution for a Convention reason' (at 52 and quoted with approval by Lord Hope of Craighead in the appeal to the House of Lords (see [2000] UKHL 37 ; [2001] 1 AC 489 at 497)). 36 So much was uncontroversial in S152 . S152 was a case where harm had been inflicted by non-state actors for Convention reasons. The majority in the High Court took the view that (at [26]): ' [n] o country can guarantee that its citizens will at all times, and in all circumstances, be safe from violence. Day by day, Australian courts deal with criminal cases involving violent attacks on person or property. Some of them may occur for reasons of racial or religious intolerance. The religious activities in which the first respondent engaged ... evidently aroused the anger of some other people. Their response was unlawful. The Ukrainian state was obliged to take reasonable measures to protect the lives and safety of its citizens, and those measures would include an appropriate criminal law, and the provision of a reasonably effective and impartial police force and justice system. None of the country information before the tribunal justified a conclusion that there was a failure on the part of Ukraine to conform to its obligations in that respect. ' 37 In the present case, by contrast, (if the matter were sufficiently raised by the appellant), although the serious harm done to her by a non-state agent was not itself inflicted for a Convention reason, she might nevertheless be refugee if, for Convention reasons, namely, anti-Chinese racism merging into antipathy for Chinese women considered as a social group exhibited by the local police, the State failed, to provide a 'reasonably effective and impartial police force' (cf S152 at [26]) at a grass-roots level. That is, the State's weakness or incompetence, whatever its leaders' good intention, in having its norms carried out, might have permitted the local police to engage in Convention persecution themselves, by failure (for Convention reasons) to prevent and act against those who would cause the appellant serious harm. 38 As I read S152 , nothing in it, or otherwise in principle, denies that such a claim, if made out, may constitute the appellant a refugee. She would be in her predicament because of the risk of serious harm coming to her for a Convention reason. As the Convention definition puts it (see Article 1(A)(2)), she would be: '...owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for [Convention reasons] ... outside the country of [her] nationality and ... , owing to such fear ... unwilling to avail [herself] of the protection of that country'. 39 As the 'Michigan Guidelines', developed by Professor Hathaway and others, put it: 'The causal link between the applicant's predicament and a Convention ground will be revealed by evidence of the reasons which led either to the infliction or threat of a relevant harm, or which cause the applicant's country of origin to withhold effective protection in the face of a privately inflicted risk. Attribution of the Convention ground to the applicant by the state or non-governmental agent of persecution is sufficient to establish the required causal connection. ' (See: Hathaway, 'The Michigan Guidelines on Nexus to a Convention Ground', Michigan Journal of International Law (2002) vol 23, pp 211-222 at 215. ) 40 More specifically and authoritatively, in Khawar it was recognised that, as Gleeson CJ put it (at [30] --- [31]): 'The references in the authorities to state agents of persecution and non-state agents of persecution should not be understood as constructing a strict dichotomy. Persecution may also result from the combined effect of the conduct of private individuals and the state or its agents; and a relevant form of state conduct may be tolerance or condonation of the inflicting of serious harm in circumstances where the state has a duty to provide protection against such harm. As was noted earlier, this is not a case in which it is necessary to deal with mere inability to provide protection; this is a case of alleged tolerance and condonation. In Ex parte Shah , Lord Hoffmann, in giving the example of the Jewish shopkeeper set upon with impunity by business rivals in Nazi Germany, referred to the failure of the authorities to provide protection, based upon race, as an \"element in the persecution\". The same expression was used by Lord Hope of Craighead in the passage from Horvath quoted above. Where persecution consists of two elements, the criminal conduct of private citizens, and the toleration or condonation of such conduct by the state or agents of the state, resulting in the withholding of protection which the victims are entitled to expect, then the requirement that the persecution be by reason of one of the Convention grounds may be satisfied by the motivation of either the criminals or the state. In relation to the case which Ms Khawar seeks to make out, the decision in Ex parte Shah in this respect is directly in point. If her contentions, as to which no findings have yet been made, are correct, then Ms Khawar was being abused by her husband and his relatives for personal reasons, but her likely subjection to further abuse without state protection is by reason of her membership of a particular social group , if it be the case that women in Pakistan may be so described. ' (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added. ) See also Khawar at [79]-[80], [87] and [114] ff. 41 S152 effected no modification of Khawar . 42 I turn now to the question: was the claim that the police at the local level had treated the appellant's complaint of rape with less than due seriousness for Convention reasons sufficiently raised so as to require the Tribunal to deal with it? In my opinion it was. 43 The Tribunal had before it material from the appellant's father which she and her father had wished to have considered by the relevant Australian authorities. Her father suggested that he was treated differently and less favourably, when he complained, by the local police, Muslims, because he was Chinese. It was elsewhere asserted in the materials relied on by the appellant that all the police are Muslims. The Refugee Advice and Casework Service (Australia) Inc ('RACS') had submitted on behalf of the appellant that she 'fears that the police and authorities in Indonesia will not protect her because of the fact she is a Christian Chinese...'. Her solicitor had also submitted that the appellant's father had provided a statement detailing his experience with the police: 'He reported the matter to the police who took no action, he opined that it was due to the fact that he and his daughter were Chinese whereas the police and the rapist were Muslim. ' The appellant's solicitor, citing Khawar (at [29]), submitted that '[o]n its face, this is a further case of persecution. Even if the original rape was not for a convention reason, the failure of the authorities to investigate and take action in respect of the rape can amount to persecution if such inaction was motivated by questions of race. ' The Tribunal Member who first heard the appellant's case recorded that the appellant had 'also stated that her father and brother had reported the assault to the police but they took no action. The Indonesian authorities were not interested in protecting her. ' The Tribunal Member asked the appellant 'how, in her view, the police could have done anything without more information. ' According to the Member, the appellant did not respond to that question, but 'reiterated that the complaint was ignored because she was of Chinese descent so was ignored. There were fights between Muslims and Chinese Christians. ' 44 The Tribunal appears to have accepted the appellant's claim that her attacker was a threat to her on account of her complaint to the police. It was also apparently accepted, at least, that the appellant had been raped; that this had been reported to the police; that they had, at best, done nothing useful directed towards apprehending the rapist, and that she had been raped again by the same man on account of the complaint to the police. 45 In such circumstances, it behoved the Tribunal, in light of the several ways in which the appellant put her case, to examine whether the appellant might qualify for refugee status. There is nothing abstruse or indirect in the proposition, which readily springs to mind, that despite anti-racist sentiments expressed and progress initiated at the highest levels of government, these may have had little effect at local police level. 46 This question should have been considered but was not. It is true that the Tribunal found that: ' [T] he independent evidence ... indicates that the state authorities are attempting to address the prevalence of rape in Indonesia by identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crisis centres. ... During 2003, many police stations set up a \"special crisis room\" (RPK), where female officers received criminal reports from sexual assault victims. There is an active NGO movement in the country which is constantly raising awareness and assists in police addressing the problem of sexual assault [sic] . ' 47 Apparently on that basis, the Tribunal continued: 'The evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the Indonesian authorities do not generally promote, condone or permit persecution of [Chinese] , Christians or ethnic Chinese and Christian women in Indonesia or withhold reasonable protection, regardless of the position of the perpetrators. The Tribunal notes that according to the US Department of State recently a police chief in West Jakarta was replaced for allegedly blackmailing traders of traditional Chinese medicines (see for example Country Reports on Human Rights Practices --- 2003, released by Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and labour, US Department of State, February 2004). The Tribunal is satisfied that if the [appellant] were to face harm from private individuals, adequate and effective state protection is available to her. The Convention does not require absolute protection of an individual and state protection by no means implies that the authorities must or can provide absolute guarantees against harm ( Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs v Respondents S157/2003 [2004] HCA 18 at [26] and [28]). There was nothing in the independent evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that the [appellant] will be denied state protection for the reason of her ethnicity, religion or her membership of a particular social group of \"ethnic Chinese women in Indonesia\". ' 48 However, the appellant's claims and submissions mandated an inquiry into the prospect that she might be denied reasonable protection from the police charged with responsibilities in the area where she lived. That question is distinct from whether at high levels or in other places in Indonesia the authorities were generally doing their reasonable, non-racist best. Material from her father and from the appellant supported the proposition that the police at local level would treat her less favourably than indigenous Indonesians. The extent to which actual and practical, as distinct from legal, discrimination might operate against Chinese people, including women complaining of rape, appears to have provoked little, if any information at all as a result of the Tribunal's inquiries. It appears not to have been, as it should have been, an actual focus of those inquiries. 49 Plainly the appellant's complaint about the local police, in the context of much material to suggest deep wells of anti-Chinese feeling in Muslim Indonesia, was not answered merely by reference to changes for the better at high levels of public administration in Indonesia since the departure of President Soeharto. That the contemporary leaders of a society have enlightened views may say nothing about the situation at the level of grass-roots policing. Nor was it answered, as the Minister submitted, by reference to measures, apparently instituted in some localities, to address the general problem of rape by 'identifying the problem of under-reporting and establishing crisis centres'. The official encouragement of the reporting of rapes generally carries no implication that subsequent investigation would proceed on a basis that was not ethnically discriminatory. Encouragement of Indonesians generally to report rape to local police is one thing, the investigation by local police of reports by Chinese Indonesians is another. 50 The unexamined question was, in my opinion, sufficiently clearly an integer of her case to require consideration. If it was not clearly and expressly so asserted in the ways referred to at [44] above, in my view it clearly arose on the materials before the Tribunal. In NABE v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 219 ALR 27 (' NABE ') the Full Court said (at [61]): 'We are of the view that the observations by Merkel J in Paramananthan , by the Full Courts in Sellamuthu and Sarrazola (No 2) and by Cooper J in SDAQ are consistent with the proposition that the tribunal is not required to consider a case that is not expressly made or does not arise clearly on the materials before it. The tribunal's obligation is not limited to procedural fairness in responding to expressly articulated claims but, as is apparent from Dranichnikov , extends to reviewing the delegate's decision on the basis of all the materials before it. ' 51 Earlier the Full Court had approved (at [60]) some pertinent observations by Selway J in SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17]-[18] : '...But this does not mean that the application is to be treated as an exercise in nineteenth century pleading. ... The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it. ' It would be strange if a claimant of refugee status were to be denied a right to have the substance of her claim considered, including the different ways in which the Convention might apply to her, because she had failed clearly to analyse those ways in her application and supporting material, although she had clearly enough delineated facts that might attract the salvation of the Convention. It is not likely that the Full Court in NABE intended such a thing. The Full Court was absolving the Tribunal from any duty to engage in subtle teasing out of hypotheses that only abstrusely arise from an applicant's account of the circumstances that have led to the claim of refugee status. That is not the position here. 52 In my opinion, nothing in NABE was intended to deny, nor can it be denied, that to determine whether a claim 'clearly arises' on the material before a decision-maker, the decision-maker must fully understand the claim being made. That, in turn, may in some cases make it necessary for the decision-maker to analyse what the appellant has said in terms of possible Convention categories. That was the position here. 53 In my opinion, failure to consider this matter constituted a constructive failure to exercise the Tribunal's jurisdiction. 54 Nevertheless, whether such error ultimately has the effect of invalidating the Tribunal's decision depends on whether there was otherwise an independent, jurisdictionally robust basis, among those found by the Tribunal, for denying the appellant's claim. In particular, the finding that the appellant feared persecution at the hands of one local man and that the appellant could avoid such threat as he might pose by relocating elsewhere in Indonesia is of potential significance here. Issue 1(c): Relocation 55 The Tribunal Member's finding on this issue was: 'Moreover, if the [appellant] remains fearful of her attackers in Jakarta, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is reasonable for the [appellant] to relocate to a different part of Indonesia. The focus of the Convention definition is not upon the protection that the country of nationality might be able to provide in some particular region, but upon a more general notion of protection by that country. The international community is not under an obligation to provide protection outside the borders of the country of nationality if real protection can be found within those borders. Therefore, even if an applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in their home region, the Convention does not provide protection if they could nevertheless avail themselves of the real protection of their country of nationality elsewhere within that country: Randhawa ... per Black CJ at 440-1. The [appellant's] fear of harm is localised in nature. The Tribunal does not accept that the man who assaulted her, although he may have persisted in locating her in Jakarta, would be able to find her anywhere in a densely populated country like Indonesia. When the option of relocation was discussed with the [appellant] at the hearing, she stated that her husband had died, she was defrauded financially and most of her relatives are in Australia. While the Tribunal appreciates that the death of her husband in January 2001 and being financially defrauded soon after made life difficult for her, the [appellant] continued to work as [a real estate] agent until her departure from Indonesia. She also possesses skills as a hairdresser and worked in that profession for many years. In Australia, she was able to work until she was detained and has been able to find resourceful friends who have assisted her throughout her ordeal. The Tribunal did not find her to be as dependent as her witness tried to portray her. She is relatively young, she was working in Indonesia prior to her departure and she has gained additional skills in Australia which would assist her if she were to search for employment opportunities elsewhere in Indonesia. The Tribunal finds that it is reasonable for the [appellant] to relocate internally. ' 56 The present and well-entrenched state of Full Federal Court authority is that a claim to refugee status is not established by those who could reasonably avail themselves of the real protection of the country of nationality elsewhere within their country of nationality: Randhawa v Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1994) 52 FCR 437 (' Randhawa' ) per Black CJ at 440 (cf my remarks in dissent in NALZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 320 ; (2004) 140 FCR 270 at [8] ). The question is whether the person can relocate to another area of the country, and, it is said, whether he or she could reasonably be expected to do so. However, answering this question is influenced by the principle that: 'notwithstanding that real protection from persecution may be available elsewhere within the country of nationality, a person's fear of persecution in relation to that country will remain well-founded with respect to the country as a whole if, as a practical matter, the part of the country in which protection is available is not reasonably accessible to that person' (per Black CJ in Randhawa at 442). 57 The appellant submitted that the Tribunal incorrectly took a general approach that there must be a safe haven somewhere in Indonesia, and did not consider, as a matter of practical reality, the issues raised by the appellant as required ( Randhawa at 443). The appellant submitted that the specific issues which the Tribunal was obliged, but failed to consider were: 1. the psychological difficulties of continuing to live anywhere within a country and culture in which the appellant had experienced rape on two occasions; 2. the appellant's need, as a single mother (her husband having died in January 2001), for the support of her family; 3. the appellant may face discrimination and/or harm living as a single woman with children without any family protection; 4. the appellant has never lived outside Cenkarang (apparently a suburb of Jakarta) in Indonesia as a single woman; and 5. the only family the appellant has who are outside Cenkarang live in Australia. The Tribunal did not advert to the fact that all of the appellant's relatives living in Indonesia live in Cenkarang. 58 The Tribunal also failed to take into account its finding that the incidence of rape of women in Indonesia generally is a problem and the fact of a general social prejudice against ethnic Chinese Indonesians. These are probable issues for the appellant, who would effectively be without family support. In oral submissions counsel added that the Tribunal did not take into account that the appellant may have her children with her if she relocates, unlike her experience in Australia, which had encouraged the Tribunal to regard her as a relatively resilient person. 59 The Minister denied the claim that the Tribunal merely assumed there was a safe haven within Indonesia, and argued that it is for the Tribunal to determine the significant issues in assessing the matter of relocation. It cannot be assumed that, because the Tribunal has failed to refer expressly to an issue, it has failed to consider it. The proper inference is that the issues referred to by counsel for the appellant were not considered by the Tribunal to be as significant as those the Tribunal mentioned. Also, of the issues listed by the appellant's counsel, factors (1) and (3) go to whether the appellant would want to live in Indonesia at all, rather than to whether she could relocate. Issues (2) and (5) concern the appellant's wish to have family support, which was acknowledged by the Tribunal, and issue (4) could properly be considered not to carry great weight, given that the appellant had successfully made her way in the unfamiliar cultural environment in Australia. The brevity, it was submitted, of the Tribunal's reasons on this matter 'does not detract from the breadth of the consideration'. 60 In NAIZ v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural & Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 37 (' NAIZ ') at [22], Branson J (with whom North J agreed) found jurisdictional error on the part of a Tribunal Member who, though acknowledging that internal relocation should be 'reasonable' in the circumstances: '...did not, as ... Randhawa [at] [16] ... requires, give consideration to the practical realities facing the appellant [a widow of advancing years] with respect to accommodation and care should she seek to relocate within Fiji ... the Tribunal was required to give consideration to how, in a practical sense, the appellant could be expected to relocate within Fiji. ' 61 Here, the appellant was a Chinese Christian widow with young children who had been twice raped and who had never lived in Indonesia outside Jakarta. True it is that she was enterprising and employable. But on the material accepted by the Tribunal, anti-Chinese sentiment runs deep in Indonesia and the vulnerability of women to rape appears, from the Tribunal's findings, to be high. 62 It requires little empathy to understand that, although the appellant's precise fear of persecution as identified by the Tribunal relates to one man in Jakarta, she may well now suffer profound psychological difficulty in readjusting to Indonesian society and adjusting to a new place of residence in Indonesia at some place where, ex hypothesi , she appears likely to have no close family support. To observe that she had suffered an 'ordeal', yet appeared capable in Australia, where the social environment is entirely different and she has family support, is simply not to acknowledge the major difficulty in the 'practical realities', both psychological and physical, that now would confront her if returned to Indonesia. Who would befriend her? What support, if any, would be available? Would she be able to speak freely about her troubles (there is a suggestion in her materials, unexplored by the Tribunal, that even in Chinese-Indonesian circles shame attaches to a sexually assaulted woman)? Is a Chinese widow on her own in Indonesia especially apt to attract unwelcome sexual advances? 63 If a matter is not mentioned in a Tribunal's findings, this entitles a court to infer that the matter was not considered by the Tribunal to be material ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30 ; (2001) 206 CLR 323 per McHugh, Gummow, Hayne JJ (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) at [69]). That the Tribunal Member engaged in no discussion of questions of those kinds suggests that the psychological aspects of the practical realities facing the appellant were not present to his mind. Given the strangeness of such matters not having been mentioned if they were considered, in my view it is appropriate to draw the inference that they were not considered. I do not wish to seem overcritical. The appellant's case was not a simple one. She had, according to the Tribunal, embroidered some facts and the Tribunal Member thought that a friend who gave evidence was suggesting that, even in the Australian context, she was less robust a person than the Tribunal considered her to be. Nevertheless, it is notorious that in the last 20 years or so the high potential for sexual assault, let alone repeated instances of it, to cause the victim serious psychological difficulties, has become widely accepted. I think that the kinds of potential difficulties to which I have referred were overlooked. There has in my opinion been, as in NAIZ , a failure by the Tribunal to ask itself (as Branson J put it) 'the right questions'. 64 It follows that there has been, on that account, given also the failure to consider fully the aspect of persecution by a non-State agent in which the State authorities at local level might, for Convention reasons, have been sufficiently legally implicated, a constructive failure of jurisdiction of a kind sufficient to invalidate the Tribunal's decision. Leave to raise new grounds 65 Thus, in my opinion, some of the new legal arguments have merit and some have not. They involve legal questions only and there is no possibility that they might have been countered in the Federal Magistrates Court by the calling of evidence by the respondents. There is no acceptable explanation of why they were not raised below except that these cases are difficult and it is not uncommon for different minds to perceive different legal problems and arguments. There has been little dislocation to judicial sitting time though some in relation to judgment-writing time. The case raises no new legal issues of wider importance. 66 The appellant has, it has been twice found by the Tribunal, suffered grievously. Should she be wrongly returned to Indonesia to face the risk of further persecution, it would be a bad affair. There is no clear pattern of acceptance by successive Ministers of humanitarian concerns expressed by judges in reconsideration under s 417 of the cases of persons whose applications have been rejected by the Tribunal and who have been shown to have no available curial remedy. I am not, of course, critical of the relevant Ministers in that regard. Nevertheless, I cannot assume that there is likely to be any acceptance of obvious humanitarian concerns for the appellant, if she is not permitted to rely on those of her intended new grounds that have merit. In short, much is at stake for her. 67 Apart from questions of costs, which can be adjusted (and I have no reason to think appropriate orders would be simply hollow), there is no actual prejudice to the Minister, except a degree of disruption to orderly administration. That degree is not, however, great. 68 It does concern me that the appeal to the Federal Magistrates Court might as well have not occurred. The time and energy of a busy member of that court was wasted. It is inescapable that the integrity of the proper curial processes is, to an extent, dealt a blow if the appeal to this Court is upheld on grounds that could have been argued below. 69 Nevertheless, I think that, on terms as to costs, in the interests of justice leave to raise the new grounds should be granted. The general desirability that an applicant for refugee status should have her case determined according to law has added force here, on account of what the Tribunal found she has suffered. Disposition 1. Leave will be granted to amend the Notice of Appeal to rely on the grounds discussed at paragraphs 29-64 of these reasons and the Notice of Appeal will be deemed to stand to amended. 2. The orders of the Federal Magistrates Court except as to costs will be set aside. 3. The decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal will be quashed. 4. The Tribunal will be ordered to reconsider the appellant's application according to law. 5. The first respondent will be ordered to pay only $3,000 by way of the costs of the proceedings in this Court (such sum being a figure commonly allowed as the costs of an application to the Federal Magistrates Court).

Associate: Dated: 3 February 2006 Counsel for the Appellant: Ms A Seward Solicitor for the Appellant: Mr R Turner Counsel for the Respondents: Mr G Kennett Mr J Smith Solicitor for the Respondents: Clayton Utz Date of Hearing: 9 June 2005 Date of Judgment: 3 February 2006 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/3.html","title":"06_3.txt","id":"37"},{"snippet":"On 3 December 2009 I dismissed an application to set aside Bankruptcy Notice NN2140/2009 ('Bankruptcy Notice') issued by the Official Receiver on 26 May 2009, and served on the applicant debtor ('Mr O'Meara') on 5 August 2009. What follows are my reasons for doing so. The Bankruptcy Notice claims that Mr O'Meara owes the respondent creditor ('the Commissioner') costs in proceeding No. NSD 1000 of 2002 assessed at $19,953.00, together with $5,659.55 interest. By entry stamped 30.8.06, the Court, pursuant to O 62 r 54(3) of the Federal Court of Australia Rules , ordered Mr O'Meara pay the sum of $19,953.00 to the Commissioner. The application, which was filed on 21 August 2009, sought, inter alia, orders that the Bankruptcy Notice be 'dismissed' which, having regard to the header of the application, I read and construe as 'set aside'. On the hearing of the application, Mr O'Meara did not suggest otherwise. Other relief was sought including an order that time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice be extended until the application is heard and finally determined. There has been no actual extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice, however, if the provisions of s 41(7) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) are engaged, time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice will be deemed to have been extended until and including the day referred to therein. Section 41(7) provides: Where, before the expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the requirements of a bankruptcy notice, the debtor has applied to the Court for an order setting aside the bankruptcy notice on the ground that the debtor has such a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand as is referred to in paragraph 40(1)(g), and the Court has not, before the expiration of that time, determined whether it is satisfied that the debtor has such a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand, that time shall be deemed to have been extended, immediately before its expiration, until and including the day on which the Court determines whether it is so satisfied. The grounds of the application are far from clear, however, from the terms of the application and affidavits sworn by Mr O'Meara and subsequently filed in Court, it seems that Mr O'Meara claims that the Commissioner owes him an amount of 'about 70 million dollars plus interest' in consequence of the issue of alleged 'covert credit assessments'. Apparently, the application was not served on the Commissioner and certainly no affidavit was filed with or accompanied the application. On 9 September 2009 the application was listed before a Registrar of the Court. On that occasion, Mr O'Meara filed in Court two affidavits sworn by him, the first on 7 August 2009 and the second on 18 August 2009. On 10 September 2009 Mr O'Meara filed a further affidavit sworn by him on 3 September 2009. Rule 3.02 of the Federal Court (Bankruptcy) Rules 2005 mandates what is required for an application to set aside a bankruptcy notice. It provides: (1) An application to set aside a bankruptcy notice must be accompanied by: (a) a copy of the bankruptcy notice; and (b) an affidavit stating: (i) the grounds in support of the application; and (ii) the date when the bankruptcy notice was served on the applicant; and (c) a copy of any application to set aside the judgment or order in relation to which the bankruptcy notice was issued and any material in support of that application. (2) If the application is based on the ground that the debtor has a counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand mentioned in paragraph 40(1)(g) of the Bankruptcy Act , the affidavit must also state: (a) the full details of the counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand; and (b) the amount of the counterclaim, set-off or cross demand and the amount by which it exceeds the amount claimed in the bankruptcy notice; and (c) why the counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand was not raised in the proceeding that resulted in the judgment or order in relation to which the bankruptcy notice was issued. (3) The application and supporting documents must be served on the respondent creditor within 3 days after the application is filed. Sub-rule 3.02(2) is specifically directed to applications to set aside of the kind referred to in s 41(7) of the Act. Although the application was filed before the expiration of the time fixed for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice, no affidavit satisfying the requirements of either para (b) of sub-rule 3.02(1) or sub-rule 3.02(2) was filed by Mr O'Meara before the expiration of that time. It follows that whether Mr O'Meara relies on para 40(1)(g) (when sub-rule 3.02(2) would be relevant) or some other ground (when para (b) of sub-rule 3.01 would be relevant) to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice, his application is not competent. It is as if no application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice was ever filed. Moreover, because the deemed extension of time under s 41(7) is not triggered and in the absence of an actual extension of time for compliance with the Bankruptcy Notice, Mr O'Meara committed an act of bankruptcy on the expiration of the time prescribed in the Bankruptcy Notice for compliance with its requirements. Even if Mr O'Meara's application to set aside the Bankruptcy Notice was competent and I could rely on all the evidence contained in his affidavits sworn 7 August, 18 August and 3 September 2009, I would nevertheless dismiss the application. First, I am not satisfied that Mr O'Meara has a counter-claim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of $19,953.00, being the amount the subject of this Court's order entered on 30 August 2009. Second, Mr O'Meara does not contend that the issue and service of the Bankruptcy Notice is an abuse of process. Third, neither the form or content of the Bankruptcy Notice, its service on Mr O'Meara, nor the existence of the debt upon which the Court's order and, in turn, the Bankruptcy Notice is founded, are put in issue by Mr O'Meara. As was said by Emmett J in Australian Securities Investment Commissioner v Forge [2003] FCAFC 274 ; (2003) 133 FCR 487 at [27] : [T]he Act gives no general discretion to set aside bankruptcy notices that are valid in form and not an abuse of process. The Act permits the issue of a bankruptcy notice and, if the notice is valid, prescribes the consequences to the bankrupt of non-compliance. The grounds upon which a bankruptcy notice may be set aside must relate to the form or content of the notice, service of the notice or the existence of the debt upon which the judgment, and, in turn, the notice, is founded. Reference to the existence of a debt includes the existence of a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand equal to or exceeding the amount of the debt: Re Briggs; Ex parte Briggs v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (WA) (1986) 12 FCR 310 ; Re Athans; Ex parte Athans (1991) 29 FCR 302. Since jurisdiction to set aside a defective bankruptcy notice is not a general discretionary jurisdiction, it differs from the jurisdiction to make a sequestration order under s 52(1), which is expressly discretionary. The application must be dismissed with costs. Because I believe the leave of the Court will be required if Mr O'Meara wants to pursue an appeal, having regard to the time of the year, I will order an extension of time, within which a notice of motion seeking that leave may be filed. I certify that the preceding twelve (12) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds. Associate: Dated: 22 December 2009 Counsel for the Applicant: The applicant appeared in person Counsel for the Respondent: Ms E Glover Solicitor for the Respondent: ATO Legal Services Branch Date of Hearing: 3 December 2009 Date of Judgment: 22 December 2009 AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1575.html","title":"09_1575.txt","id":"38"},{"snippet":"1 This is an application for interlocutory relief in the form of a mandatory injunction. It arises in the following circumstances. The applicant has filed an application containing a claim pursuant to ss 52 , 75B , 80 , 82 and 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ('the Act') and for breach of contract relating to the purchase by the applicant from the first respondent (of which the second and third respondents were the sole directors) of the business of a child care centre in Karrinyup. The price of $276 153 was paid for goodwill. 2 The claim is for an order for transfer of the telephone number of the business to the applicant and damages for failure to transfer the telephone number at settlement and for loss of goodwill from solicitation pre and post settlement and for failing to deliver financial records relating to the accounts of past and current customers of the business. 3 The claim for interlocutory relief relates to the first principal claim, namely an order to occasion the telephone number of the business to be transferred to the applicant at no cost to it. This therefore is an application for interlocutory relief which, at least to the extent of the first claim in the application, would be decisive of it. 4 The circumstances asserted in the statement of claim are as follows. The child care business purchased by the applicant is conducted at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup. The business at that address was formally known as Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre. 5 The statement of claim asserts that around March 2005, the applicant received a written sales brochure ('the Brochure') for the sale of the child care business from a business broker. The Brochure represented that the child care business had a weekly turnover of $7250, was strong and profitable in trading and had the potential to expand. Around 21 April 2005 the applicant and another company of which the second and third respondents were the only directors --- Patson Enterprises Pty Ltd, then mistakenly thought to be the company which owned the child care business --- entered into a written contract for sale of the business as a going concern ('the Original Contract'). Paragraphs nine to twelve of the statement of claim plead as follows: '9. The Original Contract contained the following material terms: (a) the gross purchase price was $337,000.00 of which $276,153 was payable for goodwill and the balance of equipment; (b) it was subject to: (i) the purchaser being satisfied as to the profitability of the business (ii) an increase being made to the child care fees being charged to be comparable with other centres within a 5 kilometre radius; (iii) the trading hours being shortened from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm Monday to Friday than 6:30 am and 6:30 pm. (c) that on settlement the First Respondent will deliver the financial records relating to the accounts of past and current customers of the business; (d) that the First Respondent would conduct the business as a going concern until settlement and conduct it efficiently, in a proper and businesslike manner, to the best of its skill and ability, in order to maintain goodwill and the profitability of the business and not terminate the employment of existing employees; (e) that the First Respondent would do all things necessary for effectively vesting the business in the purchaser; (f) that on settlement the First Respondent deliver any documents providing evidence of ownership of telephone numbers associated with the business and do all things necessary for effectively vesting in the purchaser the business including assistance in the transfer of the telephone number; (g) that the First Respondent would provide on settlement all records relating to enquiries or approaches made by prospective customers or clients and relating to concluded or pending negotiations for children for the centre so that the purchaser would receive on settlement the benefit of any pending enquiries; (h) that the First Respondent would not for a period of 5 years after settlement engage in conduct derogating from the purchaser's right to obtain the full benefit of the goodwill of the business; (i) the First Respondent would not from the date of the Original Agreement and for a period of 5 years after settlement disclose or use or attempt to use any confidential information regarding the business including confidential financial information and details of customers, past or current negotiations or transactions relating to customers or the business; (j) that the First Respondent would not for a period of 5 years after settlement solicit, canvass or endeavour to obtain the custom of customers of the business who had been customers or clients at any time during the period of 2 years immediately preceding the date of settlement nor to entice or attempt to entice any employee of the business from continuing to be employed in the business; (k) that on settlement the First Respondent would deliver a deed of restraint whereby both the Second and Third Respondents accepted the same restraints on competition as contained in clauses (h), (i) and (j) above. 10. On 25 May 2005 the Third Respondent on behalf of the First Respondent provided written financial information to the Applicant representing: (a) the income to 31 March 2005 was $300,092.00; (b) the annualised result was $400,122.66; (c) the figures do not include income for before and after school care which the Child Care Business could also provide and that extra service will generate approximately an extra $100,000.00 per annum; (d) the forecast turnover for the year is $440,000.00 plus after school care meaning $440,000.00 plus before and after school care income; (e) that fees had been increased about two weeks ago and are not reflected in the figures. 11. The representation pleaded in paragraph 10(c) as to an extra $100,000.00 per annum and 10(d) of forecast turnover of $440,000.00 were representations as to future matters for the purposes of section 51A of the Trade Practices Act . 12. In reliance on the representation pleaded in paragraph 10 the Applicant was satisfied as to the profitability of the business and on or about 2 August 2005 a substitute written agreement was entered into identical in all material respects to the Original Contract other than the identity of the vendor was clarified and substituted as being the First Respondent. ' 6 It is pleaded that settlement of the purchase of the business occurred on 26 August 2005 in reliance on certain pleaded representations concerning enrolments in it. 7 Around that date the applicant was unable to arrange the transfer of the telephone number of the business into the name of the applicant because it had been transferred by or on behalf of the first respondent to the Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street, Karrinyup being the other centre in Karrinyup associated with the second and third respondents. It is alleged that prior to settlement the first respondent had eroded the goodwill of the child care business by encouraging parents to move their children to the Karrinyup Child Care Centre. 8 After pleading the allegations of engagement by the first respondent in conduct that was misleading or deceptive it is also pleaded that damages are sought from the first respondent for breach of contract for not assisting in transfer of the telephone number and in not maintaining the goodwill and profitability of the business to settlement and in derogating after settlement from the purchaser's right to obtain the full benefit of the goodwill of the business. There are other claims for breaches of contract not presently relevant. 9 The applicant's interlocutory application is supported by affidavits of Ms Ana Lara Skinner, a director of the applicant and the child care director and principal child carer for its business known as Tiny Beez Child Care (formerly Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre) which trades from the premises at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup. The affidavits were sworn on 23 December 2005 and 16 January 2006 respectively. The applicant has also given an undertaking as to damages. 10 The respondents bring evidence from Ms Lina Louise Dornford in an affidavit sworn on 12 January 2006 and Mr Gerard Cyril Herbert Dornford in an affidavit sworn the same date. They are each directors of the first respondent. 11 The first affidavit of Ms Skinner brings into evidence a copy of the agreement for the sale of the business. Clauses 3 and 4 of that agreement read: ' 3. SETTLEMENT AND POSSESSION The balance of Purchase Price shall be paid on the Date of Settlement specified in C of the Schedule and payment shall be effected by Bank Cheque(s) payable to the Vendor or the Vendor's Conveyancer or such other person or persons as the Vendor or the Vendor's Conveyancer shall nominate in writing. The Vendor shall deliver to the Purchaser a proper registrable and executed transfer of the Business Name in favour of the Purchaser. Possession of the Business shall be given on the Date of Possession provided Settlement and the counting of the stock has occurred. 4 VENDOR TO PROVIDE AT SETTLEMENT On Settlement the Vendor will deliver to the Purchaser, in addition to any other documents or records expressly agreed in this Agreement: (a) the documents and certificates establishing or providing evidence of title and ownership to the Business and to each asset included in the sale including but not limited to any intellectual property, rights to design and transfer of domain names, email addresses, telephone and fax numbers associated with the Business; (b) all licences, authorities and permits held by the Vendor in respect of the Business, except those which are expressly excluded from the sale; (c) such assignments or transfers of each business asset included in the sale as the Purchaser reasonably requires; (d) duly signed by the Vendor, the required form to notify the change of ownership of the Vendor's registered business name; (e) discharges or releases of mortgages, charges or encumbrances or of outstanding interest over any asset included in the sale; (f) keys to the Premises and passwords and/or code numbers for security devices to the Premises; (g) all lists and records relating to the customers of the Business; (h) the financial records relating to the accounts of past and current customers of the Business; (i) all orders, correspondence and records relating to inquiries or approaches made to the Vendor by prospective customers or clients and relating to concluded or pending negotiations for orders, so that the Purchaser will receive on Settlement the benefit of unfulfilled orders and pending negotiations for orders of the Business; (j) all computer software and systems necessary to continue on the Business, including any necessary assignments or new licences' Clause 12 reads: ' 12. FURTHER ASSURANCE Subject to the due and punctual performance by the Purchaser of all of the Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement the Vendor shall do all things necessary for effectively vesting in the Purchaser the Business and ensuring that all necessary licenses and/or franchises (if any) in respect of the Premises and Business are granted or assigned to the Purchaser. ' Clause 32 provided that the agreement would be subject to the laws of Western Australia. 12 In her first affidavit, Ms Skinner deposes that there have been persistent refusals by the respondents to transfer the telephone number to the applicant with the result that she arranged an alternative telephone number. Her evidence was that in the short term this caused concern among the parents and until she changed her advertising she was in fact advertising the telephone number of a competing Karrinyup Child Care Centre. Additionally she had prepared signage prior to the settlement date which advertised the new trading name but contained the telephone number, being the number in dispute, namely 9224 1905. When the respondents refused to transfer the telephone number she incurred expense in changing the signage. 13 In her first affidavit, Ms Skinner also deposes that the telephone number in question is the subject of a listing in the Yellow Pages. In the 2005 Yellow Pages the number appeared as part of listings for Tommie Turtle Child Care Centres in Belmont, Karrinyup and Huntingdale. It appeared as relating to the premises in Norman Street. In the 2006 Yellow Pages it appeared as one of two numbers relating to the competing Karrinyup centre in Davenport Street. Her evidence was that any telephone enquiries to the number in question were being received by the competing business associated with the second and third respondents. This is in the context where the applicant has paid a substantial sum for the goodwill of the business at the Norman Street premises. 14 In her second affidavit, Ms Skinner deposes that an internet online search of the Yellow Pages for child care centres in Karrinyup shows the telephone number 9244 1905 as associated with the business at Norman Street. In fact that number would be answered by the competing business of the respondents at 22 Davenport Street. In contrast the 2006 Yellow Pages advertisement shows, as has been said, the two telephone numbers including the number in dispute. Anyone using those references and phoning 9244 1905, would not have the availability of the current phone number of the Norman Street business. 15 Ms Skinner further deposes that on taking possession of the business and having been advised by Telstra that the business telephone number had been transferred to Karrinyup Child Care Centre, they tried to arrange transfer of the number from the vendor. In the meantime she arranged a substitute business telephone number for the Norman Street business. It was then too late to advertise in the Yellow Pages. Her evidence is that the Norman Street business has the capacity to take further enrolments and that not having the telephone number previously associated with the business is critical to it, particularly at this time. She testifies that many parents are most active in seeking child care over the period from now until about mid to late February as this is the most active enrolment period for the forthcoming school year. She further deposes that some prospective parents seeking child care would still use the 9244 1905 number in an effort to contact the Norman Street business. This is because it is currently advertised in Yellow Pages online for that address. Also, there may be parents who wish to re-enrol students and who will have previous records of the address of the business. Additionally, she had distributed business cards prior to settlement on which the number in dispute had been advertised. She further states that in her experience parents looking for child care centres view the Yellow Pages and focus on a suburb. The consequence of the present modes of listing in the Yellow Pages is that the applicant has been deprived of telephone enquiries. 16 As to the steps taken by the applicant to obtain the telephone number, the evidence of Ms Skinner is that an email was sent on 29 August 2005 to the respondents' settlement agents. A further complaint was lodged by letter dated 1 September 2005. Correspondence then continued between solicitors. Following a letter of 25 October 2005 from the solicitors for the respondents to the solicitors for the applicant it became apparent that the possibility of a negotiated settlement and transfer of the telephone number in question was 'exhausted'. The applicant then had to consider the step of initiating proceedings which was not a step it took likely. During November 2005 Ms Skinner and her husband 'mulled over the matter'. Ms Skinner had further discussions with the solicitors for the applicant and in early December 2005 gave instructions for an opinion to be sought with regard to the initiation of proceedings in relation to the purchase, for damages and for the transfer of the telephone number. It was on 14 December 2005 that counsel was briefed and proceedings were filed on 23 December 2005 resulting in the interlocutory hearing on 13 January 2006. 17 The affidavit of Ms Dornford for the respondents is as follows. She deposes that the billing address had been changed and the telephone number in issue transferred prior to settlement of the sale of the business at Norman Street. On the second occasion in which she had met Ms Skinner, Ms Skinner had confirmed that she did not wish to use the business name 'Tommie Turtle' and wished to trade under the name of 'Tiny Beez'. 18 On or about 25 July 2005, Ms Dornford received a letter together with her co-director addressed to the 'Tommie Turtle Child Care Centre' from Sensis Pty Ltd in respect of the Yellow Pages advertising program and inviting them to check the particulars of their advertising. She deposed that as the representative of the applicant had advised there was no requirement for the 'Tommie Turtle' name she requested Sensis Pty Ltd to remove the Norman Street address from the 'Tommie Turtle' Yellow Pages advertisement. This was at a time when all of the special conditions of the contract had not been satisfied and it was by no means certain that the applicant would proceed with the sale. The deadline for placing advertisements with the 2006 Yellow Pages was around 22 July 2005. 19 Approximately two weeks prior to settlement in a telephone conversation with Ms Skinner, Ms Dornford advised her that the first and second respondents would be taking the telephone number 9244 1905 to the premises of Karrinyup Child Care Centre at 22 Davenport Street. Ms Skinner replied that could not be done because she had ordered signage and stationary bearing the name Tiny Beez with that telephone number. Ms Dornford advised her that she had already arranged for the Yellow Pages advertising and it was too late to change it. Ms Skinner did not say anything more about it until after settlement. In particular, no request was made by or on behalf of the applicant for the transfer of the telephone number prior to settlement. 20 Prior to settlement, Ms Dornford diverted the line, 9244 1905, back to a second line at Norman Street until the date of settlement. That second line was cancelled by her on 29 August 2005. The applicant wished to reconnect the second line and that occurred on 30 August 2005. 21 Ms Dornford's evidence is that she only became aware of the objection to the retention of the telephone number, 9244 1905, in the conversation referred to above that occurred two weeks prior to settlement. Even then the applicant had not requested the transfer of the telephone number to it and had proceeded to settlement knowing that the respondents intended to take the telephone number with them. 22 So far as the applicant seeks to attribute reduction in turnover to the transfer of the telephone number in question to the respondents, Ms Dornford says that many of the actions and policies of the applicant could have contributed to the alleged loss. 23 Her further evidence was that if the respondents are ordered to transfer the telephone number now, any customers referring to the 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact 'Tommie Turtle' will be put through to 'Tiny Beez'. 24 Mr Dornford's affidavit is generally supportive of the evidence of Ms Dornford. In addition he deposes that he has been told by advisors and it is his experience in business generally, that it is the responsibility of a purchaser (here the applicant) to make applications for the transfer of a business telephone number because Telstra could then make any necessary credit arrangements. No such application had been made to Telstra by the applicant prior to settlement. WHETHER SERIOUS QUESTION TO BE TRIED 25 The nub of the applicant's claim with respect to the transfer of the telephone number, 9244 1905, is that there is a breach of contract in it not having originally been transferred to it. This directs attention to the provisions in the sale agreement, the relevant portions having been set out above. 26 It is apparent that the applicant as purchaser waived the right to the transfer of the business name provided for in cl 3. 27 The relevant provision with respect to the telephone number is that appearing in cl 4(a). The question raised by the terms of the clause is whether in fact the telephone number in question was 'an asset of the Business'. Part A of the sale agreement describes the business as the goodwill of the child care centre business carried on at 21 Norman Street, Karrinyup under the name of Tommie Turtle Karrinyup Child Care Centre. That latter name is identified as 'the Business Name'. It is clear that the business name was not an asset to be transferred at settlement. 28 The prima face position raised by cl 4(a) is, in my opinion, that there is an obligation on the respondents as vendors to deliver to the applicant as purchaser the documents and certificates establishing or providing evidence of title and ownership to the asset comprised by the telephone number being the number associated with the business. 29 The respondents state however that such cannot be the case where prior to settlement the applicant has been advised that the telephone number will not be transferred and has made no demur. The respondents have not contended that amounted to a waiver but it nevertheless relies on the evidence of non-response from Ms Skinner on behalf of the applicant to the advice that the telephone number was not included in the sale. 30 Further, there is some issue, not yet viewed with complete clarity, as to whether the respondents are disputing that any consideration passed for the telephone number in terms of the goodwill. Certainly the respondents contend that the mere reference to the amount of money paid for goodwill does not itself establish that the particular telephone number was included in the sale. 31 In my view there is a serious issue to be tried on the question of whether there was a breach of contract in the circumstances. On the face of it the contractual provisions give rise to a right, however, the full effect of the evidence on which the respondents rely cannot be determined until trial. BALANCE OF CONVENIENCE 32 The respondents contend that the applicant has not shown to the requisite standard that on the balance of convenience it should be granted an injunction. It relies on a number of factors which are generally finely balanced. 33 First is the delay between the date of settlement and the application to the Court for interlocutory relief. The second affidavit of Ms Skinner makes apparent that the delay is not entirely explained by the time taken for exchange of correspondence between solicitors and others. Rather, there was at least a month when those involved in the applicant 'mulled over the matter'. The reality is that the business purchased by the applicant has been able to be contacted under the second line installed by the respondents prior to settlement and taken over after settlement by the applicant. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the business purchased by them is not yet fully enrolled and that this is an important time of the year for maximum access in terms of attracting enrolments. Further, the respondents make the point that as there never was any indication from them that they were willing to transfer the telephone number the delay in issuing proceedings for an injunction is not adequately explained. Further, the respondents contend that the applicant has failed to show why the transfer of the telephone number after a period of almost five months would benefit it to a degree that would outweigh the hardship to the respondents given that it was Ms Skinner for the applicant who had advised she did not wish to use the 'Tommie Turtle' name and that number has been associated with the 'Tommie Turtle' name and now with the new premises by customers. 34 Further, it is contended that the applicant has failed to show that the transfer of the telephone number would enhance the goodwill of the business to a significant degree compared to other advertising such as signs on site, newspaper advertising, electronic Yellow Pages or direct mail outs that would cause no hardship or inconvenience to the respondents. 35 Further, it is contended for the respondents that if the Court takes the view that the applicant is entitled to the telephone number in question, transferring the telephone number after such a delay when a contrary advertisement has been placed at this stage is not the appropriate remedy. 36 Therefore, it is said that the applicant must prove on the balance of probabilities that not only is it entitled to the number pursuant to the sale agreement but that it has suffered at least some damage as a result of the transfer of the telephone number to new premises in circumstances where it is not sought to retain the former business name and that there is a benefit it would obtain if the telephone number was transferred back to it after a lapse of some months which would outweigh the hardship to the respondents. The respondents submit that the applicant has not proved this to the required standards. Therefore it is said this is a case where an injunction is not an appropriate remedy, and by implication damages could be. 37 For the applicant reliance is placed on the statement in RP Meagher, Meagher, Gummow and Lehane's Equity: Doctrines and Remedies 4 th edn Butterworths 2002 at [21-380] where it is stated: 'The greater the hardship to the defendant, the greater the reluctance of the Court to grant the injunction; but, the more it is apparent that an equal or further hardship would be caused to the plaintiff by refusing an injunction, or the stronger a plaintiff's case appears, the more that reluctance will be dissipated: Beese v Woodhouse [1970] 1 All ER 769; [1971] WLR 586. ' 38 The applicant submits that the only stated concern of the respondents is that any customers referring to the printed 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact Tommie Turtle at Davenport Street will be put through to Tiny Beez being the Norman Street business. However that is in circumstances where the online Yellow Pages displays the Norman Street address with the 9244 1905 telephone number. 39 Additionally the Davenport Street business has an alternative telephone number displayed in the printed 2006 Yellow Pages. 40 In contrast any customers referring to telephone records other than the printed 2006 Yellow Pages seeking to contact the child care business at Norman Street would get the competing business of the respondents at Davenport Street without an alternative telephone number. This could include people using the current Yellow Pages on-line, past customers using business cards and their own records of telephone numbers, persons using printed Yellow Pages from 2005 and earlier or old stationary, old notations and telephone numbers given on a referral basis. 41 The applicant submits that given the strong merits of the case for breach of contract in favour of the applicant, the risk of any confusion generated by the deliberate act of the respondents in advertising the Norman Street telephone number should be borne by the respondents given the difficulty of the applicant in assessing damages. Had the respondents retained the Norman Street address when they received the letter from Sensis Pty Ltd dated 25 July 2005, there would have been no confusion. Therefore, any confusion has been created by the deliberate breach of contract of the respondents. They, therefore, should bear the risk of any confusion. 42 The applicant also contends that the conduct by the respondents in approving the printed 2006 Yellow Pages listing at that time was done in breach of cl 13 of the general conditions of the agreement for sale which provided that the vendor was to conduct the business as a going concern until settlement in order to maintain goodwill and profitability. Relevantly that portion of the agreement reads: ' 13. CONDUCT BEFORE SETTLEMENT The Vendor agrees to conduct the Business as a going concern at the Premises until Settlement and: (a) to conduct the Business efficiently, in a proper and businesslike manner, to the best of the Vendor's skill and ability, in order to maintain goodwill and the profitability of the Business such conduct to include promotional and marketing activities normal for the current trading period. In the event such promotional, marketing or advertising activity entails or requires forward planning, bookings for advertisement placements, brochures, catalogues and the like, then the Vendor will assist the Purchaser with such planning and the Vendor will be liable only for such portion of the costs that are relevant to the remainder of the Vendor's trading time in the Business; ...' 43 Therefore the applicant submits that the other way to contrast the situation is if the printed Yellow Pages advertisement for 2006 had stayed the same as for 2005 as it did for the online Yellow Pages then anyone ringing the 9244 1905 telephone number would have known it was for the business at Norman Street and that it was still a child care centre business notwithstanding the ownership had changed and so had the business name. 44 I find these factors flowing from the submissions of both parties in relation to the balance of convenience fairly evenly balanced themselves. The thing that ultimately persuades me that the applicant should succeed is the submission relating to the strength of the case for contractual breach. If the respondents had any case to argue in terms of legal categories arising from the advice to the applicant that the telephone number was not being transferred and the progression of settlement in the face of that knowledge, they have not made them apparent at the stage of this interlocutory application. Consequently the prima facie position remains that the contract has been breached. The strength of that position is entitled to resonate in the balance of convenience. I therefore do not agree with the respondents that this is a case where the balance of convenience should nevertheless be allowed to tip in the respondents favour. This is because ultimately if interlocutory relief were not granted and the matter was determined adversely to the respondents at trial, as it will appear to be likely on the issue of contractual breach so far as it can be judged at this stage, the case for not granting any relief would have then been considerably escalated because of the reasonably longer time lapse involved to enable the resolution of the dispute at trial. 45 For these reasons I consider that the balance of convenience does tip in favour of the applicant. Consequently the interlocutory relief should issue. I certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Nicholson.

The subpoena is dated 18 September 2008 and calls upon KPMG to produce: \"Documents (including without limitation correspondence, electronic mail, spreadsheets, memoranda, working papers and file notes) relating to any report, audit, assessment or review prepared by KPMG for or at the request of Multiplex Limited, Multiplex Constructions Pty Ltd, Multiplex Constructions (UK) Ltd and Multiplex Funds Management Ltd (collectively \"Multiplex\") during the period 1 January 2004 to 30 September 2005 relating to: (a) Wembley National Stadium; (b) West India Quay (UK) project; (c) a transaction between Multiplex and MCB (Gibraltar) Ltd in relation to a development project in Gibraltar; and (d) the acquisition of Duelguide PLC. \" On 5 November 2008 Registrar Moore made orders in relation to the return of the subpoena as follows: \"1. The subpoena addressed to KPMG be returnable on 12 November 2008 at 2.15 p.m. and that KPMG be directed to produce the documents withheld by KPMG pursuant to section 1317AE(i) of the Corporations Act at that time. If KPMG wishes to claim privilege over any such document, KPMG must notify the Applicant and the Court by 12 November 2008 at 2.15 p.m. Leave be granted to the First and Second Respondents to have first right of access to uplift, inspect and copy the documents produced pursuant to this order by KPMG to the court on 12 November 2008. If any Respondent wishes to claim privilege over any document, the Respondent must notify the Applicant and the Court by 4.00 p.m., 19 November 2008. Following access being granted to the First and Second Respondents, leave be granted to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (\"ASIC\") to have right of access to uplift, inspect and copy those documents produced pursuant to these orders over which the First and Second Respondents have not claimed privilege for the purpose of determining whether any public interest immunity claim arises. If ASIC wishes to claim public interest immunity over any document, ASIC must notify the Applicant and the Court by 4.00 p.m., 27 November 2008. If no claim of privilege or public interest immunity is made, the Applicant is granted leave to uplift, inspect and copy the documents produced pursuant to this order from 28 November 2008. ...\" On 27 November 2008 Registrar Moore varied his earlier order so as to provide that if ASIC wished to claim public interest immunity over any document it should notify the applicants and the Court by 4 December 2008. On 21 April 2009 Registrar Hetyey made orders, inter alia, granting leave to ASIC to inspect the documents produced under the subpoena save for any documents over which the first and second respondents (\"the Multiplex parties\") had claimed privilege for the purpose of determining whether any public interest immunity claim arose. He further ordered that if ASIC wished to claim public interest immunity over any of the documents it was to file and serve an affidavit in support setting forth the grounds of public interest immunity and the facts relied upon. On 25 June 2009 Registrar Moore ordered that the order made on 21 April 2009 requiring ASIC to file and serve an affidavit setting out the basis of any claim for public interest immunity to be stayed until fourteen days after the handing down of my judgment in relation to ASIC's claim for public interest immunity in relation to documents produced by it in respect of which the applicants had sought inspection. On 30 June 2009 I ordered that, inter alia, the applicants have leave to have any application pursuant to s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) for a review of the decision made by Registrar Moore on 25 June 2009 returnable before me on 6 July 2009. On 30 June 2009 the applicants asked me to determine any claim by ASIC for public interest immunity in respect of the documents produced by KPMG under the subpoena addressed to it at the same time as I determined the claim in respect of the documents produced by ASIC. On 1 July 2009 the applicants filed a notice of motion pursuant to s 35A(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) seeking a review of the orders made by Registrar Moore on 25 June 2009. That notice of motion sought orders that ASIC file and serve affidavits in support of its claim for public interest immunity over any of the documents produced by KPMG pursuant to the subpoena served on it. The parties proceeded on the basis that the issue of the production of the documents produced by KPMG was adjourned to the hearing on 6 July 2009. On 6 July 2009 Senior Counsel for ASIC informed me that there were of the order of 110 documents produced by KPMG which needed to be examined by ASIC to determine whether it wished to make a claim for public interest immunity in respect of any of them. On 18 August 2009, in response to the subpoena, KPMG produced to the Court an additional nine folders of documents and a set of five audiotapes. On 16 September 2009 I gave ASIC leave to inspect these documents and audiotapes and to copy the documents, other than the documents over which the second or third respondents had claimed legal professional privilege, in order to determine whether ASIC wished to maintain a claim of public interest immunity in respect of any of the documents or audiotapes. ASIC reviewed the documents and returned to the Court. On 5 November 2009 I gave ASIC leave again to inspect the documents in order to determine whether any additional public interest immunity claims arose in respect of certain documents. ASIC filed the following affidavits on which it relied in support of its claim that a number of the documents and audio tapes produced by KPMG pursuant to the subpoena served on it should not be disclosed and should be protected from disclosure on the ground of public interest immunity: 1. Affidavit of Abigail Sheppard affirmed 12 June 2009 (\"the Sheppard affidavit\") 2. Affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 12 June 2009 3. Confidential affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 12 June 2009 4. Affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 14 August 2009 5. Confidential affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 17 August 2009 6. Affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 4 September 2009 7. Affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 15 September 2009 8. Confidential affidavit of Louise Macaulay affirmed 11 November 2009. For the sake of convenience, the KPMG documents which ASIC has inspected have been divided by ASIC into four tranches. Each tranche has been separately numbered sequentially. In respect of the first tranche documents: (a) ASIC does not object to inspection by the applicants of the documents numbered 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 13; (b) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over part of the documents, being documents numbered 3, 7, 9, 11, 12 and 14. In respect of the second tranche documents: (a) ASIC does not object to inspection by the applicants of the documents numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 26, 28, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45, 50, 52, 54, 55, 58, 60, 62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 69, 72, 75 over which documents ASIC previously made a claim based on the confidentiality of Mr Stuart Cummins' identity as an informer; (b) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over the whole of the documents numbered 25 and 49; (c) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over parts of the documents numbered 6, 8, 17, 21, 22, 23, 24, 27, 29, 32, 33, 37, 38, 40, 44, 46, 47, 48, 51, 53, 56, 57, 61, 67, 70, 71, 73, 74 and 76. In respect of the third tranche documents: (a) ASIC does not object to inspection by the applicants of the documents numbered 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 as set out in \" Exhibit ARAS-10 \" over which documents ASIC previously made a claim based on the confidentiality of Mr Stuart Cummins' identity as an informer; (b) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over the whole of the documents numbered 10 and 11 as set out in \" Exhibit ARAS-10 \"; (c) ASIC maintains its claim for public interest immunity over part of the documents numbered 3, 4, 16, 19 and 22 as set out in \" Exhibit ARAS-10 \". In respect of the fourth tranche documents ASIC said: (a) ASIC makes a claim of public interest immunity over parts of 35 of the documents, numbered 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43; (b) ASIC makes a claim of public interest immunity over the whole of the documents numbered 1, 4, 5, 11, 20, 21, 30, 32, 44 and 45; (c) the audiotapes appear to record interviews conducted by KPMG officers of various officers of the second respondent. ASIC makes no claim of public interest immunity in respect of tape number 1. Tapes numbered 2, 4 and 5 appear to record an interview with Mr Noel Anderson and tape 3 appears to record an interview with Mr Andrew Roberts. Transcripts of these interviews have been produced and are documents numbered 6 and 21 in the second tranche documents. ASIC has maintained a claim for public interest immunity over parts of those documents. ASIC says that because of the difficulty in redacting parts of an audiotape it is not practical to make any part of the tapes numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5 available to the applicants. ASIC contends that the transcript of the interviews set out substantially what is recorded on these tapes although in the case of the interview with Mr Noel Anderson the transcript contains a part of the interview which does not appear to be included in the tapes. On 23 July 2009 I published reasons for judgment in relation to ASIC's claim for public interest immunity in relation to the documents produced by it in respect of which the applicants had sought inspection. On 29 July 2009 I ordered that ASIC produce to the Court specified documents or copies thereof redacted and masked in accordance with Confidential Appendix A to that order. In the reasons for judgment published on 23 July 2009 I set out and explained the process of analysis and consideration which I had undertaken in determining ASIC's challenge to the application for production and inspection of documents produced under subpoena by it on the ground of public interest immunity because the documents might tend to disclose the identity of an informer or informers. In considering ASIC's claim for public interest immunity in respect of the documents produced by KPMG I have adopted the same process of analysis and consideration. Although I have adopted the same approach and undertaken the same process of reasoning in relation to the documents produced by KPMG as I undertook in relation to the documents produced by ASIC, I will repeat verbatim passages in the reasons for judgment of 23 July 2009 which are relevant to my consideration of the KPMG documents. The first step is to determine whether the documents produced by KPMG disclose the existence of an informer or informers to ASIC. The second step is to determine whether the documents tend to identify an informer or informers to ASIC. If they do, the second step also involves determining whether the documents can be redacted or masked in such a way that, in their masked form, it will not be possible, even by the conveying of \"a shrewd idea\", to identify the informer or informers. The third step is to undertake a balancing exercise and determine whether, in the circumstances of this case, the documents to the extent to which they are not redacted or masked are of sufficient importance for the applicants' conduct of the proceeding to outweigh the importance of not disclosing the identity of the informer or informers. I must take into account, follow and apply the relevant and binding reasoning and ratio of the Full Court in Australian Securities and Investments Commission v P Dawson Nominees Pty Ltd [2008] FCAFC 123 ; (2008) 169 FCR 227. I consider that I should apply the following principles and propositions contained in the reasoning of the Full Court whether they be the ratio, or one of the rationes, of the decision or persuasive and considered obiter dicta: (a) In determining a claim for protection of documents from disclosure and inspection on the ground of public interest immunity a Court must undertake a balancing exercise and determine whether the public interest in protecting from disclosure the identity of an informer outweighs the public interest that in a civil proceeding a party should not be denied access to relevant evidence; (b) The partial or limited disclosure of the identity of an informer is not conclusive in determining whether the identity of the informer should be protected from being disclosed in documents sought to be the subject of inspection on the ground of public interest immunity. Immunity from further disclosure is not necessarily lost where there has been a partial limited disclosure of the identity of an informer; (c) The transcripts of the examination of the informer or informers would, both directly and circumstantially, identify the informer or the informers; (d) The appropriate test to apply in determining whether inspection of the relevant documents and transcripts might disclose the identity of an informer or informers is to ask whether there is in the documents any material by which \"a shrewd idea\" might be conveyed as to the identity of the informer or informers, noting that documents taken together may convey information which each, by itself, could not convey. Further, the benefit of the doubt should be in favour of non-disclosure. The observations I made in pars [13]-[20] in my reasons for judgment published on 23 July 2009 apply in relation to ASIC's claim for public interest immunity in respect of the documents produced by KPMG. I have considered the submissions made by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents and audio tapes and the redaction or masking proposed by ASIC in relation to a number of those documents. I have reached the conclusion that the redaction and masking undertaken by ASIC in relation to the KPMG documents goes beyond the redaction and masking which is necessary in order to ensure that the documents do not have a tendency to disclose the identity of an informer or informers to ASIC. I set out in Confidential Appendix A to these reasons my conclusion whether ASIC's claims for public interest immunity in respect of the documents should be upheld or rejected and my conclusion as to the redaction and masking of the documents which I consider should be undertaken. This Appendix will only be made available to ASIC's legal advisors and the deponents of its affidavits for the purpose of determining the form of any public non-confidential order which I should make. I have listened to audiotapes numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5 and am satisfied that the transcripts of the interviews being documents numbered 6 and 21 in the second tranche of documents set out substantially what is recorded on these audiotapes subject to the following corrections to document number 21. Page and Section Transcript Correction to Transcript Page 1 Section 5 That has been moved to the break even situation now being reported That has been moved to the situation now being reported Page 1 Section 6 I don't believe the site team...project outcome. I don't believe that the site team concurred with that view and he referred in one of the attachments he issued last night that he had had site meetings and it had been reinforced by Martin Tidd and Martin Sheppard. Page 2 Section 1 And Stewart...Stewart wrote And Martin Sheppard had been there for about one and a half weeks so I am buggered if I can see how they could have had even understood the project let alone formed a view or concurred with what Stewart wrote. I think that he has taken a little licence there. Page 2 Section 2 How do you think he obtained his estimate of losses OK so the 85 was something that Steward requested of people on site? Page 2 Section 3 (4 th line) If you look at the original program they were working to on site If you look at the original program and not even the program they were working on on site Page 2 Section 3 (8 th line) The detailed programming which showed The detailed programming had been completed and was being enacted and that was what I have described recently to the guys on site which showed Page 2 Section 3 (10th line) Which was running late Which because of delays that we saw particularly of weather Page 2 Section 3 (last line) What he wrote down Wrote down in some sort of schedule which he attached to this letter of the 26 th Page 2 Section 5 His position was not reviewed by the project team and certainly not by me But it was not a position that was reviewed certainly by me Page 2 Section 7 (first line) Before the 26th Before the Page 2 Section 7 (4 th line) He said that he incensed He said that he was incensed Page 2 Section 7 (6 th line) And that it showed a zero outcome This phrase is not recorded on the tape. In these circumstances, having regard to the difficulty in redacting parts of an audiotape, I uphold the claim of public interest immunity in respect of those tapes. I will hear the parties as to the form of the order I should make as a consequence of these reasons. I certify that the preceding twenty-six (26) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Goldberg.

Wilson, from October 2007 to September 2008, engaged in conduct in trade or commerce that was misleading or deceptive or likely to mislead or deceive in contravention of section 52(1) of the Act by: (a) issuing monthly invoices (Invoices) to Customers: (i) on the dates listed in column I of the Schedule; (ii) for the amounts calculated by reference to the number of Contracted Calls; and (b) representing to each of the Customers that Wilson had made the Contracted Calls to that Customer's premises in a particular month, save for any Permitted Missed Calls; and (c) refraining from: (i) informing any of the Customers that it missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, when the Customers would reasonably have expected that, if Wilson had missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson would have disclosed that fact to them; and (ii) reducing the amount charged in the invoices or providing Customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to the missed calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; when in fact, during the relevant month: (d) Wilson missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; and (e) Wilson knew that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to make the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers. BY CONSENT, THE COURT ORDERS THAT: Injunctions Wilson, whether by itself, its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever in connection with the supply or possible supply of Patrol Services in trade or commerce in Western Australia, be restrained for a period of three years from the date of the Court's order from issuing invoices to any customer of its Patrol Services for an amount calculated by reference to a number of Calls that it had contracted to make, or had represented that it would make to the customers' premises, unless, during the period covered by the invoice: (a) Wilson has made the agreed or represented number of Calls; (b) Wilson has charged only for the number of Calls actually made, on a \"fee per call\" basis; or (c) if Wilson has missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson within 30 days after the date of the invoice: (i) discloses that fact, and the total number of missed Calls or the number of missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, to that customer; and (ii) pays to, or allows a credit or rebate to, that customer for each such missed Call pro rata to the monthly fee payable for the Calls that it had agreed to make, or had represented that it would make to the customer's premises. Other orders Wilson, at its own expense and within 14 days of the date of this order, cause a letter to be sent to the Customers, in the terms and form as set out in Annexure A, advising of the Court's judgment, including its findings and the remedy granted. Wilson, within 42 days of the date of this order, establish a compliance policy and associated complaints handling system, training and review system for its security business (including its Patrol Services business) in Western Australia in accordance with the program set out in Annexure B (Compliance Program). Wilson maintain and operate the Compliance Program for a period of three years from the date of this order. Wilson pay the Applicant's costs of and incidental to the proceeding, to be taxed if not agreed. ANNEXURE A Attention: [insert customer name] [insert customer address] [insert date] , 2009 Dear [insert name] , DISCLOSURE NOTICE - Federal Court Ordered Notice The Federal Court of Australia has recently made orders against Wilson Parking Australia 1992 Pty Ltd ( Wilson ) in relation to legal proceedings instituted by the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission ( ACCC ). The Court declared that Wilson breached sections 52 and 53 (aa) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( Act ). The Court found that, during the period October 2007 to June 2008, Wilson, in the provision of mobile security patrol services, made false and misleading representations to some customers by representing to those customers that Wilson had made the contracted number of security inspections ( Contracted Calls ) to their premises, when in fact, Wilson had not made all those Contracted Calls. The Court also declared that Wilson breached section 52 of the Act, in that, during the period October 2007 to September 2008, Wilson, in the provision of mobile security patrol services, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by issuing monthly invoices to some customers for Contracted Calls without: • informing those customers that Wilson had missed some Contracted Calls; and • reducing the amount charged in the invoices to allow for the missed Contracted Calls; or providing the customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to those missed Contracted Calls. Section 52 of the Act prohibits a corporation from engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct. Section 53(aa) of the Act prohibits a corporation from making false representations that services are of a particular standard, quality, value or grade. As part of the orders, the Court has issued injunctions restraining Wilson from engaging in similar conduct in the future, and has ordered that Wilson: • publish this notice; • implement a corporate Trade Practices Compliance Program; and • pay the ACCC's court costs. Since becoming aware that [insert customer name] has been overcharged as a result of missed calls, Wilson has sent [insert customer name] Adjustment Notes crediting you an amount equal to the number of contracted calls that [insert customer name] did not receive during the relevant period. Should you require any further information, please contact Wilson on [insert telephone number] . Yours sincerely, [insert name] [insert position] ANNEXURE B TRADE PRACTICES COMPLIANCE PROGRAM Wilson Parking Australia 1992 Pty Ltd ( Wilson ) will establish a Trade Practices Compliance Program ( Compliance Program ) for its security business in Western Australia ( Business ) that complies with each of the following requirements: 1 Appointments Within 21 days of the Court's Order, Wilson will appoint a Director or a Senior Manager, whose responsibilities are to include the development, implementation and maintenance of the Compliance Program, and who reports directly to the company Board or governing body ( Compliance Officer ). 2 Risk Assessment 2.1 Wilson will appoint a qualified, internal or external compliance professional with expertise in trade practices issues ( Compliance Advisor ) within three months of the Court's Order, for the purposes set out in paragraph 2.2. 2.2 Wilson will instruct the Compliance Advisor to conduct a Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) ( TPA ) risk assessment ( Risk Assessment ) in accordance with 2.2.

Wilson must ensure that the training is conducted by a suitably qualified compliance professional or legal practitioner with expertise in trade practices law. 5.3 Wilson will ensure that the Compliance Program includes a requirement that awareness of trade practices compliance issues forms part of the induction of all new employees whose duties could result in them being concerned with conduct that may contravene sections 52 and 53 of the TPA. 6 Reports to Senior Management 6.1 Wilson will ensure that the Compliance Officer reports to the Board and/or senior management meetings every six months on the continuing effectiveness of the Compliance Program. 7 Supply Compliance Program documents to ACCC 7.1 Wilson shall, at its own expense, within six months of the date of the Court's Order, cause to be produced and provided to the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) copies of each of the documents constituting the Compliance Program. 7.2 Wilson will implement promptly and with due diligence any recommendations the ACCC may make that are reasonably necessary to ensure that Wilson maintains and continues to implement the Compliance Program in accordance with the Court's Order. 8 Review 8.1 Wilson will, at its own expense, cause annual reviews of the Compliance Program ( Reviews ) to be carried out in accordance with each of the following requirements: (a) Scope of Reviews --- the Reviews should be broad and rigorous enough to provide Wilson and the ACCC with supportable verification that Wilson has in place a program that complies with each of the requirements detailed in paragraphs 1-7 above, and to provide the reports and opinions detailed at point 9 below. (b) Independence of Reviewer --- Wilson will ensure that the Reviews are carried out by a suitably qualified, independent compliance professional with expertise in trade practices law ( Reviewer ). The Reviewer will qualify as independent on the basis that he or she: (i) did not design or implement the Compliance Program; (ii) is not a present or past staff member or director of Wilson; (iii) has not acted and does not act for Wilson in any trade practices related matters; and (iv) has not and does not act for or consult to Wilson or provide other services on trade practices related matters other than Compliance Program reviewing; and has no significant shareholding or other interests in Wilson. (c) Evidence --- Wilson will use its best endeavours to ensure that the Reviews are conducted on the basis that the Reviewer has access to all relevant sources of information in Wilson's possession or control, including without limitation: (i) enquiries of any officers, employees, representatives, agents and stakeholders of Wilson; (ii) Wilson's records, including the its complaints register/reports and any documents relevant to Wilson's training or induction program; and (iii) documents created by Wilson's consultants and legal practitioners for use in Wilson's Compliance Program. (d) Wilson will ensure that the first Review is completed within one year and one month of the Court's Order, and that each subsequent Review is completed within one year thereafter for a period of three years. 9 Reporting 9.1 Wilson will use its best endeavours to ensure that the Reviewer sets out the findings of the Review in two separate reports ( Review Reports ) as outlined below. 9.2 Company Compliance Program Review Report (to be provided to Wilson) (a) Wilson's Company Compliance Program Review Report will provide particular and specific information regarding the performance of the Compliance Program including: (i) if, and to what extent, Wilson's Compliance Program includes all the elements detailed in paragraphs 1 --- 6 above; (ii) if, and to what extent, Wilson's Compliance Program adequately covers the parties and areas identified in the initial Risk Assessment; (iii) if, and to what extent, the trade practices training is effective; (iv) if, and to what extent, Wilson's complaints handling system is effective; and (v) recommendations for rectifying deficiencies identified by the Review, which the Reviewer thinks are reasonably necessary to ensure that Wilson maintains and continues to implement the Compliance Program in accordance with these requirements. 9.3 ACCC Compliance Program Review Report (to be provided to the ACCC) (a) The ACCC Compliance Program Review Report will supply particular and specific information regarding the scope of the Review and the effectiveness of the Compliance Program, including: (i) details of the evidence gathered and examined during the Review; (ii) the name and relevant experience of the person appointed as the company Compliance Officer; (iii) the Reviewer's opinion on whether Wilson has in place an effective Compliance Program that complies with the requirements detailed in paragraph 1 --- 6 above; (iv) actions recommended by the Reviewer to ensure the continuing effectiveness of the Wilson's Compliance Program; (iv) confirmation that any actual and potential inadequacies in Wilson's Compliance Program have been brought to the attention of the Compliance Officer and the governing body; (v) confirmation that the Reviewer has revisited any actual and potential inadequacies in Wilson's Compliance Program identified in the previous Company Compliance Program Review Report, and assessed how they have been addressed by Wilson; (vi) any reservations that the Reviewer might have about the reliability and completeness of the information to which the Reviewer had access in the conduct and reporting of the Review; and (vii) any comments or qualifications concerning the Review process that the Reviewer, in his or her professional opinion, considers necessary. 9.4 Wilson will ensure that the Review Reports are completed and provided to Wilson within two months of each Review. 9.5 Wilson will retain the Company Compliance Program Review Report. Wilson will cause the ACCC Compliance Program Review Report to be provided to the ACCC within 14 days of receiving it from the Reviewer. 10 Recommendations 10.1 Wilson will implement promptly and with due diligence any recommendations made by the Reviewer or required by the ACCC, which are reasonably necessary to ensure that Wilson maintains and continues to implement the Compliance Program in accordance with the requirements of this Order. 10.2 Wilson shall, at its own expense, if requested by the ACCC, provide copies of documents and information in respect of matters which are the subject of the Compliance Program. 10.3 In the event the ACCC has sufficient reason to suspect that the Compliance Program is not being implemented effectively, Wilson will, at its own expense and if requested by the ACCC, cause an interim or additional Review to be conducted, and will provide the resulting Review Report to the ACCC. What follows are the reasons for the making of those consent orders. AGREED FACTS The parties together submit that the Court should make the orders sought as set out in a minute of proposed consent orders, having regard to the conduct of the first respondent. In that regard, the parties through their solicitors signed a statement of agreed facts dated 4 December 2009. The Court received this statement of agreed facts at the hearing of the application. As explained further below it appears to the Court that it is appropriate to regard the statement of agreed facts in determining whether or not to make orders in the proceeding by consent of the parties. The statement of agreed facts provides as follows. The applicant is, and was at all material times, a body corporate established by s 6A of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (Act). The respondent, Wilson Parking Australia 1992 Pty Ltd (Wilson), is, and was at all material times: a company duly incorporated and carrying on business in Australia; and a corporation within the meaning of the Act. Wilson is in the business of, among other things, providing mobile security patrol services (Patrol Services) to Customers in Western Australia through its security business division in Western Australia. Wilson performs Patrol Services by causing its patrol officers to conduct security inspections of Customers' premises (Calls). Typically, a patrol officer will be assigned a schedule (known as a \"run\") of premises to attend and inspect during a shift. That schedule typically includes premises owned by more than one Customer. Because Patrol Services are generally performed: (a) at times outside normal business hours; (b) without necessarily leaving any independent record of performance; and (c) in the physical absence of the Customers and their employees; it may be difficult for Customers to determine whether or not patrol officers have performed any particular number of Calls during a period. On various dates, Wilson entered into Contracts (Contracts) for the supply of Patrol Services with each of the entities listed (Customers) in column A of the Schedule attached to the accompanying Minute of Consent Orders (Schedule). But not reproduced in these reasons. It was a term of each Contract that: (a) in supplying the Patrol Services, Wilson would make a stated number of Calls at the Customer's premises in a specified service period (Contracted Calls); and (b) Wilson would use its best endeavours to provide the Contracted Calls, however interruptions or delays (or both) caused by break ins at any other Customers' premises and other emergencies including fire, flood, accident, police or emergency service activities may prevent all of the Contracted Calls being carried out during each service period (Permitted Missed Calls). This clause of each Contract was referred to by Wilson and is generally known in the security patrol industry as a \"shared services clause\" (Shared Services Clause). The purpose of a Shared Services Clause is to provide for the possibility that a patrol officer may be delayed or prevented from making a call to one Customer's premises during a run because the patrol officer needed to respond to a break-in or other emergency at another Customer's premises. During the period October 2007 to June 2008 (Relevant Period), Wilson had an insufficient number of patrol officers to make all of the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers. During the Relevant Period, for each month specified in each row of column D of the Schedule: (a) Wilson made the number of Calls specified in the corresponding row of column F of the Schedule (Actual Calls) to the premises of the Customers specified in the corresponding row of column B of the Schedule; (b) the Actual Calls fell short of the Contracted Calls by the number specified in the corresponding row of column G of the Schedule (Missed Calls); (c) Wilson Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; and (d) Wilson issued monthly Invoices (Invoices) to the Customers on the dates listed in column I of the Schedule for the amount due to be paid by the relevant Customer for the Contracted Calls for the relevant month. The amount of each invoice corresponded with the amount chargeable for the Contracted Calls. By issuing each of the Invoices, Wilson represented to each Customer that it had made the Contracted Calls in the preceding month, save for any Permitted Missed Calls (Call Representations). The Call Representations were false because: (a) the Actual Calls for each Customer fell short of the Contracted Calls by the specified number of Missed Calls in column G of the Schedule; and (b) Wilson Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls. From October 2007 to June 2008, Wilson knew: (a) that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to perform the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers; and (b) the matters set out in [15] above. From October 2007 to September 2008, Wilson refrained from: (a) informing any of the Customers of the number of Missed Calls; (b) informing any of the Customers that it Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls; (c) reducing the amount charged in the Invoices to less than the amount chargeable for the Contracted Calls; and (d) providing the Customers with a refund, credit or rebate in relation to any Missed Calls; when the Customers would reasonably have expected that, if Wilson had Missed Calls that were not Permitted Missed Calls, Wilson would have disclosed that fact to them. In October 2007, Wilson operational management in Western Australia identified to Wilson senior management in Victoria that it had an insufficient number of patrol officers to perform the Contracted Calls for all of the Customers. In early November 2007, Wilson senior management authorised and directed operational management to raise and pay credits to Customers for Missed Calls which were not Permitted Missed Calls. Due to a failure at an operational management level in Western Australia, credits, while provisioned in November, were not actually paid. From July 2008, Wilson was made aware of the ACCC's investigation of the conduct that is the subject of these proceedings, including the failure to pay credits or inform Customers about any failure to perform the Contracted Calls. Credits were then raised and paid by Wilson to Customers, backdated to and including October 2007 for Missed Calls, which were not Permitted Missed Calls, between October 2007 and June 2008. Wilson has raised and paid credits for all Missed Calls to Customers, whether or not they are Permitted Missed Calls, as follows: (a) in September 2008, Wilson processed $84,104 worth of credits for the period October 2007 --- January 2008; (b) in September 2009, Wilson processed $146,214.89 worth of credits for the period February 2008 --- July 2008; (c) from August 2008, Wilson has issued a manual adjustment note after each monthly invoice, crediting Customers for any Missed Calls during the month covered by that invoice. CONTRAVENING CONDUCT In the light of the agreed facts, the parties accept that Wilson contravened the Act in the manner alleged by the ACCC. The ACCC alleges that by making the Call Representations and refraining from informing its Customers of the true position, Wilson engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52(1) of the Act. It is understood that the conduct will be misleading if it induces or is capable of inducing error: Parkdale Custom Furniture Pty Ltd v Puxu Pty Ltd [1982] HCA 44 ; (1982) 149 CLR 191. It is not necessary to prove that anyone has in fact been misled. The ACCC further alleges that by making the Call Representations Wilson falsely represented that services were of particular value in contravention of s 53(aa) of the Act. A representation is false if it is contrary to fact. If the representation is not correct then it is false even if it is not false to the knowledge of the person making the representation: see Given v CV Holland (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1977) 29 FLR 212 , per Franki J at 217; Darwin Bakery Pty Ltd v Sully [1981] FCA 115 ; (1981) 51 FLR 90. In this regard the ACCC point to the Invoices issued by Wilson at material times that represented to Customers that they had received the security services bargained for. The Court accepts it is open to characterise the conduct of Wilson in the manner agreed by the parties. ORDERS SOUGHT Where a person has contravened s 52 and s 53(aa) of the Act, in a case such as the present, it is open to the Court on the application of a relevant party to grant relief of the following order: In this case, the parties agree that declarations, injunctions and non-punitive orders should be made under s 86. The ACCC advised the Court that it does not seek refunds or compensation orders under s 87 because: The ACCC suggests the Court may not make an order under s 83 of the Act, because this matter is proceeding on the basis of admissions rather than a contested trial and refer in this regard to Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Transmission and Distribution Ltd (No 2) [2002] FCA 559 ; (2002) 190 ALR 169 at 183 -184, per Finkelstein J. Whether or not his Honour's observations referred are intended to stand for such a hard and fast rule does not need to be determined here. The ACCC's enforcement mode in this case need not be questioned on the facts agreed. The Court also observes that the ACCC has not commenced proceedings under Pt VC of the Act and accordingly no pecuniary penalties may be ordered. The parties agree that declarations should be made in terms of proposed orders 1 and 2 of the minute of proposed orders. The Court has a wide discretion under s 21 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to make declarations of right. The declarations: The principles stated in Forster v Jododex Australia Pty Ltd [1972] HCA 61 ; (1972) 127 CLR 421 and applied by this Court in cases such as Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Goldy Motors Pty Ltd [2000] FCA 1885 at [30] support the making of the declarations in that: The proposed declarations are directed to the determination of a legal controversy not dealing with abstract or hypothetical questions, in that, ¾ the ACCC has alleged and Wilson admits to engaging in conduct in contravention of the Act; ¾ the proposed declarations determine that the conduct alleged contravened the Act in the manner stated; ¾ the ACCC is responsible for enforcing the Act and therefore has a real interest in seeking the proposed declarations; ¾ the relief sought is not hypothetical and the making of the proposed declarations will result in real consequences including vindication of the ACCC's claim that Wilson contravened the Act; will assist the ACCC in performing its statutory duties in relation to consumer's of small business because it may alert, or may be used to alert, relevant individuals and market participants of the kind of conduct that may contravene the Act; Wilson is a proper contradictor because it is a party whose conduct is referred to in the proposed declarations and who has an interest in opposing them; and the making of the proposed declarations is in the public interest. They will serve to mark the Court's disapproval of the particular conduct engaged in, in contravention of the Act. I am satisfied that the declarations should be made. To the extent that it is suggested that the Court should not make declarations in such circumstances, where public rights are an issue, unless there is \"evidence\" before the Court, I am satisfied that it is appropriate for the Court to make the declarations sought on the basis of the information currently before the Court, including the statement of agreed facts signed by the parties. See generally my observations in Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Cosic Holdings Pty Ltd [2009] FCA 1579 at [49] --- [51]. So far as the injunctions are concerned, the Court has the power under s 80 of the Act to make them. In the nature of public interest injunctions. Consequently the injunctions are statutory in nature and not granted pursuant to the Court's equitable jurisdiction. As s 80(4) and s 80(5) of the Act suggest, the Court has a wider jurisdiction to grant the injunction under s 80 than at general law, although traditional equity principles are not irrelevant. See ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission [1992] FCA 474 ; (1992) 38 FCR 248. Injunctions can be made under s 80 if it is in the public interest to do so: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v 4WD Systems Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 850 ; (2003) 200 ALR 491 at [212] and [216]. The public interest may warrant the making of an injunction notwithstanding the contravener is not likely to repeat that conduct: see Trade Practices Commission v Mobil Oil Australia Ltd [1984] FCA 363 ; (1984) 4 FCR 296 at 300, per Toohey J; Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Dimmeys Stores Pty Ltd (2001) ATPR 41 --- 811 at [32]. In this case an injunction is sought in the public interest to reduce the risk that Wilson will engage in similar conduct in the future that contravenes Pt V of the Act. I accept that the admitted facts disclose a sufficient nexus between the conduct alleged and the orders sought: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Z-Tek Computer Pty Ltd (1987) 148 ALR 339. I also accept that the proposed injunction is sufficiently clearly and precisely stated to be capable of being complied with and would not require Court supervision: see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Real Estate Institute of Western Australia Inc [1999] FCA 18 ; (1999) 161 ALR 79 at [26] . The particular injunction sought to some extent requires Wilson to comply with the law, however it also has regard to the actual practices of the respondent and the circumstances in which it deals with Missed Calls. It provides for refunds to Customers in certain circumstances. It is apparent therefore that the injunction if granted does more than admonish the respondent to comply with the law. In the circumstances I consider the injunction to be appropriate. The parties also request the Court to make orders pursuant to s 86C that would cause Wilson to send a letter to Customers advising them of the Court's judgment, findings and the remedies granted and also requiring Wilson to establish and maintain a compliance policy for three years. The letter to Customers will achieve the result of advising them of the nature and extent of Wilson's conduct in contravention of the Act and the outcome of the proceeding. It will protect consumers by alerting them to the fact that the conduct occurred, increase their awareness of the type of conduct that may breach the Act and encourage Customers to ensure that they receive the services to which they have contracted, and it is appropriate for such orders to be made. The compliance policy is intended to prevent further incidence of the conduct in future by ensuring that Wilson has procedures in place to educate its employees about the type of conduct that may breach the Act. These compliance orders are consistent with the purpose of s 86C which is raising awareness of the type of conduct that may contravene the Act and as to the outcome of particular litigation: as to which see Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v On Clinic Australia Pty Ltd (1996) ATPR 41 --- 517. CONCLUSION AND ORDERS For these reasons I am satisfied that the orders proposed by the parties in the minute of proposed consent orders should be made. I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Barker.

Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society Limited controls in Australia the right to reproduce certain musical works. APRA administers licences issued by AMCOS. Between them, APRA and AMCOS own or control the right in Australia to communicate to the public or reproduce many works which are the subject of copyright under the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). 2 In mid 2003 Monster Communications Pty Limited began a business of providing downloads of copyright works to mobile telephone customers through the use of telephone services provided by Telstra Corporation Limited and other telecommunications licensed carriers. Among other services that Monster has provided are downloads of monophonic and polyphonic ringtones. And, from late 2005 until June 2006 Monster also provided a service to its customers where they could download what are known as MP3 files onto their mobile phones. 3 Monster advertised its services nationally. The advertisements invited consumers to acquire downloads from Monster either by sending a short message service (known as SMS) text message or by making an interactive voice response (IVR) telephone call to a 1900 telephone number. Customers access the SMS services by sending a text message from their mobile phone to a telephone number together with a code requesting a particular product download. When the SMS message is received, Monster's telecommunications service provider processes the request by sending it to Monster and collects or arranges to collect Monster's advertised price from its customer. Next, Monster processes the request through its computer systems. The end result is that the consumer receives on the screen of his or her mobile phone a download of what was ordered: viz; a monophonic, polyphonic or MP3 ringtone, a colour message or a picture. 4 Customers access the IVR services by telephoning the 1900 number and progressing through a series of steps during the call with similar end results. In addition, if the customer makes an IVR call, he or she can place more than one order for downloads of any of Monster's advertised products. A telecommunications agreement between Monster and Telstra for IVR calls was in place between June 2003 and 1 May 2005. It provided that the first 24 seconds of any IVR call were free and thereafter the call was charged to Monster at an agreed rate. Monster's advertisements informed consumers of their ability to order more than one of its advertised download products in the same 1900 call. The advertisements made an offer that if the consumer ordered three downloads, he or she would get one free (with no limits and in any combination). 5 When a customer ordered a ringtone or image download through either the SMS or IVR services, Monster reproduced the image or ringtone thus attracting the royalties to which AMCOS is entitled. Each of Monster and its telecommunications service provider then communicated the ringtone or image download to the consumer thus generating the royalties to which APRA is entitled. In both cases the royalties became payable in respect of works the copyright in which either APRA or AMCOS controlled or APRA owned. 6 Ringtone services have developed into an important market for APRA and AMOCS since the year ended 30 June 2002, when they had 18 licensees. In subsequent years the numbers grew, peaking at 62 in the year ended 30 June 2004. There were 49 in the year ended 30 June 2005. As at 30 June 2006 there were 47 licensees although there had been 56 current at one point during that year. 7 Licensees are required to produce to APRA and AMCOS their telephone service provider statements of account. Those statements record, among other information, that total revenue collected by the provider from customers downloading licensees' ringtones and other services and the net amounts remitted to the ringtone licensee from those collections. Each licensee makes a return to APRA or AMCOS identifying what part of the revenues disclosed in the providers' statements are attributable to downloads of licensed works. A calculation is then made of the royalties due. Based on returns prepared by the licensees under their agreements with APRA and AMCOS, they calculated that, on their estimate, Monster's share of revenue from the ringtone services market in Australia was in the order of 8% of the market. 8 Shortly after Monster commenced its business in July 2003, it became aware that it was obliged to obtain licences from APRA and AMCOS for many of the copyright works used in its business. After some long negotiations, the parties entered into four different agreements dated 1 January 2005 which took effect as from 1 July 2003 for the IVR licences (cl 3) and 1 October 2004 for the SMS licences (cl 3) so as to provide for royalties during the preceding, as well as future, periods. Monster entered into an agreement with each of APRA and AMCOS respectively for the provision of IVR services and SMS services. Apart from the identity of the parties to each agreement, the relevant provisions of each IVR agreement and each SMS agreement were, in many respects, materially similar although there were some substantial differences. 9 In August 2005 APRA and AMCOS terminated the IVR licences for non-payment of interim invoices for royalties. Those invoices were issued after an audit by Deloitte of Monster's financial information following Monster's failure to provide to APRA and AMCOS relevant financial information under their IVR licences. The SMS licences were terminated in December 2005 because of Monster's failure to provide any statements from its telecommunications service providers from which royalties could be calculated. During the period covered by each of the licences before their termination, Monster paid no royalties at all. Subsequently Monster paid some royalties. 10 Monster's records were audited by Deloitte. The audit revealed substantial deficiencies in and unreliability of Monster's records. Monster's financial records for 9 May 2005 evince a very significant, two-thirds, decline at midnight on that date in the number of downloads it provided (i.e. from about 37,000 in its previous records to, about 13,000) (T 192.6) from which it never recovered. The expert evidence said there was no explanation for that fall or its magnitude. 11 Monster argued that APRA and AMCOS had failed to provide it with any specification of the financial information they required under each of the SMS and IVR licences and that accordingly, it was not in breach of any obligation under them. Monster argued that the termination of each of the licences was invalid. The parties entered into negotiations for the grant of new IVR licences to take effect immediately following the termination of the original ones. Monster argued that it was able effectively to accept that offer three months after it had been made in circumstances where, in the interim, the SMS licences had also been terminated and APRA and AMCOS were threatening to take it to court if it did not pay a substantial sum for past royalties. Monster has continued to provide downloads of copyright works relying on its argument that the terminations of each of the licences were invalid. 12 The construction of the SMS and IVR licences, and in particular the formulae for the payment of royalties, is at the heart of the present proceedings. APRA and AMCOS contend that Monster has not accounted properly for the royalties which are due under the IVR and SMS licences. Monster contends that it has in fact overpaid those royalties. RINGTONES 13 A ringtone is a fragment of a musical work in digital form which is intended to be delivered to and to function as the ring of a mobile telephone: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR 1 at 3 [9] per Lindgren P. The President found that in storing ringtones on its computers, a ringtone supplier makes a reproduction of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones for the purposes of s 31(1)(a)(i) of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth). In electronically transmitting ringtones to a mobile telephone, the ringtone supplier exercises the right of communication to the public in respect of those parts of the musical works embodied in the ringtones (s 31(1)(a)(iv) of the Act: s 10(1) contains a definition of the word 'communicate' as meaning to 'make available online or electronically transmit ... a work or other subject matter'). By providing an IVR service, a ringtone supplier authorizes the making of the copy of the ringtones which are created in the customer's mobile telephones upon electronic transmission of them (for the purposes of s 36 of the Act) (175 FLR at 4 [11]-[13]). THE SMS LICENCES 14 Relevantly, each of the SMS licences dated 1 January 2005 is in identical terms, except for the fees payable under Schedule 1, the identity of the licensors and an extra clause in the AMCOS version regulating reproduction of musical works (cl 5). Each SMS licence commenced on 1 October 2004 (cl 3). APRA was entitled to a fee for monophonic or polyphonic format ringtones of 1.1% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 1.65cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. The fee for phonographic format (i.e. MP3) ringtones was 2.2% (inclusive of GST) of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of $3.30 per sale. At all times, Monster charged consumers, according to its advertisements $3.50 per ringtone downloaded via an SMS service. 15 AMCOS was entitled to a fixation fee of $11 in respect of each new AMCOS work added to the licensee's inventory in the quarter for which the fees were payable. In addition, the licensee had to pay AMCOS a fee for each ringtone of 11% inclusive of GST of the retail price subject to a minimum fee of 16.5cents (inclusive of GST) per sale. 16 Each SMS licence recited the capacity in which the relevant licensor acted. APRA owned or controlled for Australia the exclusive right of public performance and communication to the public in relation to the relevant work (Recital A). AMCOS controlled in Australia the right to reproduce the AMCOS works (Recital A). The licensee was described as being in the business of providing customised mobile telephone ringtones for sale 'at a fixed rate per sale ... by means of premium rate short message services ... and/or through the proprietary networks of telecommunication carriers' (Recital B). The licence then recited that the licensee required a licence from the relevant licensor to pursue that business activity. 17 The licensee was required to pay the licence fee calculated in accordance with the formula set out in schedule 1 (cl 4). The AMCOS SMS licence contained a clause 5 which was not in the APRA equivalent. That clause required the licensee to notify AMCOS within 14 days of the date of the agreement of the names of the ringtones it wished to reproduce (cl 5.2). 18 Monster was required, within 14 days after the end of each quarter, to provide to the licensor the revenue and music use information described in schedule 2 in the form 'prescribed by [the licensor] from time to time' (APRA cl 5, AMCOS cl 6). The licensee was required to keep accurate books of account and other records in sufficient detail to ensure that all amounts payable to the licensor under the agreement could be properly ascertained (cl 7). 19 Each SMS licence contained a provision entitling APRA (cl 10.1(a)) and AMCOS (cl 11.1(a)) to terminate it immediately by notice if Monster breached any term of the licence and failed to remedy the breach within 7 days of being required to do so. 20 In Schedule 2, each SMS licence required the licensee to supply within 14 days after the end of each quarter a detailed account of ringtone sales in that quarter for each separate ringtone service operated by the licensee, which was defined as a sales report. The sales report had to identify for each separate work offered for sale during the quarter among other things the title of the work, identifying whether the work was an APRA or AMCOS work or not and the price at which it was sold. Critically, Schedule 2 went on to provide: 'In a format acceptable to [the licensor] , the licensee must also supply [to the licensor] within 30 days after the end of each Quarter, copies of actual revenue statements (including but not limited to details of items delivered, items billed, gross revenue, price points and period covered as relevant) provided by the relevant telecommunications carriers and service providers responsible for collecting revenue in relation to the Purpose. ' The schedule concluded that if the price of a particular ringtone changed during each quarter or it was sold at different prices, then separate line entries were required to be made for each price so that a correct licence fee could be calculated. THE IVR LICENCES 21 Each IVR licence had provided that the licensee had to a licence fee calculated in accordance with a formula set out in schedule 1 (cl 4). As with the SMS licences, the AMCOS licence alone contained a cl 5 in similar terms to the AMCOS SMS licence. The licensee, as with the SMS licences, within 14 days after the end of each quarter had to provide the licensor with the revenue and music use information described in schedule 2 in the form prescribed by the licensor from time to time (APRA cl 5, AMCOS cl 6). 22 On receipt by the licensor of the information under cl 5 or cl 6, the licensor had to calculate the licence fee for the quarter in accordance with cl 4 (APRA cl 6.1, AMCOS cl 7.1). The licensee was then required to pay any invoice issued by the licensor within 14 days after the date of invoice. However, if the licensor received information pursuant to an audit or examination which could be required under cl 8 (or cl 9 for AMCOS), it was entitled to issue an invoice for any additional licence fee payable and the licensee had to pay that invoice within 14 days after its date (APRA cl 6.3, AMCOS cl 7.3). The licensee was again required to keep accurate books of account and other records in sufficient detail to ensure that all amounts payable to the licensor under the agreement could be properly ascertained (APRA cl 7, AMCOS cl 8). 23 Each IVR licence contained a termination clause in the same terms as the SMS licences (APRA cl 10, AMCOS cl 11). 24 Schedule 1 of the IVR licences provided for a formula for the payment of fees. In each formula, the APRA call revenue and AMCOS call revenue were defined as 'ACR'. ACR was calculated by multiplying what was defined as NCR (net call revenue) by the fraction comprised of the total number downloads of the licensors' works by the total number of downloads delivered by the IVR service. Relevantly, where, as is common ground here, the average price per ringtone was greater than $1.50, the licensee had to pay APRA a licence fee for monophonic ringtones of 1.1%, and for polyphonic ones 2.2% of the APRA call revenue (inclusive of GST) (Schedule 1, 2/105). Under the AMCOS agreement the licence fee, where the average price per ringtone was greater than $1.50, was 11% of the AMCOS call revenue (inclusive of GST). 25 The calculation in Schedule 1 was designed to identify the proportion of works within the control of APRA and AMCOS respectively in the overall revenue generated by the operations of the licensee. NCR was defined as meaning the gross call revenue 'less bad debts actually written off and less the connection fee actually charged by the telecommunication service provider responsible for providing the carriage of the IVR service'. Gross call revenue was defined as meaning the gross earnings of the licensee together with the earnings of any or all of its agents, partners, affiliates and income sharers (including without limitation any telecommunications company or service provider or bureau) directly or indirectly receivable during the quarter in respect of or otherwise in relation to the IVR service. 26 Thus, the concept behind gross call revenue was to capture the charge which the telecommunications company made its subscriber pay when accessing and arranging downloads from Monster's services. Consumers would be billed by or have payments deducted from their accounts by their telecommunications services provider. Thus, a consumer wishing to purchase a download from a Monster advertisement would telephone a 1900 number for an IVR service. Telstra provided Monster with the 1900 numbers. Not all Monster's customers were, however, Telstra customers. Thus, Telstra would have to collect, from the customers or their telecommunications providers, the money which Monster advertised was the cost of the relevant download. Telstra and Monster entered into a contract for the provision of the IVR services in June 2003. THE TEMPLATE DISPUTE 27 Mr Richard Mallett has worked for APRA for about 10 years and has been APRA's director of mechanical licensing since early 2002. He has had extensive experience in the licensing activities of APRA and AMCOS. He first became aware of Monster's activities in about August 2003 and was the officer of APRA and AMCOS responsible for dealings with Monster. 28 Mr Jansen Chong (the second respondent) is Monster's sole director. He graduated a Bachelor of Laws with Honours from the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom in 1991. During the course of that degree he gained some understanding of intellectual property matters. Between 1993 and 1996 he held the rank of Inspector with the Singapore Police Force and performed both investigative and staff functions. After he left the Singapore Police Force he held positions as marketing and strategic development manager with a number of companies that introduced him to the download technology that Monster uses in its business. From January 2002 for about a year he was the general manger of Powercom which carries on a business in Australia similar to that of Monster. He was in charge of Powercom's marketing delivery systems. While there, he improved its ringtone products and developed graphic products to add to its principal business being a provider of chat room services. After leaving Powercom Mr Chong established Monster and commenced business in July 2003. 29 On 20 January 2005 Mr Mallett and two other representatives of APRA and AMCOS had a meeting during the course of which Mr Chong said that Monster could not provide sales figures for the last 18 months. Mr Mallett responded that he was sure that they could come up with a commercial solution to that problem. Discussion turned to the reporting requirements under APRA's standard form licence agreements. Mr Mallett said that APRA and AMCOS did not currently require some of the information that was referred to in Schedule 2, including the unique identifying numbers for works and IVR numbers. He said that APRA and AMCOS would make the calculation of net call revenue directly from the Telstra statements and that Monster did not need to provide additional supporting information. 30 Mr Mallett said at that time APRA and AMCOS did not have a fixed or prescribed format in their electronic data interchange (EDI) specification that they would send to Monster later that day. He said that those specifications were due to come into force in September 2005 and that some items in Schedule 2 (in the IVR licences) including identifying numbers and IVR numbers were not required for the moment. He told Mr Chong that in the meantime sales information should be provided in electronic format and they would work with Monster. Mr Mallett said that APRA and AMCOS would make the calculation of net call revenue directly from the Telstra statements and that Monster did not need to provide additional supporting information. Later that day Mr Mallett sent a letter to Mr Chong attaching the draft EDI specification which he said he was assured by the technicians made sense to them. The letter said that they expected the first reports to be in the format of the draft for the July-September quarter. 31 In his evidence, Mr Mallett agreed that the letter of 20 January 2005 conveyed that the template was a draft and that there would be no mandatory requirement till later that year (T 101.21-.25). He said the template in the EDI specification which was sent on 20 January 2005 by APRA and AMCOS to Monster was to be used as a form of guide as to how the specification should be completed (T 99.25-100.42). 32 On 11 February 2005 Mr Chong wrote to Mr Mallett. He enclosed copies of the IVR and SMS licences executed by Monster. In the letter Mr Chong requested a template from APRA/AMCOS of the correct layout required for the detailed sales report and information which Monster had to provide under the licence agreements. Mr Chong then set out what he called a detailed sales report for the quarter ending 30 September 2003. That simply listed the number of sales of mono and polyphonic ringtones for each of the three months. He also asked for the correct or accepted format with which to provide additional data, such as the song titles and artists, in order to be able to calculate the royalties due. 33 On the same day, APRA and AMCOS's solicitors (Banki Haddock Fiora) wrote to Monster's then solicitors (Griffith Hack Lawyers) noting that Monster had provided signed licence agreements relating to the ringtone service which Monster offered together with some sales information in relation to the September 2003 quarter. They said that Monster had not provided any revenue information. They drew attention to Monster's failure to provide, as required by each licence agreement, full details of sales of ringtones, including statements from telecommunication service providers. Banki Haddock Fiora also asserted that Monster's licence fee obligations were significant. They said it was expected to comply with the agreements. 34 Between 11 February 2005 and early March 2005 Mr Chong and Mr Mallett had at least one and possibly more conversations to the following effect (T 102.15-.30): 'Mr Chong: Richard, I need to know the format and information you need from me to supply you with the quarterly reports. I also need you to tell me which of the ringtones are APRA/AMCOS works. Mr Mallett: Don't worry about that. We'll give you something. We'll give you a format later this year. You just provide all your sales figures and Telstra revenue returns. ' 35 After this conversation APRA/AMCOS sent an email on 4 March 2005 to Mr Chong noting that they had processed the licence agreements and they were sending a copy of the executed versions in the mail. The email continued: 'We have attached a Digital Download Sales Reporting guide and an example EDI [electronic data interchange] template which labels each field as required under our EDI specifications. Please complete and return as soon as possible'. (emphasis added) Although the attachment clearly showed that the status of the document was a draft, the template format which it contained had a detailed description of what was required for reporting download transactions. That included descriptive explanations of mandatory fields in the template and of information to be provided (such as the record type, work title, the writers, the performers and the quantity. Optional items included certain reference information identifying the downloaded work). 36 All other licensees of APRA and AMCOS have conformed to these requirements and reported without difficulty. 37 Mr Chong read the material in the email of 4 March, as he had the material with the letter of 20 January 2005, when he received them (T 133.8). 38 Mr Chong said that he did not want to give APRA or AMCOS a bare list of sales and core revenues from which they would unilaterally determine licence fees and in circumstances where he would not have any idea what figure they might determine was payable. After receiving both EDI documents, he said that he was concerned that they were both drafts which might change and that they appeared to describe a system specification to allow interchange of information electronically between APRA and AMCOS and its licensees such as Monster. 39 Mr Chong also asserted that the fact that these documents were drafts was significant to him because Monster's computer software would have to be altered to enable it to access the data and produce the specified reports. That would entail a cost and, he asserted, more importantly the testing of Monster's systems after they had been altered to ensure that the required changes did not create bugs or damage any part of the system. He also expressed concern that an alteration of the computer system to accommodate a draft specification created the real possibility that if the final specification differed, there would have to be a subsequent alteration at additional cost and with additional testing procedures. He understood that it was a computer industry rule and standard that computer systems not be altered by reference to draft specifications for those reasons. 40 Mr Chong was taken through the draft EDI specification attached to the email of 4 March 2005 in cross-examination. He was asked about his concerns to do with the draft EDI format by being taken to the requirements for different fields individually. For example, he was asked about whether he knew enough about the systems to know what a header row was. Mr Chong said that he did not know because APRA and AMCOS had never discussed it with him and he did not recognise the acronym 'HDR' as a symbol for the header row (T 132.45-133.5). When he was taken to the descriptive definition in the draft EDI specification, it was clear that the acronym referred to a file header record comprising seven fields of mandatory information identifying with precision what was required. Next, Mr Chong said that one of those fields was not readily available, namely the sender's identification number. Given that that was a number to be allocated to Monster, as sender, by APRA and AMCOS, his professed concern was transparently illusory (T 134.3-.14). 41 After being taken through the draft document in cross-examination, which he had read at the time he received it, he agreed that it was relatively straightforward for Monster to provide information in that format, after making obvious assumptions (T136.18-.22). He had made no investigation of the cost of attempting to comply with the draft format, despite what he had put in his affidavit to suggest this was a concern of his (T 136.39-.47). 42 Mr Chong is a very intelligent person. The draft EDI format was not difficult to understand and, when he was taken through it, it was obvious that he was readily able to understand it. I do not accept his evidence that the reason he did not implement the draft, notwithstanding the email of 4 March 2005, was because of any concerns or difficulties he had with the document. 43 Mr Chong also asserted that Schedule 2 of the licences required Monster to provide information about which works were APRA or AMCOS works, the unique identifying number of those works and the identifying telephone number of the IVR service. He listed the problems he had with complying with the quarterly requirements in Schedule 2 is each licence as being that he had no way of knowing whether or not any particular ringtone was an APRA or AMCOS work or had an APRA or AMCOS identifying number or was sold through a particular one or more of Monster's thirty or so IVR service lines. But Mr Mallett had told him on 20 January 2005 that the second and third items of this list were not required. I am not satisfied that Mr Chong had any difficulty concerning the identifying numbers or IVR phone lines. 44 It was Monster's obligation under the AMCOS IVR and SMS licences to provide a list to APRA and AMCOS of the musical works it wished to reproduce in the form of ringtones under the agreement within 14 days of the date of each licence agreement (cl 5.2). Whether the relevant works were those of APRA or AMCOS was for Monster to ascertain. I am not satisfied Mr Chong was concerned about this at all. Monster did not provide a list under cl 5 of the AMCOS licences. Other examples were put to Mr Chong in cross-examination of instances when he, or companies he controlled, including Monster, used works for which they had made no arrangements with the owner of copyright, but only ceased the user when the owner complained. By 31 March 2005 no royalties had been paid by Monster under the IVR licences, which were expressed to have commenced on 1 July 2003, some 21 months before and none had been paid under the SMS licences which had been expressed to commence on 1 October 2004. 45 I find that Monster and Mr Chong deliberately refrained from providing to APRA and AMCOS the information to the effect of that sought in the draft EDI specification as qualified by Mr Mallett so as to avoid paying for as long as possible what was due to the collecting societies. Mr Chong gave no explanation as to Monster's or his failure to communicate with APRA or AMCOS about any difficulties or concerns after the 4 March 2005 email. This deliberate default continued throughout 2005. The email of 4 March 2005 was the last relevant communication on the question of what APRA and AMCOS required to be provided. There was no basis on which Monster was entitled to ignore the requirements in the email to use the template provided and to return the information as soon as possible. Mr Mallett's earlier conversation had identified the Telstra revenue returns as being sufficient to comply with the telecommunications service provider information specified in Schedule 2. 46 I am satisfied that Monster was aware that APRA and AMCOS had specified to it the form in which the information required was to be provided for the purposes of each licence. I do not believe Mr Chong's evidence that he had any concerns or difficulties about the provision of that material in the form of the draft specification. THE IVR LICENCES DISPUTE 47 On 24 March 2005 Mr Mallett wrote to Mr Chong noting that Monster had still not provided relevant Telstra revenue statements or any further information beyond what was in Monster's letter of 11 February 2005. Mr Mallett noted that that position was untenable. He said there had been a failure to provide APRA and AMCOS with the information required to calculate the licence fees. Acting on cl 8 of the agreements with APRA and cl 9 of the agreements with AMCOS, he informed Monster that on or after 25 April 2005 they would conduct an audit of the books of account and other records of Monster in order to obtain that information. 48 On 14 April 2005 Mr Mallett notified Mr Chong that the audit would commence on 27 April 2005 and that APRA and AMCOS had appointed Deloitte as auditors. Among other things Mr Mallett noted that Monster should have available to the auditor statements provided by Telstra in relation to all IVR lines operated by Monster for the purposes of supplying ringtones, computer records detailing the mix of ringtone and non-ringtone material ordered by calls using those IVR lines and all other relevant records including computer records and associated metadata detailing the ringtones ordered from the commencement of the service to 31 March 2005. 49 In late May 2005 Deloitte reported to APRA and AMCOS. The key findings in its audit report included the following: (a) Monster's revenues excluding GST from downloads for all content types totalled about $7.23 million for the period 1 July 2003 to 31 March 2005 based on Monster's financial records. This was consistent both with revenues disclosed in monthly revenue statements provided by Telstra and Monster's quarterly business activity statements. (b) Monster's financial records did not contain a breakdown of revenues per content type so as to enable identification of whether they were earned for the supply of ringtones, games, colour pictures or other categories of services which Monster offered. (c) There was no record of payment or of provision for licence fees due to APRA or AMCOS in Monster's financial records. (d) Revenue from ringtone and polyphonic downloads could not be conclusively calculated with the data provided by Monster. (e) Historical log files for the IVR server and database backup types were not provided or available in the information Monster provided to Deloitte. (f) While Deloitte had sighted the log file for the IVR server on 29 April 2005, it was missing from the system when analysed again on 3 May 2005 and Monster provided no explanation for the anomaly. (g) It was not possible to validate independently database records based on the information provided by Monster to Deloitte. This was said to be due to a number of factors including the masking of mobile numbers which purchased relevant services, the absence of or failure to provide log files and the absence of or failure to provide historical system backups. (h) Deloitte's analysis of the electronic data provided by Monster in relation to sales and downloads suggested: • Monster's sales data could not be linked by volume or value to revenue figures set out in the Telstra statements, Monster's own MYOB accounting records or its BAS statements; • Notwithstanding that it was difficult, given the data provided by Monster, to ascertain definitively the number of downloads purchased by a customer in a single call session, it appeared to Deloitte that there was an inconsistency in the sales data which enabled Deloitte to imply: - in the case of monophonic and polyphonic ringtones, the number of single download sessions exceeded the number of double download sessions and the number of double download sessions exceeded the number of treble download sessions and so on; - however, for other content types (i.e. ones on which no royalties were due to APRA or AMCOS) unusually high frequencies of triple downloads were observed by Deloitte. Deloitte noted that Monster had advised that that finding possibly indicated a 'bug in the system'; (i) Deloitte said that it was not clear if there were business or commercial reasons for their conclusions from the electronic data analysis but that in the absence of explanation or additional reliable information of the kind that they had requested, Deloitte's observations raised significant concerns as to the accuracy or legitimacy of the sales data provided by Monster. 50 Deloitte regarded as significant what was described in the evidence as a 'triple download spike' in Monster's computer records of sales activities. Monster's internal reporting had rows of data entries arranged under a number of columns. The columns included a date and time column for the telephone call ordering the particular product or products. There was provision for the caller number (where it was available) to be given, the identification of a port, a telephone number on which the call was made to place the order, the mobile number to which the service was to be sent, the identity of the mobile operator, the content type, the identification number within Monster's records of the service provided, a commencement date and, critically, a column headed 'num_of_dl' (which was an acronym for the number of downloads). The triple download spike was contained in the num_of_dl column. 51 Deloitte had detected that out of a total of about 1.3 million downloads during the seven quarters they examined, there were about 700,000 entries in the number of downloads column with the recorded number 3. They understood this to mean that the relevant download against which the number 3 was placed was the third download by the customer in a sequence of downloads. However, only about 370,000 entries had the number 1 recorded in the number of downloads column and about 100,000 had the number 2. Thus, the apparent number of third downloads recorded exceeded the apparent numbers of single and double downloads. That did not appear to make sense, hence the explanation that was offered by Monster that there was a 'bug in the system'. 52 Deloitte also tallied Monster's total data with data for monophonic and polyphonic services, for which royalties were payable to APRA and AMCOS and compared the download numbers with the other services Monster was providing its customers. About 90,000, monophonic ringtones were recorded with one download in the number of downloads column, about 20,000 with two downloads and about 12,400 with three. Likewise, there were about 83,000 polyphonic downloads with one download recorded, 20,000 with two and 13,000 with three. So, while Monster's records indicated that its other services attracted a massive number of entries with the number 3 in the number of downloads column, for the two royalty generating services, monophonic and polyphonic ringtones, the number of 'third' downloads was quite out of proportion to the other entries in the database. The triple download spike thus occurred almost only in relation to non-ringtone sales. 53 Monster received a copy of Deloitte's report in June 2005. Based on Deloitte's report, APRA and AMCOS raised invoices on Monster on an interim basis for royalties on the IVR agreements. APRA claimed an interim fee of $16,079.94, while AMCOS claimed an interim fee of $188,867.35. APRA and AMCOS also claimed the audit costs of $37,400 as due under the relevant licences. When Monster failed to pay any of these invoices, AMCOS caused a creditor's statutory demand under s 459E(2)(e) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) to be served on Monster alleging non-payment of the $37,400 debt for the audit fee. Ultimately, Monster paid that fee in late July 2005, within the time permitted under the statutory demand. 54 On 22 July 2005 Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to Monster's new solicitors, CG Gillis & Co, demanding full payment of the licence fee invoices by 29 July 2005. Monster did not pay any money for licence fees within that time. Thus, APRA and AMCOS had received no IVR royalties at all from Monster for the term of the IVR licences commencing on 1 July 2003. On 17 August 2005 AMCOS and APRA terminated each of the IVR licences. 55 Soon afterward Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to Monster saying that they were instructed that APRA and AMCOS would withdraw the notice of termination if Monster paid the full amount of the licence fee invoices by 25 August 2005. CG Gillis & Co responded on 25 August 2005 raising a number of arguments that the notice of termination was invalid. Only one of those arguments is still pressed. That is that APRA and AMCOS had over claimed because they had applied gross call revenues of about $8.34 million instead of the amount of net call revenue of about $7.2 million to the calculation of royalties. 56 After APRA and AMCOS had given the notice of termination of the IVR agreements on 17 August 2005, Bank Haddock Fiora sent a facsimile to CG Gillis & Co threatening to initiate 'take down' procedures which involved seeking to have Telstra disconnect Monster's IVR services. Ultimately, Telstra did not act on a notice that was served, although had it done so it would have considerable impact on Monster's overall business. 57 On 14 September 2005 Monster offered to pay the full amount of the outstanding interim IVR royalties invoices in consideration of APRA and AMCOS granting new licences together with certain other conditions. Thereafter, the solicitors for the parties communicated with each other exchanging draft new IVR licences. 58 On 16 September 2005 Monster paid APRA and AMCOS $150,000 and on 14 October 2005 the balance of $54,947.29 owing under the two IVR licence invoices issued earlier that year was paid. 59 On 24 October 2005 Banki Haddock Fiora sent for execution by Monster a draft agreement settling their present dispute on the old IVR licences, together with draft new IVR licences commencing with effect from 18 August 2005. CG Gillis & Co responded on 27 October 2005 with some proposed variations to the draft documents. The next day Banki Haddock Fiora responded with a set of draft documents which simply incorporated the changes suggested by Monster's solicitors. No response to that letter of 28 October 2005 was received from Monster until 7 February 2006 when CG Gillis & Co returned the three executed agreements to Banki Haddock Fiora. In the meantime, the parties had had a substantial dispute over the SMS licences, which, as will appear shortly, were terminated by APRA and AMCOS on 12 December 2005. SMS LICENCES DISPUTE 60 On 2 September 2005, Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to CG Gillis & Co noting that, despite requests, Monster had failed to provide APRA and AMCOS with any revenue or music use information for the three quarters ending 30 June 2005. In addition, the letter stated that the revenue and music use information required to be provided within 30 days after the end of each quarter under schedule 2 of the SMS licences had not been provided. It demanded, pursuant to cl 10.1(a) of the APRA SMS agreement, and cl 11.1(a) of the AMCOS SMS agreement that Monster provide each of APRA and AMCOS with its music use and revenue information in respect of the 3 quarters specified. The references to the two clauses were to the termination provisions in each SMS agreement which entitled the licensor to terminate it immediately by notice to the licensee if the latter had breached any term of the agreement and failed to remedy the breach within 7 days after being required in writing to do so by the licensor. APRA and AMCOS demanded, pursuant to their rights under the SMS agreements, that within 7 days Monster provide them with its music use and revenue information in respect of the three quarters. On 26 September 2005 Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to CG Gillis & Co, confirming that the SMS agreements remained on foot, but made a further demand for the music use and revenue information for the three quarters ending 30 June 2005. 61 Banki Haddock Fiora wrote again on 30 November 2005, this time in noting that APRA and AMCOS had not received Monster's revenue and music use information for the 4 quarters to 30 September 2005. A further demand was made, invoking each of the termination clauses, for that information to be provided within 7 days. It is common ground that Monster did not provide any SMS licence information in answer to any of the 3 letters of demand. Thus, on 12 December 2005 Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to CG Gillis & Co terminating each of the SMS agreements. It is in that context that consideration needs to be given as to whether the offer of APRA and AMCOS to enter into new IVR agreements, which had been made on 28 October 2005, continued to remain open for acceptance up to 7 February 2006. 62 In late January 2006 Monster made a payment of $15,000 to APRA and AMCOS said to be on account of amounts due under the SMS agreements. Monster paid a further $15,000 on 16 February 2006. On 7 April 2006, Monster paid a further $80,891.76. That was the last payment which Monster has made to either of the applicants. The January 2006 payment was said to be on account of amounts due under the SMS licences. The money paid in February 2006 was not able to be allocated to any particular obligation of Monster by Mr Mallett. 63 On 17 February 2006 APRA and AMCOS commenced these proceedings. ISSUES 64 The following issues arise: 1. What is the proper construction of the expression 'retail price' in the SMS licences? 2. Did APRA and AMCOS validly terminate the SMS licences on 12 December 2005? 3. What is the proper construction of the expression 'net call revenue' or 'NCR' in the IVR licences? 4. Did APRA and AMCOS validly terminate the IVR licences on 17 August 2005? 5. Was the offer of APRA and AMCOS made on 28 October 2005 to enter into new IVR licences and to settle the dispute: (a) open for acceptance by Monster as at 7 February 2006; (b) validly accepted by Monster on that date? 6. Is Monster entitled to an order that APRA and AMCOS grant it an IVR licences or its equivalent? 7. What is the quantum of licence fees payable by Monster for sales of ringtones or, APRA and AMCOS having elected to sue for damages, the damages payable for the infringements which occurred by sales at such times as Monster was not licensed? 8. Are APRA and AMCOS entitled to additional damages under s 115 of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth)? ISSUE 1: WHAT IS THE PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF THE EXPRESSION 'RETAIL PRICE' IN THE SMS LICENCES? 65 Monster argued that the expression 'retail price' in Schedule 1 of the SMS licences did not mean the price which Monster advertised to its customers that they would have to pay for the service. Rather, Monster argued that 'retail price' was, in effect, what it received after Telstra or Monster's other telecommunications service providers and others had deducted their fees and charged from the advertised price which they had collected from the customer. 66 Such a construction would defeat one of the principal purposes of the SMS licences. The APRA SMS licence was expressly granted for the purpose of communicating the ringtones via telecommunication services (cl 1.1). The licence operated to authorise Monster's use of telecommunications networks to deliver an SMS download to its customer. If Monster's construction were correct, part of the advertised price paid by the customer to receive the download would not be caught for royalty purposes. The licence authorised Monster to enter into the transaction through the use of the telecommunications networks by which Monster provided the download. The result of Monster's construction would be that the telecommunications carrier would communicate the downloaded ringtone but would not be subject to any royalty for that act of communication and Monster would only be charged for its act of communicating the work via the telecommunications network to the customer. There would thus be a lacuna in APRA's collection of royalties because that part of the price charged to Monster's customer which represented the fee or charge of the telecommunications network would be excluded. The position is analogous under the AMCOS SMS licence. 67 A commercial purpose of the SMS licences was to enable APRA and AMCOS to receive a percentage of the earnings of those seeking to exploit copyright works over which they had rights. The SMS licences authorized Monster to use telecommunications networks to communicate and reproduce the copyright ringtone. In ordinary English usage, 'retail price' is the amount paid by the customer for the goods or service. It is not the net amount the retailer receives after paying a sum not disclosed to the customer for the right to sell the goods or service. The term 'retail price' should be construed so as to avoid it making commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience, as Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby, Callinan and Heydon JJ said in Zhu v Treasurer of NSW [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] . They also said that the commercial purpose of reasonable persons in the position of the parties was relevant, as were the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context and the market in which the parties were operating, as known to each of them (218 CLR at 559 [82]). 68 A significant commercial purpose of the SMS licences was to enable the whole download procedure to be authorised by the licensors and for the money generated by the exploitation of the rights they granted to be used as the basis for calculating the royalty fee due respectively to each of APRA and AMCOS. 69 Moreover, it would be a very odd construction of the ordinary English language term 'retail price' to divorce the price advertised by Monster to the public as the price payable for the download, from the price on which Monster was liable to account for royalties. Monster organised through its various telecommunication contracts and licences with APRA and AMCOS, a situation in which members of the public could use their own telephones to obtain a service Monster had for sale. Monster contracted with the public by offering to sell the SMS download to them for the price of $3.50 in its advertisements. That involved Monster becoming an agent, or using agents, to ensure that the transaction was carried out so the consumer received that for which he or she paid. Monster needed to charge its customer a price to cover its costs of delivering the download. 70 The use of agents raises issues concerning privity of contract in commercial dealings where people buy and sell goods and services over the internet, by use of the telephone or SMSs. No doubt many of these arrangements hide, in their simplicity, a web of underlying contractual relationships. But the customer who read an advertisement such as Monster placed in magazines, and sent an SMS would believe that they were paying Monster for the service, even if it be by the agency of the telecommunications network. As part of that arrangement, Monster entered into contracts which entitled the telecommunications network to retain a certain part of the price Monster advertised for the sale of the download. Nonetheless, that arrangement between Monster and the telecommunications network does not change the fundamental character of the advertised price from being the retail price. 71 The use of the concept of agency to overcome the need for privity is a technique which was described in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 193 [79] by Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ adopting the words of Lord Bingham of Cornhill (in Homburg Houtimport BV v Agrosin Private Ltd [2003] UKHL 12 ; [2004] 1 AC 715 at 744) as 'a deft and commercially-inspired response to technical English rules of contract, particularly those governing privity and consideration'. As their Honours went on to note in the case of a stevedore seeking the benefit of a Himalaya clause against a consignee of damaged cargo, courts have been ready to conclude that the carrier was acting with the stevedore's authority. As Lord Wilberforce said in his classic opinion in New Zealand Shipping Co Ltd v AM Satterthwaite & Co Ltd [1975] AC 154 at 167E, the law of contract takes a practical approach in commercial situations '... often at the cost of forcing the facts to fit uneasily into the slots of offer, acceptance and consideration'. Even if Monster be correct to say that at the end of the day it received a lesser sum than that which the customer paid for the download, that was a result of Monster entering into arrangements with the telecommunications networks, perhaps on behalf of the customer or perhaps on its own behalf, it matters not, for the purposes of ensuring that the customer bought the download at the overall price Monster advertised that it was charging. 72 For these reasons, I am of opinion that 'retail price' has its ordinary and natural meaning, namely the price at which Monster advertised the downloads for sale. QUESTION 2: DID APRA AND AMCOS VALIDLY TERMINATE THE SMS LICENCES ON 12 DECEMBER 2005? 73 During the whole of the period in which the SMS licences operated Monster never complied with its obligation, in Schedule 2, to supply within 30 days after the end of each quarter, each APRA and AMCOS with copies of its actual revenue statements from its telecommunications service provider. 74 On 2 September 2005 Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to CG Gillis & Co referring to requests from APRA and AMCOS that Monster provide its revenue and music use information for the quarters ending 31 December 2004, 31 March 2005 and 30 June 2006. Nothing had been provided previously. 75 I am of opinion that APRA and AMCOS were entitled to terminate and validly terminated each of the SMS licences on 12 December 2005 because no actual revenue statement of Monster's telecommunications carrier or service provider for its SMS services referred to in schedule 2 to each SMS licence had been supplied by Monster. 76 Moreover, as I have found above, Monster had not provided APRA and AMCOS with the draft EDI format information, contrary to the requirements specified in the email of 4 March 2005. I am satisfied that this was a breach of cl 5 of the APRA and cl 6 of the AMCOS SMS licences. 77 Monster pointed out that there was an apparent anomaly in the SMS licences. They provided that the licensee must within 14 days after the end of each quarter provide (e.g. ) APRA with the revenue and music information described in Schedule 2 'in the form prescribed by APRA from time to time'. However, Schedule 2 provides that while 8 particular items had to be provided within 14 days, the copies of the actual revenue statements of the telecommunications carriers and service providers and others had to be provided within 30 days. Reading the licences as a whole, I am of opinion that the licensee's obligation in relation to those revenue statements in Schedule 2 and cl 5 of the APRA (or cl 6 of the AMCOS) SMS licences should be read as allowing the licensee 30 days to provide those revenue statements as specifically referred to in Schedule 2. 78 Next, Monster argued that if APRA and AMCOS had not prescribed a form, no obligation arose under either of the respective cll 5 or 6. That obviously is correct. But, for the reasons I have already given, I am of opinion that the form was sufficiently prescribed by either Mr Mallett's conversation with Mr Chong in February or March 2005 and or by the email of 4 March 2005. Monster submitted that the demand of Banki Haddock Fiora to CG Gillis & Co made on 2 September 2005 for revenue and music use information did not refer to the form prescribed. In my opinion that was not necessary. I find that a form had been prescribed for the provision of the information by Mr Mallett saying that Telstra statements and Monster's sales records could be given. Mr Mallett's reference to Telstra would have been understood by Mr Chong to relate to whatever entity was Monster's telecommunications service provider for each of the IVR and SMS services. APRA and AMCOS had performed their contractual obligation. Monster was entitled to present them with information in any particular compilation which met the form Mr Mallett described in the conversation. 79 Monster also argued that because no password was given to it, APRA and AMCOS had not prescribed the form. I am of opinion that that argument has no substance. The absence of the password did not prevent Monster from supplying the information in the format required. It would be APRA's and AMCOS' problem that there was no password. Monster never sought a password or raised this issue as a difficulty. Leaving aside any implied duty of parties to a contract to co-operate, it seems to me that there was no necessity for a password to be provided to enable Monster to comply with its contractual obligations. 80 The difficulty suggested by Monster that it was necessary to know whether the material had to be provided in a document or in a particular electronic format, in my opinion, is of no moment. If I am wrong in my view that the email of 4 March 2005 and Mr Mallett's earlier conversation with Mr Chong were specifications for the purposes of the licences, if APRA and AMCOS left open the way in which the information could be supplied, by requiring only that they have particular pieces of information, Monster was free to select whatever means fell within that description with which to discharge its obligation to provide the relevant material. By reference to the items set out in Schedule 2, Monster would be able to know what sales information had to be included. It was free to select the particular arrangement and presentation of that material in any way it chose. APRA and AMCOS could not complain that it did so. It could not cause Monster inconvenience to supply such information. 81 Next, Monster argued that in some way the communications of 20 January 2005 concerning the draft EDI specification and the fact that the email of 4 March 2005 resent the draft EDI specification led to the result that the 4 March 2005 specification could be ignored by Monster. It also relied on Mr Mallett's evidence that there was no prescribed format as at January, February or March 2005 (T 101.27-.29). That statement cannot override the legal effect of the 4 March 2005 email which was not the subject of discussions between the parties. At best it may reflect Mr Mallett's lay understanding. I reject that argument. The communications in January 2005 were made in a context in which the parties were negotiating draft licence agreements. By 4 March 2005 the licences had been entered into and contractual obligations then existed between the parties. The 4 March 2005 email required implementation or a response. None was given by Monster. 82 I am satisfied that Monster had no bona fide reason for failing to provide the information required. As I have explained above, the conversation between Mr Mallett and Mr Chong which occurred between 11 February and the 4 March 2005 email prescribed a form and format. Even if Mr Mallett, in giving evidence, may not have understood the legal effect of what he had said and APRA and AMCOS had done, I find that there is no evidence that he communicated to Monster or Mr Chong his understanding after the email of 4 March 2005 was sent. In Mr Mallett's earlier conversation with Mr Chong, he was seeking to get the relevant information. He told Mr Chong how to provide it. And the email of 4 March 2005 also specified what would suffice. That was prescription enough. APRA and AMCOS did not suggest or give encouragement to Monster that it delay providing the information. 83 At the time the contracts were entered into both parties knew that there was no prescribed form in the sense of a document with mandatory fields for the provision of the required information. But they also knew that the draft EDI specification identified, as the 4 March 2005 email said, each mandatory field for which Monster was required to provide information. That sufficed to make it a form prescribed by and a format acceptable to APRA and AMCOS. QUESTION 3: WHAT IS THE PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF THE EXPRESSION 'NET CALL REVENUE' OR 'NCR' IN THE IVR LICENCES? 84 Clearly enough, the means of a customer ordering and paying for the download of a Monster ringtone or other service involved a number of interrelating relationships between Monster, the telecommunication companies and its own supplier of telecommunication services Telstra on the one hand, and the customer on the other. Monster advertised that a IVR service would cost, say, $3.96 per minute. A customer who telephoned and placed an order accepted liability for that charge in return for the service of receiving, among other things, the download. But the relationships were far more complex, as the definition of gross call revenue recognised, although few customers would have appreciated this themselves. First, the customer's telecommunication service provider's network would be used to collect from the customer the charge of $3.96. The telecommunication service provider may or may not have been Telstra. That service provider would have had to pay Telstra or Telstra would have had to account for that money internally. Needless to say, each telecommunication service provider participating in this arrangement would be expected to take some part of the $3.96 per minute fee for itself. Then, pursuant to the contract between Telstra and Monster, Telstra had to account for an agreed sum to Monster. 85 It is clear that the commercial purpose behind the definition of gross call revenue was to capture the fact that the customer of Monster would be paying more than ultimately would be made available to Monster after it had passed through the complex of telecommunication company service providers. Next, net call revenue was to be calculated by making 2 deductions about which the parties disagree. 86 The first issue is this. When the definition of net call revenue referred to deducting 'bad debts actually written off' the parties recognised that some allowance needed to be made to take account of the difference between the revenue which accrued from customers making orders and those customers who, in due course, would not pay for those services. Monster contends that this phrase should be construed as requiring a calculation in each quarter that identifies every defaulting customer to the telecommunications suppliers which must then be deducted from the gross call revenues. On the other hand, APRA and AMCOS point to the fact that in Monster's contract with Telstra an allowance or provision of 5% for bad debts is made in each account Telstra sends. Mr Mallett's evidence was that all other licensees have similar arrangements with their telecommunications provider. In the other licensees' returns to APRA and AMCOS they deduct the contractual allowance or provision percentage for bad debts in their contracts with their telecommunications supplier. Again, it is common ground that if Telstra ultimately made an adjustment to the amount of bad debts the subject of the 5% provision in each bill, that adjustment could be reflected in a calculation of net call revenue at the time it was made. 87 The effect of Monster's construction of the requirement to calculate net call revenue has to be considered in the commercial context in which the parties were dealing. Mr Mallett said that the industry reported bad debts written off by applying, universally in his experience, the bad debt provision charged in the telecommunication services provider agreement with the licensee, in the matter in which it is sought by APRA and AMCOS to apply the 5% provision actually charged by Telstra on Monster's telephone services. 88 Mr Mallett said that APRA and AMCOS had never had a licensee who had sought to have a later adjustment, based on actual bad debts, made to the contractual percentage figure used as a provision for bad debts by the telecommunication service providers and licensees. He said that the amount of the provision might vary from licensee to licensee and from month to month for licensees. He said that it was a rolling provision and that it provided the best way of calculating the sum. And so far as Mr Mallett was aware neither APRA or AMCOS had ever been provided with a figure other than the contractual provision (T87.1-.42). But he said that if the actual experience were different to the amount of the provision, then there might be an adjustment further down the track (T86.45-87.15). 89 The use of the provision in the telecommunication service providers contract, which is actually the subject of a payment or an actual deduction from the revenue of the licensee by the provider, makes good business and commercial commonsense. Moreover, it appears, from Mr Mallett's evidence, to be the practice in the industry. After all, he was the person who was responsible within APRA and AMCOS for dealing with these issues from time to time. I accept his evidence. 90 A consequence of Monster's argument is that no deduction should be made from gross call revenue for the 'provision' being the actual money deducted from Monster's receipts by Telstra. Rather, Monster says that the net call revenue should be increased, hence increasing the quantum of its prima facie liability for licence fees, by adding back the 5% provision. Monster would then be assessed for royalty on the false basis that it had received money in fact when Telstra had retained it Monster would thus pay royalty on money it did not receive. Unless and until Telstra ultimately provided some definitive calculation of the actual adjustment, Monster would be out of pocket. That would postpone contractual certainty as to what was due and payable as a licence fee for, perhaps over 12 months until, for tax or other purposes, a decision was made by Telstra and possibly Monster, to write off particular debts. And, Monster's construction involves difficulty of calculation and inconvenience which again suggests that it is not likely that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have adopted it as against the one which in my opinion is appropriate. 91 I am of opinion that the proper construction of the expression 'bad debts actually written off' in the definition of net call revenue is the sum for bad debts which Monster was required to pay to Telstra under its contract as and when Telstra issued bills for that amount. There is no doubt that Telstra actually reduced the amount of the money it paid to Monster pursuant to its contract by the amount of 5% in accordance with the bad debt write off provision. That being so, Monster actually incurred and paid to Telstra that 5% for bad debts. 92 Like all provisions in accounts, bad debts having been provided for they reduced the amount of profit or revenue in the period of account. But in the way in which Monster's contract with Telstra actually worked, Monster paid cash (by receiving 5% less) when Telstra accounted to it. Because it was in the nature of a provision, the bad debt payment was capable of being reversed when, perhaps happily, the debtor paid even though at the time of the original write off, it was not expected that such a result would occur. Telstra had bargained with Monster for the provision of its services subject to the 5% deduction from every payment Telstra made for the supply of the ringtones and other downloads which Monster had sold to consumers. Telstra was, in effect, a collection agency for Monster entitled to take its own share of revenues and bearing some risk as to uncollectible debts from Monster's end customers (hence the concept of gross call revenue to which I have referred). 93 The second disputed question of construction is the meaning of the words 'the connection fee actually charged by the telecommunication service provider responsible for providing the carriage of the IVR service'. It is common ground that Telstra retained 15cents per call for every IVR service and that this sum should be deducted in the calculation of gross call revenue. APRA and AMCOS say that that 15cents charge was within the definition of the connection fee so as to be a deduction from gross call revenue to produce net call revenue. Mr Mallett said that APRA and AMCOS calculated gross call revenue after deducting the 15cents (T 85.16-.35). 94 Monster contends that there are four further sums which fall within the definition of a connection fee. Each of those is found in the schedule of charges in the info [sic] call service provider agreement between Telstra and Monster. 95 The first two are against the marginal heading 'Connection Charge'. They are the new info call service provider establishment charge of $1,000 and the cost of $50 per number for the allocation of each new info call plus number. The info call numbers were the 1900 numbers. I am of opinion that charges to establish the telephony service through which the business is conducted which are described in the agreement itself as connection charges within are the ordinary and natural meaning of the words 'connection fee actually charged' in Schedule 1 of the IVR licences. Accordingly, I find that each of the amount of $1,000 as an establishment charge and the $50 per number for each 1900 number used by Monster was a connection fee actually charged by Telstra to Monster and should be deducted from gross call revenue to calculate net call revenue. 96 The third item which Monster argued falls within the meaning of connection fee in Schedule 1 is the call the charge of $0.003 per second for an info call service excluding the first 24 seconds. Of its nature this charge could only be incurred 24 seconds after a connection was made. Connection of a call to Telstra's service thus was not a consequence of and did not depend upon the payment of this charge. It was simply payable after a certain time elapsed (24 seconds) for the duration of the subsequent part of the telephone call. I do not consider this to be within the ordinary and natural meaning of a connection fee. The call would be free of this charge if it lasted for less than 24 seconds. 97 The fourth item which Monster said should be included as a 'connection fee' was described in its written submissions as 'non-telecommunications service charges, calculated according to a scale of average monthly gross revenue for a 3 month period'. This referred to charges which the info call service provider agreement described as including Telstra's expenses for billing, marketing and administration. These charges are not within the meaning of a 'connection fee'. Their nature is accurately described as 'non-telecommunications service charges' --- that is, as a charge for services outside telephony connection. 98 Had the parties intended that charges of the latter kind should be excluded from net call revenue, it would have been easy to do so by leaving out the word 'connection' from the description of the amount to be deducted. Then all the telecommunications service provider's fees actually charged would be excluded from net call revenue. General fees payable to the providers for their overall services in relation to provision of telephony services are not within the meaning of 'the connection fee actually charged'. 99 The commercial context in which APRA's and AMCOS' IVR licences operated was one in which the consumer was being charged by Telstra (or other telecommunications service provider) on a time basis for IVR calls. The charge was at a rate advertised by Monster in connection with the pricing of the download services Monster was offering to customers. Moreover, it was known to both parties at the time the licences were entered into that there were connection charges which were readily identifiable and easy of calculation. They were the 15cents per call or like fee charged by the telecommunications provider directly to the customer (which it is common ground should not be included in net call revenue) and what the telecommunications carrier said was such a fee. 100 Monster's expert accounting witness, Mr Peter White, was a partner of Bentleys MRI Sydney. He was instructed to use Monster's construction of 'connection fee actually charged' in calculating the net call revenue. He said that to calculate the actual net call revenue for the 3 years ended 30 June 2006 using this construction would involve in excess of 10,000 calculations and he had not had time to do that exercise. More revealing was his observation that it was not possible to calculate that net call revenue '... as it is unclear what charges have been made by Telstra'. 101 Mr White's evidence showed that if net call revenue were to be calculated so as to take account of the third and fourth items suggested by Monster, the exercise would be commercially and practically highly inconvenient if not impossible. 102 The words 'connection fee' were used in the commercial context of a telecommunications service provider's fees for IVR services for the purpose of retaining, all revenue on which royalty was chargeable gained from end customers that both the licensee and its telecommunication service provider earned from selling the downloads on a time cost for the phone call to the end customer except for two items. The first, bad debts actually written off, excluded revenue not received by the licensee. The second exclusion was what the telecommunications service provider was entitled to retain as, in effect, flag fall charges to Monster and the end customer for establishing the connection by which it and the licensee then earned revenue from the duration of the call. It would be contrary to the purpose of the IVR licences to exclude as a 'connection fee' any portion of the time based earnings of the licensee and its telecommunications service provider derived from the exploitation of the copyright works. Moreover, the complexity and difficulty of calculating Monster's last two suggested deductions tells against an objective intention that they be included in the concept of a 'connection fee'. 103 In my opinion Monster's construction would lead to a result contrary to common sense (cf: Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36 ; (1996) 186 CLR 389 at 400 citing Oliver LJ in Exxon Corporation v Exxon Insurance Ltd [1982] Ch 119 at 144 where recourse to commonsense in construing an expression in a statute was allowed). A similar approach is apposite in construing agreements: cp: Miramar Maritime Corporation v Holborn Oil Trading Ltd [1984] AC 676 at 682E-F per Lord Diplock). As Lord Diplock said in Antaios Compania Naviera SA v Salen Rederierna AB [1985] AC 191 at 201E: '... if detailed semantic and syntactical analysis of words in a commercial contract is going to lead to a conclusion that flouts business commonsense, it must be made to yield to business commonsense'. 104 Lord Reid once said that in arriving at the proper construction of a contract: 'The fact that a particular construction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The more unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended it, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall make that intention abundantly clear: L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 at 251E. ' 105 Monster submitted that this was not an available approach to construction and that I was bound to follow what it argued was the different approach in Fitzgerald v Masters [1956] HCA 53 ; (1956) 95 CLR 420. In that case, of course, there was an obvious mistake. The question was how should the Court construe the language used. McTiernan, Webb and Taylor JJ said (95 CLR at 437): 'It is trite law that an instrument must be construed as a whole. Indeed it is the only method by which inconsistencies of expression may be reconciled and it is in this natural and commonsense approach to problems of construction that justification is to be found for the rejection of repugnant words, the transposition of words and the supplying of omitted words (cf. Norton on Deeds 2 nd ed (1928) p 98)' (emphasis added) 106 Their Honours' approach is not inconsistent with Lord Reid's or Lord Diplock's approaches. After all, the purpose of construction of contracts is to ascertain by reference to the words used in the factual matrix in which the parties dealt with one another what an objective person would reasonably understand the parties to have intended. And, as Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council [2002] HCA 5 ; (2002) 76 ALJR 436 at 439 [10] ; [2002] HCA 5 ; 186 ALR 289 at 293: ' [10] In Codelfa , Mason J (with whose judgment Stephen J and Wilson J agreed) referred to authorities (In particular, speeches of Lord Wilberforce in Prenn v Simmonds [1971] 1 WLR 1381 at 1381-1383-1385; [1971] 3 All ER 237 at 239-241; L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd [1973] UKHL 2 ; [1974] AC 235 at 261; and Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-997; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574-576) which indicated that, even in respect of agreements under seal, it is appropriate to have regard to more than internal linguistic considerations and to consider the circumstances with reference to which the words in question were used and, from those circumstances, to discern the objective which the parties had in view. In particular, an appreciation of the commercial purpose of a contract: ( Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Yngvar Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-996; [1976] 3 All ER 570 at 574) \"... presupposes knowledge of the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties are operating. \" Such statements exemplify the point made by Brennan J in his judgment in Codelfa: ((1982) [1982] HCA 24 ; 149 CLR 337 at 401) \"The meaning of a written contract may be illuminated by evidence of facts to which the writing refers, for the symbols of language convey meaning according to the circumstances in which they are used. \"' 107 Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Maggbury Pty Limited v Hafele Australia Pty Limited [2001] HCA 70 ; (2001) 210 CLR 181 at 188: 'Interpretation of a written contract involves, as Lord Hoffmann has put it ( Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society [1997] UKHL 28 ; [1998] 1 WLR 896 at 912; [1997] UKHL 28 ; [1998] 1 All ER 98 at 114. See also the remarks of Mason J in Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority (NSW) [1982] HCA 24 ; (1982) 149 CLR 337 at 350-352, and of Lord Bingham of Cornhill in Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali [2001] UKHL 8 ; [2002] 1 AC 251 at 259): \"the ascertainment of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contract. \" That knowledge may include matters of law, as in this case where the obtaining of intellectual property protection was of central importance to the commercial development of Mr Allen's ironing board (cf Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA v Ali [2001] UKHL 8 ; [2002] 1 AC 251 at 282, per Lord Clyde). ' 108 It is necessary to construe an agreement so as to avoid making it commercial nonsense or working commercial inconvenience. The commercial purpose of the definitions, that is to say the purpose of a reasonable person in the position of the parties to the contract, is relevant. That in turn requires attention to the genesis of the transaction, the background, the context, the market in which the parties were operating, as known to both parties: Zhu v Treasurer of New South Wales [2004] HCA 56 ; (2004) 218 CLR 530 at 559 [82] . 109 Accordingly, the $0.003 per second and non-telecommunications service charges should not be deducted from net call revenue. QUESTION 4: DID APRA AND AMCOS VALIDLY TERMINATE THE IVR LICENCES ON 17 AUGUST 2005? 110 APRA and AMCOS say they were entitled to terminate the IVR licences because the interim fees invoiced after the audit were not paid within 14 days. By cll 6.2 and 6.3 of the APRA IVR licence (cll 7.2 and 7.3 of the AMCOS one) Monster had to pay any invoice issued by the licensor within 14 days after the date of the invoice. An invoice for additional licence fees issued after APRA received information under cl 8 (cl 9 of the AMCOS IVR licence) had also to be paid within this time (cll 6.3 and 7.3 respectively). 111 On 30 May 2005 APRA and AMCOS served Monster with interim invoices which had been raised following the audit. The letter to Mr Chong and Monster enclosing the interim invoices said that APRA and AMCOS had calculated a minimum amount payable under the IVR licences based on the information provided to the auditors by Monster. The interim invoices were said to be 'not for the full amount that APRA/AMCOS will be claiming under the agreements. By issuing the enclosed invoices we in no way waive of our rights to claim the full amount of licence fees owing'. 112 On 22 July 2005 Banki Haddock Fiora wrote to CG Gillis & Co demanding full payment of the 30 May licence fee invoices by 29 July 2005. Although the letter did not nominate the clauses of each IVR licence dealing with termination, it did say that if Monster failed to comply with the demand APRA and AMCOS would have no hesitation in enforcing their respective rights. 113 On 17 August 2005 Bank Haddock Fiora wrote to CG Gillis & Co terminating each IVR agreement pursuant to cl 10.1 of the APRA IVR agreement and cl 11.1 of the AMCOS IVR agreement, on the basis that no payment had been made of either of the interim fees the subject of the audit. Since cl 6.3 of the APRA IVR agreement (cl 7.3 of the AMCOS one) had required the licensee to pay within 14 days after the date of an invoice the full amount of the invoice issued on receipt by APRA of information from an audit under cl 8, Monster was in breach of that obligation by the middle of June 2005. The letter of 22 July 2005 to Monster's solicitors made clear that the breach needed to be remedied within 7 days. It was not. That enlivened the powers of APRA and AMCOS to terminate each licence. 114 Under the IVR licences, Schedule 2 is in a different form to its counterpart in the SMS licence. Items (i) and (j) are additional in the IVR licences. In the IVR licences the licensee had to provide within 14 days of the end of each quarter a statement or statements from Telstra detailing gross call revenue and the necessary information to assess net call revenue. The effect of item (j) in Schedule 2 is to make the statement or statements from Telstra, being its account, a document from which gross call revenue may be calculated and will provide the necessary information to assess net call revenue. 115 Monster argued that if APRA and AMCOS did not provide a format, a licensee in the position of Monster would not know how to supply the information to APRA and AMCOS in a form that was acceptable for the purposes of cll 5 and 6 of the respective licences and item (i) of Schedule 2. I have found that Monster was aware of the requirements of APRA and AMCOS from 4 March 2005. Monster argued that it would not know whether to provide the information in documentary form or electronically or if it did in what particular format. I am of opinion that since Mr Chong never complained to Mr Mallett after Mr Mallett told him what APRA and AMCOS would be satisfied with, the parties understood what it was that had to be provided, namely Telstra accounts and the sales information. The sales information could be in the form in which Monster produced it for its internal purposes. Exhibit 1, for example, is a printout of the detail of Monster's computer records of sales. It gave sufficient information needed to analyse the sales, albeit that when the auditors actually analysed that material they discovered the treble download spike. 116 In cross-examination Mr Mallett acknowledged that his calculations, including those for the invoices dated 30 May 2005, invariably used the provision of 5% for bad debts in Monster's info call service provider agreement with Telstra, rather than an exact calculation of the final adjustment for bad debts (T 86.44-87.10). In that context, Monster sought to rely upon Mr Mallett's concession in cross-examination that the invoices of 30 May 2005 had not been calculated strictly in accordance with the formula in Schedule 1 (T 91.40-.44). However, I have found that the method of calculation using the 5% percentage figure did accord with the requirement in Schedule 1 to deduct 'bad debts actually written off'. 117 Monster argued that there had to be, first, a form prescribed under cl 5 of the APRA IVR licence (cl 6 of the AMCOS one) for Monster to have any obligation to provide its revenue and music use information. Next, it argued that any invoice which APRA calculated had to be calculated in accordance with Schedule 1. APRA and AMCOS had relied on the material in Deloitte's audit conducted in May 2005 to calculate the invoices rendered on 30 May 2005. Monster said that if those invoices were not prepared in accordance with Schedule 1, there was no basis on which APRA and AMCOS could terminate the IVR licences. Monster pointed to the fact that it was common ground that in performing the audit Deloitte did not apply Monster's construction in its analysis. Relevantly, on my findings this means that the IVR interim invoices were calculated without deducting any connection fees other than the 15cents per call charge. Thus, Monster argued that the calculations performed by APRA and AMCOS on the basis of the audit report were not undertaken in accordance with cl 4 and Schedule 1. Therefore, it said that the interim invoices were not valid. 118 It follows from my findings that there was a minor error in the way APRA and AMCOS approached the calculation of the IVR licence invoices dated 30 May 2005 because they did not take account of the initial connection fee of $1,000 or the $50 per 1900 number. The invoice adjustment sheet for the two invoices explains how each was calculated. They were arrived at after deducting 5% of gross revenue received by Monster in accordance with the provision in the Telstra info call service provider agreement. That led to a calculation of net call revenue of $8,344,634.82 derived from Telstra's statements for the period from August 2003 to March 2005 inclusive. This represented the total revenue paid by customers less the amount of Telstra's bad debt provision. It did not include the 15cents per call which Telstra had separately debited to the customers and had not shown in its statements. 119 The figure for net call revenue, however, should be reduced by the $1,000 connection fee and $50 per 1900 number connection fee which I have held to be properly deductible from gross revenue. However, those amounts are quite immaterial in the overall total of net call revenue used in the interim fee calculations. Even if there were 100 of the 1900 numbers, that would mean that the net call revenue figure used was overstated by $6,000 (being $1,000 for the connection fee and $5,000 ($50 x 100) for the 1900 numbers) that is a small fraction of 1% of the total of $8.345 million. 120 The adjustment sheet makes assumptions, because the data provided by Monster did not make clear how many downloads represented monophonic and polyphonic ringtones. There was a uniform assumption applied to the whole of the data that 18.44% of all of the downloads Monster provided to its customers were of ringtones on which APRA and AMCOS were entitled to royalties. The AMCOS interim fee was calculated using a factor that 90% of those downloads were works the subject of the AMCOS IVR licence, although AMCOS' analysis indicated that 97% of the items were in that category. The 10% licence fee of $138,487.59 (before GST) actually invoiced thus represented a sum that was substantially smaller than it would have been had the 97% figure been used. 121 A similar adjustment was made in the APRA interim fee of $14,618.13. For that calculation it was assumed 95% of the works for which Monster supplied downloads in the period were covered by the APRA IVR licence. APRA's analysis had indicated that the examination of Monster's records showed that 99% of the relevant items downloaded was a closer approximation. Mr White and the expert accounting witness for APRA and AMCOS, Mr Woodley of Deloitte, agreed that there was nothing to show that the use of the 90% and 95% figures in the calculation in the adjustment sheet for the interim invoices was in error. 122 While cl 4 of the IVR licences required the licensee to pay the licence fee calculated in accordance with the formula in Schedule 1, cl 6.3 of the APRA IVR licence (and cl 7.3 of the AMCOS one) permitted APRA to issue an invoice for any additional licence fees payable on receipt of the audit information. The audit information indicated that Monster's record keeping did not allow precise calculation. Monster argued that the new calculation under cl 6.3 must be mathematically precise. It referred to the obligation under cl 6.1 that APRA was obliged to calculate the licence fee for the quarter in accordance with cl 4 on receipt of information under cl 5 (that is in accordance with the formula in Schedule 1). The information under cl 5 was what Monster was obliged to provide in accordance with Schedule 2 in the form prescribed by APRA. Once an audit had to be conducted, and additional fees became payable, the IVR licences contemplated that some degree of approximation or estimation may be required. The IVR licences recognized that it may not be possible for APRA and AMCOS to be precise, for the very reason that an audit was required. 123 If the licensee failed to keep proper accounts by reference to which fees could be precisely calculated, APRA or AMCOS would have to work on an estimation based on the information from the auditor. And, of course, a licensee could frustrate the issue of any invoices by APRA and AMCOS by failing to provide some or all of the information necessary to make the calculation in Schedule 1 of the IVR licences. That is just what Monster did before APRA and AMCOS exercised their right to have an audit in April 2005. A licensee in Monster's position could hardly rely on its own default in providing, or even recording, accurate information from which mathematical precision was possible ( New Zealand Shipping Company Limited v Societe des Ateliers et Chantiers de France [1919] AC 1; Suttor v Gundowda Pty Limited [1950] HCA 35 ; (1950) 81 CLR 418). 124 Monster made no complaint at the hearing about the estimation processes used in the calculation of the interim invoices. That was a commonsense approach. I am not satisfied that there was any error in the calculation of the two interim invoices. The process involved, necessarily and without complaint by Monster, the need to make estimations. In my opinion any failure to include in the calculations in the interim invoices of 30 May 2005 the two deductions for connection fees which I have found ought to have been included had no effect on the validity of the invoices. The connection fees were for sums which were immaterial to the result. Having regard to the assumptions used by APRA and AMCOS in calculating them, I am not satisfied that the interim invoices overstated the exact amounts which would have been due had precise calculations then been possible. There was no basis upon which Monster could have failed to have paid the interim invoices in accordance with the requirements of each IVR licence within 14 days of their date. 125 I am satisfied that no less than the sum claimed in each interim invoice was owing by Monster to APRA and AMCOS respectively on 30 May 2005. 126 Accordingly, I am of opinion that APRA and AMCOS were entitled to terminate the IVR licences when they did on 17 August 2005. QUESTION 5: WAS THE OFFER OF APRA AND AMCOS MADE ON 28 OCTOBER 2005 TO ENTER INTO NEW IVR LICENCES AND TO SETTLE THE DISPUTE OPEN FOR ACCEPTANCE BY MONSTER AS AT 7 FEBRUARY 2006 AND, IF SO, WAS IT VALIDLY ACCEPTED BY MONSTER ON THAT DATE? 127 Mr Mallett gave instructions for Banki Haddock Fiora's correspondence in late October 2005 in which APRA and AMCOS offered to enter into a resolution of the earlier dispute and to issue new IVR licences to Monster. When the letter from CG Gillis & Co of 7 February 2006 (Ex 2) was received, Mr Mallett's lay understanding was that Monster, by Mr Chong as its managing director, had executed all three forms of agreement which had been sent with Banki Haddock Fiora's letter of 28 October 2005. I am satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have understood the new IVR licences to have been executed by Mr Chong on behalf of Monster. It was the only client on whose behalf CG Gillis & Co appeared to have written on 7 February 2006. 128 Monster argued that the offer of 28 October 2005 was open to be accepted over three months later on 7 February 2006. In general, the law implies that when no time limit for the exercise of a right is stipulated, the right may be exercised within a reasonable time unless there are indications to the contrary: Reid v Moreland Timber Co Pty Limited [1946] HCA 48 ; (1946) 73 CLR 1 at 13 per Dixon J. I am of opinion that this statement of the rule, coming from a case in contract, is just as applicable to a case where an offer to enter into a contract is made. Ordinarily in contract, absent an express provision to the contrary, where no time is fixed for performance, the parties are, or the party upon whom the obligation is cast is, obliged to perform within a reasonable time: see e.g. Perri v Coolangatta Investments Pty Limited [1982] HCA 29 ; (1982) 149 CLR 537 at 545-546 per Gibbs CJ, 567 per Brennan J (with whom Stephen J agreed). And, in Ballas v Theophilos [No 2] [1957] HCA 90 ; (1957) 98 CLR 193 at 197 Dixon CJ (with whom McTiernan J agreed) said that the implication of law, where a partnership deed limited no time for the exercise of an option, is that the option had to be exercised within a reasonable time. Dixon J observed that the stipulations contained in the relevant clause itself affected what a reasonable time was. Williams J, came to a like conclusion (at 98 CLR at 199). 129 At the time the letter of 28 October 2005 was sent, the parties were negotiating to resolve a dispute. Monster needed certainty that it had valid IVR licences. APRA and AMCOS had asserted that their terminations of the IVR licences on 17 August 2005 were valid and that Monster needed the new licences which were being offered. The offer included a proposed agreement, inter alia, to effect a transition from the disputed termination of the IVR licences by the grant of new IVR licences to commence on 18 August 2005. Clause 4.2 of that draft agreement acknowledged that APRA and AMCOS could at any time in the future make further claims for the payment of licence fees due under the terminated IVR licences (Ex 2). 130 Monster claimed that it made the payments of the sums claimed in APRA's and AMCOS' interim invoices of 30 May 2005 in consideration of the grant of new IVR licences. Given that this was money already owing, and at the time Monster had paid nothing under the SMS licences, no consideration can be inferred to have been given by Monster for the grant of new licences. 131 Banki Haddock Fiora's letter of 24 October 2005 to Monster's solicitors enclosing draft documents for execution referred to a conversation on 21 October 2005. Significantly it requested that Monster's solicitors have its client sign and return both sets of agreements as soon as possible to Monster. And then Banki Haddock Fiora would have their client sign them and return one set. Monster's solicitors responded on 27 October 2005 seeking amendments to be made. The response on 28 October 2005 was immediate that the amendments were accepted. So, at that time both parties knew of the dispute, the potential for uncertainty and of the existence of an offer to resolve the dispute on terms which, on 28 October 2005, appeared to be acceptable to each of them. No impediment to immediate execution of the draft documents was apparent. There was no reason why either side, or a reasonable person in the position of the parties, would think that any lengthy time to respond to the offer in the letter of 28 October 2005 was needed. Indeed, the letter of 24 October 2005 had asked Monster's solicitors to return all the signed agreements 'as soon as possible'. That requirement for timeous signature and return would have been understood by a reasonable person in the position of the parties to have remained a part of APRA's and AMCOS' renewed offer of 28 October 2005 even though it sought the documents 'in due course'. 'Due course', in the context, conveyed timeousness rather than open endedness. 132 After that, in the intervening three months to 7 February 2006, new and significant disputes emerged between Monster and its actual or putative IVR licensors. Certainly when APRA and AMCOS terminated the SMS licences on 12 December 2005 a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have perceived that APRA and AMCOS were no longer prepared to enter into new contracts with Monster. APRA and AMCOS point to the additional feature reinforcing such a conclusion that the IVR licences themselves involved dealing with large numbers of works and substantial sums of money, in a context where Monster, in the intervening period, had failed to execute the offered documents so as to evince a position of being contractually bound. Between 16 October 2005 and 20 January 2006 it had not paid any royalties at all to APRA and AMCOS. During this period Monster was not providing accounting material under the SMS licences or the IVR licences (which Monster was asserting had not been terminated). 133 Indeed, in late January 2006 the parties were negotiating a different and inconsistent offer being put forward by APRA and AMCOS (Ex 2). At a conference between the parties and their solicitors on 31 January 2006, APRA and AMCOS announced that they would accept $450,000 in full and final settlement of any unpaid royalties due during the period the subject of the audit and, failing payment, they would commence proceedings claiming breach of copyright, damages and costs. This was clearly an ultimatum. It was also a new and obviously significantly different offer to that put on 28 October 2005. In its solicitors' letter of 7 February 2006 Monster replied to that offer, refusing it. They sought more time and returned the executed IVR licences to take effect on 18 August 2005. Monster then asserted that it did not believe that it owed any money for the audit period covered by Deloitte's May 2005 report. Monster also asserted that the one week which APRA and AMCOS were prepared to allow it to investigate the new claim for $450,000 was an unreasonably short time. 134 The rights and liabilities of the parties to a contract are determined by a reference to what each party by words or conduct would have led a reasonable person in the position of the other party to believe ( Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 179 [40] ). I am of opinion that the same principle should be applied to the evaluation of whether an offer, the acceptance of which would bring the parties into an actual contractual relationship, is capable of acceptance. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have regarded the offer of 28 October 2005 as not remaining open for an indefinite time. Such a person would have said on 7 February 2006 that the offer of 28 October 2006 had lapsed some considerable time before. 135 For these reasons, I am of opinion that the offer made on 28 October 2005 was no longer open for acceptance when the SMS licences were terminated on 12 December 2005. A reasonable person in the position of the parties would have considered that, if the offer had been open before the termination of the SMS licences, that event indicated that the offer could not be accepted thereafter. If I am wrong in that view, I am of opinion that a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have had no doubt that the offer made in late October 2005 was no longer on foot at the time of the meeting of 31 January 2006 and was therefore incapable of acceptance thereafter. WERE APRA AND AMCOS ESTOPPED FROM REFUSING TO GRANT NEW IVR LICENCES? 136 Monster's case for estoppel was based on the negotiations in September and October 2005 in which APRA and AMCOS indicated that they would be prepared to grant new IVR licences effective from 18 August 2005. Monster argued that at no stage did APRA or AMCOS seek to disabuse it from its assumption that those new licence agreements would be granted until Haddock Banki Fiora's letter of 8 February 2006 suggested to the contrary. It argued that APRA's and AMCOS' conduct prior to that time 'was consistent only with the proposition that new IVR licences would be granted. If their position had changed after October 2005, then it argued that it was incumbent, upon them to inform Monster of that change. Instead, Monster carried on its business, secure, so it said, in the knowledge that new IVR licences would be granted. 137 Monster then argued that it would be unconscionable for APRA and AMCOS to resile from that representation. Monster conceded that its argument for estoppel was weaker than its argument that it had new IVR licences based on the 7 February 2006 purported acceptance. Accordingly, Monster conceded that if it failed to succeed on its case in contract, its case for estoppel could not succeed. The concession was in my opinion correctly made. I am of opinion that this argument has no substance for the reasons that I have given above. 138 There was no objective basis on which Monster could have believed that new IVR licences would be granted. It chose for reasons it left unexplained not to return for over 3 months the executed IVR licences and agreement sent to its solicitors on 28 October 2005. APRA and AMCOS did nothing to encourage or condone this inactivity. Rather, Monster's inaction was quite consistent with its commercial behaviour, as demonstrated during Mr Chong's cross-examination, of deliberately exploiting other persons' copyright material without accounting for royalties or having a legal right to do so for as long as the owners did not take action against Monster for so acting. 139 I am not satisfied that Mr Chong had any belief, after the SMS licences were terminated on 12 December 2005, that APRA and AMCOS would grant Monster new IVR licences effective from 18 August 2005. Mr Chong was, to my observation, far too astute to have any such belief. He chose not to return, for over 3 months, the new proposed IVR licences executed by Monster which would have given certainty. I do not believe that he, as the controlling mind of Monster, thought for a moment that APRA and AMCOS were, in effect, representing that the termination of the old IVR licences and the grant of new ones was a formality and was being held open indefinitely. DID APRA AND AMCOS ENGAGE IN UNCONSCIONABLE CONDUCT? 140 Monster argued that if there were no presently subsisting licence from APRA or AMCOS, it would be unconscionable for them, and thereby a contravention by them of s 51AC of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), to refuse to grant licences to Monster on standard terms and conditions. Under s 51AC(1) a corporation, such as APRA and AMCOS, is prohibited from engaging in conduct in trade or commerce, in connection with the supply or possible supply of services to a person or corporation, such as Monster, that is, in all the circumstances, unconscionable. Monster argued that APRA and AMCOS' refusal to grant the licences to it would contravene s 51AC(1). It referred to the non-exclusive specified considerations in s 51AC(3). 141 In Australian Securities and Investments Commission v National Exchange Pty Ltd [2005] FCAFC 226 ; (2005) 148 FCR 132 at 142-143 [43] - [44] Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ said that the primary emphasis of an analogue of s 51AC was on the conduct of the person in the position of the supplier of the services. They said that the law was not, of course, intended to protect the reckless or the unreasonable and approved a statement by Spigelman CJ in Attorney-General of New South Wales v World Best Holdings Ltd [2005] NSWCA 261 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 557 at 583 [121] that '[u]nconscionability is a concept which requires a high level of moral obloquy'. 142 No extrinsic material was put before me by the parties as to the statutory meaning of 'unconscionable' in s 51AC. However, Tamberlin, Finn and Conti JJ referred to the second reading speech introducing s 51AC into the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth). They identified that its purpose was to better protect the legal rights of small business and to ensure that small business could confidently deal with large firms. They said that the concern of the Parliament was that there should be improved enforcement rights and access to remedies for small business (148 FCR at 143 [48]-[49]). Earlier their Honours had said that the question posed by a claim under s 51AC was whether the conduct complained of was 'unconscionable' according to the ordinary and natural meaning of that term, having regard to the list of statutory considerations. 143 Monster submitted that for conduct to be regarded as unconscionable, serious misconduct or something clearly unfair or unreasonable had to be demonstrated. It said that the factors which were of particular relevance in this case arose under s 51AC(3)(a) , (j) and (k). Monster pointed to the relative strengths of the bargaining positions of AMCOS and APRA as effective monopolists of copyright material in respect of or the power to grant licences for the performance in public throughout Australia. It argued that it was not practically possible for Monster to carry on business in Australia involving the provision of ringtones to telephone users without a licence from APRA and AMCOS to communicate to the public the works in their repertories. Monster alleged that contrary to s 51AC(3)(j) , APRA and AMCOS are not willing to negotiate terms and conditions of a contract for the supply of services with it and that they did not act in good faith (s 51AC (3)(k)) (RCWS 89 ). 144 In Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 the High Court considered the incorporation into s 51AA of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) the concept of unconscionability in the unwritten law. While s 51AC is a separate and freestanding statutory provision, the word 'unconscionable' is undefined in both s 51AA and s 51AC. The latter section identifies a range of factors to which the Court may have regard in considering whether in all the circumstances the relevant conduct is unconscionable. The factors identified in s 51AC(3) are, of course, not exhaustive, but they have similarities to the features of unconscionability or unconscientious behaviour identified in decisions of Blomley v Ryan [1954] HCA 79 ; (1956) 99 CLR 362 and Commercial Bank of Australia Ltd v Amadio [1983] HCA 14 ; (1983) 151 CLR 447. In ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 at 64 [11] Gleeson CJ observed that a person was not in a position of relevant disadvantage simply because of inequality of bargaining powers. He said that many, perhaps even most, contracts are made between parties of unequal bargaining power, and good conscience does not require parties to contractual negotiations to forfeit their advantages, or neglect their own interests. And the Chief Justice continued that unconscientious exploitation or another's inability, or diminished ability, to conserve his or her own interests is not to be confused with taking advantage of a superior bargaining position for the purposes of s 51AA (214 CLR at 64 [14]). 145 However, a difference in bargaining positions is a factor which is one of the relevant circumstances that can be taken into account under s 51AC(3)(a). In ACCC v CG Berbatis Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 18 ; (2003) 214 CLR 51 at 65 [15] - [16] , Gleeson CJ pointed out that the critical disadvantage from which the lessees in that case suffered was that they had no legal entitlement to a renewal or extension of the lease; that depended upon the lessors' willingness to grant such rights. In that context there was a compulsion to deal with the lessors which created a distinct disadvantage on the lessees, but not such as to attract the unwritten law of unconscionability to their position. As Gleeson CJ said: 'It is an everyday occurrence in negotiations for settlement of legal disputes that, as a term of settlement, one party will be required to abandon claims which may or may not be related to the principal matter in issue. ' He said that parties to commercial negotiations frequently use their bargaining power to 'extract' concessions from other parties but that was the stuff of ordinary commercial dealings (see too per Gummow and Hayne JJ at 214 CLR at 76-77 [55]-[57] and Callinan J at 112-115 [172]-[185]). 146 Monster gave no explanation for its failure to accept the offer of new IVR licences in the period following 28 October 2005. Nor did it identify any conduct of APRA and AMCOS as being unconscionable while Monster did not reply to the 28 October 2005 letter. Monster saw its own interests were served by it not pursuing that matter. That only changed on 31 January 2006 when APRA and AMCOS made a threat to commence proceedings if Monster did not pay what they said was due by 8 February, the day after the letter of 7 February 2006 was sent. 147 I do not see any element of unconscientiousness or moral obloquy on the part of APRA and AMCOS in this situation. Monster was advised by solicitors. Mr Chong was well able to make commercial decisions in what he saw as being Monster's and his own best interests. For Monster's and his own reasons, about which he gave no evidence, he chose not to take up the offer of new IVR licences at a time when it was obvious APRA and AMCOS were prepared to grant them in late October 2005. And, because Monster had no licences, and was not continuing to trade without them, APRA and AMCOS were entitled to act as they did in seeking to enforce their rights to prevent infringement of copyrights in which they were interested. 148 I am of opinion that after 12 December 2005, not only did Monster have no IVR or SMS licences with APRA or AMCOS, it did not believe it had them either. QUESTION 6: IS MONSTER ENTITLED TO AN ORDER THAT APRA AND AMCOS GRANT IT AN IVR LICENCES OR ITS EQUIVALENT? 149 I am of opinion that no such order should be made. Monster has committed serious breaches of the IVR and SMS licences in the past. I do not think that it is appropriate to force APRA and AMCOS into a contractual relationship in the circumstances. I am not satisfied that they would not negotiate the granting of new licences to Monster in good faith. If Monster cannot obtain in such negotiations new licences from APRA, the Copyright Tribunal has power to settle their terms. That power may also extend to the AMCOS licences in circumstances such as the present: Re Powercom Interactive Media Pty Ltd (2003) 175 FLR at 8-9 [26]-[31] per Lindgren P. QUESTION 7: WHAT IS THE QUANTUM OF LICENCE FEES PAYABLE BY MONSTER FOR SALES OF RINGTONES OR, APRA AND AMCOS HAVING ELECTED TO SUE FOR DAMAGES, THE DAMAGES PAYABLE FOR THE INFRINGEMENTS WHICH OCCURRED BY SALES AT SUCH TIMES AS MONSTER WAS NOT LICENSED? 150 Monster was unlicensed from 18 August 2005 in respect of IVR services and from 13 December in respect of SMS services. It is liable to APRA and AMCOS for damages for infringement. APRA and AMCOS exercised their election to claim damages rather than an account of profits. It is agreed that the appropriate sum by which compensatory damages should be fixed is what would have been payable under the licences had Monster been licensed. That is a reasonable approach and I will adopt it. 151 Mr Mallett identified four licensees of ringtones from APRA and AMCOS which he said were comparable to the business operated by Monster. The trading names of the licensees were Jamster, Bugal, Blue Sky Frog and Powercom. He concluded that the proportions of ringtone downloads of all downloads in each of those competitors' businesses over the periods he examined were between 40.94% and 66.17%. This was based on the amount of licence fees paid to APRA and AMCOS by each of those licensees during the relevant licence periods. Mr Mallett estimated, based on his comparison with the four competitors, about 41.31% of Monster's revenue over its period of trading was attributable to ringtone services. This led to a claim that total licence fees due to 30 June 2006 were $1 million of which only about $315,000 had been paid. 152 Mr Mallett agreed that there was no industry norm for the percentage of ringtones as part of the overall business of providers in the download industry. So much is clear from his confidential material analysing the returns and licence fees paid by the four selected comparable licensees. Each of those four was shown to be operating under different business models and using different marketing strategies to Monster. None remained in business throughout the whole of the period under examination. And, since July 2003, there had been two significant changes in the market. First, in late 2004, SMS downloads began to be offered by Monster. Secondly, in about October 2005 MP3 downloads began to be offered by Monster. The introduction of each of those different methods of delivery affected Monster's sales, revenue overall and its IVR business. Once SMS downloads were commercially available, customers used them more often and in preference to IVR downloads. No doubt this is due to the fact that the SMS calls are for a fixed price, whereas the price of IVR calls depends upon the length of time spent on the telephone ordering the relevant download or downloads. 153 Mr Chong identified Jamster's marketing model as having a subscription customer base, which explained why its advertising expenditure dropped in 2006 once that subscription base had been established. Jamster had a 'ringtone club' which allowed subscribers to download ringtones, logos and music news by paying a small sum per month to Jamster. For that reason he did not regard Jamster's business as being comparable to Monster's. He also showed that Bugle's, Blue Sky Frog and Powercom's advertising expenditures had become relatively minimal by 2006 which meant that each of them was not relevantly comparable at the present time. 154 Monster marketed its products exclusively through print media, particularly weekly and monthly magazine publications. Mr Chong said that Monster's most significant expense was advertising. Mr Chong said that each advertisement created a short term demand for the products advertised. He said that Monster had been the fourth largest advertiser in dollar terms in magazines for the providers of mobile downloadable products in the calendar year 2003. In the following year, he said that Monster was the largest advertiser of such products in magazines, but had fallen to second in 2005, behind Jamster. In the six months to June 2006 Monster had again become the largest advertiser in this area. 155 Mr Chong asserted that the introduction of MP3 ringtones created a demand that did not have any substantive impact on the sales of non MP3 ringtones. In other words, he asserted that monophonic and polyphonic ringtone downloads remained a constant 18% of Monster's revenue even after the introduction of the MP3 products which accounted for 14% of Monster's download revenue after October 2005. However, Mr Mallett's analysis and summary of Monster's monthly revenues shows no identifiable changes in its gross revenues for all downloads (including ringtones) until about May 2006 when Monster ceased offering MP3s. 156 Mr Chong explained in his evidence that draft financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2006 reflected a change in the organization of Monster's business. He wanted to segregate the IVR and SMS functions in the business and had split the revenues earned by them. The draft financial statements recorded about $1 million as revenue for Monster's receipts from its IVR business and about $2.75 million of revenue as 'management fees' in respect of the SMS business. The management fee was received from Nomad Systems Pty Limited, a company which Mr Chong wholly owned and controlled. Nomad derived income from SMS sales in the year ended 30 June 2006 and Monster extracted the management fee from Nomad. Mr Chong said that Nomad had an IP platform for potential partners in an SMS business, but Monster did the marketing and advertising for that business. He noted that Nomad had no staff (see Ex K). Mr Chong acknowledged even though these accounts recorded Monster receiving IVR services revenue from Telstra, in fact the revenues were generated under a contract between Telstra and Chucky Communications Pty Limited entered into on 1 May 2005 in substitution for Monster's previous contractual relationship for IVR services with Telstra (see Ex J 'Chunky' is a typographical error for 'Chucky', see transcript). Even though Telstra had contracted with Chucky, it continued to pay the IVR revenues directly into Monster's bank account. Mr Chong said that Monster was the trading business. Mr Chong realised that since September 2005 he had been aware of the desire of APRA and AMCOS to understand the role which Chucky had played in the activities of Mr Chong's businesses and how it could receive revenue from Testra for the sale of IVR services without an IVR licence. 157 The experts' need to indulge in competing hypotheses was caused by Monster's record keeping. They agreed that the triple download spike during the period October 2003 to April 2005 was unlikely to represent actual sales. They said that there was a likelihood that it was caused by a system bug. It was effectively removed from Monster's system after 23 April 2005. They identified that there was no evidence of data tampering with the IVR 'quicks log files' kept by Monster, but they were not able to examine all its relevant MySQL data files to verify the data (Ex A, pars 1-7). The experts observed that in Monster's records the proportion of download content represented by ringtones during the period between October 2003 and April 2005 was in the order of 18% (Ex 4 A8). 158 In addition, the experts observed that on 9 May 2005 at about midnight there was a significant decrease in the recorded download of all content types for which they agreed 'no logical reason could be put' (Ex 4, par A9). That decrease has continued ever since (T 192.11). What is more, the decrease was differential in its application to different types of downloads. The experts agreed that there 80% less pictures, 70% less coloured pictures and about 23% less polyphonic ringtone downloads. Thus, the number of database records for pictures declined from 3,500 in April 2005 to 698 records in May 2005. As Mr Woodley said: 'So you have had a significant drop off in contents across a number of categories, across all categories but significantly applying to the non-ringtone categories. ' (T 192.25) 159 No doubt, part of the explanation of the long term change was the fact that the popularity with consumers of IVR was in decline because cheaper SMS downloads had become possible in late 2004. While there had been some teething troubles in the introduction throughout the industry of SMS, by May 2005 it had become established. The experts could provide no explanation for the way in which the triple download spike occurred, why it was removed just before the audit was to commence, or why the radical change in reporting of downloads and Monster's business occurred at midnight on 9 May 2005. No-one from Monster explained any of these matters. 160 APRA and AMCOS argue that the inconsistencies and deficiencies in Monster's record keeping, and the lack of explanation for the way in which its records were kept in relation to the number of downloads, suggest that not all of the ringtone downloads or their relative proportions in relation to total downloads were being accurately recorded in the period between October 2003 and April 2005. Therefore, they said, the financial information necessary to calculate all royalties due on Monster's copying or communicating their copyright material was not being properly kept. 161 Monster argued that the triple download spike was a 'bug' which applied both to ringtone and non-ringtone products. It sought to demonstrate this by reference to examples, taken from its database which, certainly, showed that this could be so (Ex 1). It said that the number of downloads column was clearly wrong and could be ignored because it was possible to search electronically and allocate types of sales to royalty and non royalty chargeable categories without any need to refer at all to the number of downloads column. Monster denied any suggestion of wrongdoing in the recording of its information. 162 Monster did not call any evidence from its own internal resources (whether employees or outside computer consultants) who set up its computer software or were responsible for the input or analysis of data within Monster for the purposes of explaining why the software was set up in the way it was or how it operated in the way it did. Most significantly, no explanation was given as to what function the number of downloads column was supposed to serve or how it came to work in the very odd way in which it did. 163 There is no actual evidence that any tampering had occurred with the Monster data records. Mr Chong denied that he had altered the system to produce the anomaly of the triple download spike. And he said, to the best of his knowledge and belief, no such alteration had taken place (T 175.19). However, he emphasised, and I find, that he had a great understanding of Monster's system and would know if somebody changed it significantly (T 175.25-.30). 164 Mr Chong was an astute businessman. He would have wanted for his own commercial purposes an explanation of what was going on from those who reported to him in late April and early May 2005 when Monster's records began showing radical changes in customer behaviour. If the number of downloads column was a management tool, the correction of its operation on 23 April 2005 was significant. And, the dramatic fall of 9 May 2005, differential as it was across Monster's product lines, also went to the fundamentals of Monster's business. Mr Chong said that Mr Yap, Monster's technology manager, left Australia in November 2005 with his family and Mr Chong has neither seen nor heard from him since and he does not know to contact him in Singapore. That may be so. But, I am of opinion that the absence of any explanation by Mr Chong as to what he understood, before Mr Yap's departure, had occurred to his data base around the time of the audit is signal. He must have perceived the significance of the problem with the triple download spike when the Deloitte audit report arrived. The sudden and significant decline in the IVR business must also have come to his attention. Mr Chong was conscious that nothing that he could say on this topic could assist his or Monster's case ( Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8 ; (1959) 101 CLR 298). 165 In evidence he also claimed not to agree that there was such a thing as the triple download spike (T 176.15). I reject that evidence. Mr Chong was quite aware of the issues in the case and had read not only Deloitte's May 2005 audit report but also the expert evidence. As he said, he would know if somebody had changed his system significantly. The triple download spike disappeared from Monster's records after 23 April 2005. Likewise, there was a significant fall in Monster's recording of downloads on 9 May 2005. The coincidence of both these occurrences with Deloitte's audit cannot be ignored. I find that Mr Chong was aware of these occurrences and that on the balance of probabilities they were due to some alteration of Monster's computer systems of which he was fully aware. Neither expert could explain either change. They were significant, not to only Monster's own record keeping but also to the calculation of its liability for royalties due under the IVR licences. The only explanation which Mr Chong sought to give in his evidence was that Mr Yap had left the country six months later in November 2005. These issues were clearly flagged by the time Mr Chong came to give oral evidence yet he provided no explanation. 166 The most natural inference is that Mr Chong feared giving any explanation about these significant changes in the recording of data within Monster's systems: Commercial Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 22 NSWLR 389 at 418F-G per Handley JA; Temora Shire Council v Stein (2004) 134 LGERA 407 at 427 [52] per Giles JA with whom Hodson JA and Pearlman AJA agreed. I am not prepared to draw any inferences in favour of Monster and Mr Chong who have left entirely unexplained by evidence what happened within Monster's own record keeping in its computer system. I am not prepared to infer that Monster's records of ringtone downloads or their proportions as part of the overall downloads to its customers for the period between October 2003 and April 2005 are accurate or reliable. 167 The number of downloads could not possibly have dropped from 37,000 to 13,000 at midnight on 9 May 2005 without Mr Chong being aware that that had occurred (see T 192.4-.13). As Mr Woodley said, this was a significant decrease in anyone's language and it was not something that a business could undergo in virtually a day (T 192.32). The experts agreed that there was no logical reason that could be given for that change (Ex 4 par A9). About 97% of the triple download spike affected non ringtone content. The dramatic fall in sales in May 2005 differentially affected ringtones and other downloads, ringtones suffering only a 23% fall while others suffered over 70%. This differential related to the quantum of Monster's liability for royalties. 168 I find that not all entries in Monster's data base prior to 9 May 2005 reflected actual sales. Like the experts, I am not able to analyse how these two substantial changes in Monster's data records, which occurred in April and May 2005, affected Monster's actual sales for IVR downloads over the period between October 2003 and April 2005. 169 Between July and September 2003, ringtone downloads accounted for about 40% of Monster's IVR revenue. While Monster may have introduced more graphics for customers to download in October 2003 and following, I am not persuaded by Mr Chong's evidence that that accounted for the radical decline from October 2003 and thereafter from 40% of downloads being polyphonic or monophonic ringtones to only 20%. It is probable that, over time, Monster's IVR business developed and other products came to form a larger proportion of its IVR downloads than the 60% evident in its first quarter of operations. There was also a gradual reduction in the number but not the proportion of IVR service downloads generally, not just of ringtones, once the introduction of the SMS service occurred in late 2004. 170 The number of IVR calls recorded on Monster's Telstra revenue accounts increased between August 2003 and February 2004 and then gradually declined thereafter. The decline became more marked at around February 2005 and quite sharp thereafter. Monster's net call revenue followed the growth and then slow decline of the actual number of IVR calls. That indicated that the total number of downloads on IVR calls is likely to have been greater during the period between October 2003 and February 2005 than subsequently. This is shown by a graph in Mr Woodley's first report comparing from IVR data base records of Monster, the number of Telstra calls and the net call revenue recorded by Telstra. 171 Monster argued that Mr Mallett was wrong to base a claim for IVR royalties during the period between October 2003 and April 2005 on Monster's overall ringtone downloads of 41.31% in January to March 2006. It argued that although those results included MP3s, the introduction of the MP3 downloads added a new and significant line of business which substantially increased the proportion of ringtone downloads overall. Monster pointed to the fact that there was no issue of corruption of data of SMS downloads. These had remained relatively constant for monophonic and polyphonic downloads at about 20% of the total SMS downloads (when MP3 downloads were excluded). It said that this suggested that the similar observation of the experts that ringtone downloads, excluding MP3s, were about 18% to 20% the IVR totals after April 2005 was an accurate reflection of the amount of downloads for those two types of ringtone throughout the relevant period between October 2003 and April 2005. There is some force in that contention. However, the proportion of about 40% for ringtone downloads in both the periods between July 2003 to September 2003 and January 2006 to March 2006, together with the absence of explanation as to what happened to affect the IVR records of Monster, justifies an inference of a higher figure. It is likely that some part of the current market for MP3 ringtones must have been present earlier in the then market for available ringtones, in addition to the 18% to 20% of IVR downloads recorded by Monster as sales throughout the period between October 2003 and April 2005. I am of opinion that it is likely that customers downloading what then were the only two forms of ringtone, monophonic and polyphonic, would have downloaded a larger proportion of ringtones than 18% to 20%. 172 The experts agreed that the proportion of downloaded IVR content, included in Monster's records of all downloaded data represented by ringtones throughout the period October 2003 to April 2005, was in the order of 18%. They said that data analysis of IVR content type by reference to the content identification field in Monster's data base yielded a relevantly consistent ringtone download proportion of 18%-20%, excluding MP3s (Ex 4 A8 and A13). 173 Monster criticised Mr Woodley for asserting that some of its IVR records for the period between October 2003 and April 2005 did not represent actual sales. He said that there were differences between Monster's MySQL records to which he had access and its Telstra revenue statements. He considered that if the MySQL entries were not of actual sales, then there were only two possible explanations for the discrepancies: a 'bug' or deliberate tampering with the data base. He accepted that each of those explanations was a theoretical possibility. Both experts agreed that there was no issue of data tampering in Monster's IVR Quicks logfiles (Ex 4 par A7). They agreed that there was a likelihood that the triple download spike was caused by a 'bug' (Ex 4 par A6) and that it was unlikely to represent actual sales (Ex 4 par A4). Mr White considered that data base tampering was unlikely because: • the very large number of download records and call records generated each day would require editing of over 2,000 separate files on a real time basis; • if tampering occurred, the file date and times would have to be altered to the date on which the tampering was done which would have had to be about midnight on each date of the files in the review period. Mr White thought this was inherently unlikely; • alternatively, Monster would have to utilize special purpose software to make the alterations, which Mr White thought unlikely. 174 Mr White had not seen any systematic pattern in the contentious data. This indicated that no tampering had occurred. Mr Woodley observed that any tampering would have had to be done in a sophisticated manner. Nonetheless, neither expert could explain how the triple download spike originated, operated or ceased, other than to observe its presence in the data. And they could not explain why Monster's business records changed so radically on 9 May 2005. 175 Mr Woodley's analysis showed that after May 2005 there was a correlation between the ringtone proportions downloaded using IVR and SMS. This included MP3s after their introduction by Monster in October 2005. There was a slight decrease from the 20% in May 2005 to 15% in about August 2005, increasing to over 40% (including MP3) by January 2006. These changes show that it is not possible to ascribe any constant value to the proportion of downloads of ringtone products during this period. And, the unreliability of Monster's data over the 19 months to April 2005 makes scientific precision for that period impossible. I am not satisfied that it would be a true reflection of Monster's business to ascribe 41% of its revenue as being attributable to ringtone downloads for that period as is suggested by APRA and AMCOS. On the other hand, I am not satisfied that the ringtone content of about 18%-20% for that period contained in Monster's records is reliable. I am of opinion that it is more likely than not that the figure was considerably larger than 18%, particularly towards the earlier part of the period. Because each of the removal of the triple download spike bug and the 9 May 2005 fall differentially affected the proportion of ringtone downloads recorded in Monster's system, I am satisfied that the figure of 18% is an understatement. 176 I formed the impression that both the experts were impressive, helpful and objective witnesses. Mr Woodley had, however, a greater familiarity with a deal of the evidence than Mr White because the latter had done no analysis on some areas in issue where Mr Woodley had. That is not a criticism of Mr White. Rather it reflects that Mr White's instructions and the material to which he was given access were more circumscribed. 177 In The Commonwealth v Amann Aviation Pty Limited [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 at 83, Mason CJ and Dawson J said that mere difficulty in estimating damages does not relieve a court from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can. They continued: 'Indeed, in Jones v Schiffmann ((1971) [1971] HCA 52 ; 124 CLR 303 at 308) Menzies J went so far as to say that the \"assessment of damages ... does sometimes, of necessity, involve what is guess work rather than estimation\". Where precise evidence is not available the Court must do the best it can ( Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 at 438 per Devlin J)' See too at 174 CLR at 119 per Deane J, 138 per Toohey J. 178 This is a case where APRA and AMCOS cannot adduce precise evidence of what has been lost in Monster's records. Thus it is apt to do the best I can in assessing damages on the material available to me: Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10 ; (2003) 77 ALJR 768 at 774 [38] per Hayne J with whom Gleeson CJ, McHugh and Kirby JJ agreed. QUANTIFICATION 179 At the commencement of the 19 month period to April 2005, IVR downloads of ringtones were at the level of 40%. The IVR method of delivery of ringtones was then the only one employed by Monster. SMS only commenced to be used 1 year later. Monster's business was expanding in October 2003 and its revenues were increasing. It is highly unlikely that within the month of October 2003 ringtone downloads fell from 40% to around 18% of all of Monster's downloads. While the expansion of the range of non ringtone downloads offered by Monster after September 2003 many explain a change in the proportion of ringtone downloads, such a change is more likely to have been gradual. By May 2005, when Monster was the subject of the audit by Deloitte, both IVR and SMS ringtone downloads accounted for about 18%-20% of all of Monster's download revenue. Later, when MP3 ringtone downloads were offered, overall ringtone revenues were closer to 40%. Part of the explanation for the percentage of ringtone downloads in any pereiod must be what was on offer. But no evidence was led, apart from the effect of introducing MP3 ringtones, as to whether and when new ringloads were actually offered by Monster in its advertisements and what impact that had on demand. 180 Mr Chong did an analysis which showed that in the period between December 2004 and March 2005, 26% of the SMS downloads were ringtones. Some caution must be given to these figures because of the teething problems experienced generally by the download industry with the introduction of the SMS platform. In the same period, he said that ringtones represented, on Monster's data, only 12% of IVR downloads. The latter figure is implausible. It shows that Monster's IVR data at that time was unreliable given that its subsequent trading has shown a rough correspondence between IVR and SMS ringtone downloads as a proportion of Monster's overall revenues. There is no reason on the evidence why customers would distinguish between ringtone and non ringtone downloads in this period when making IVR and SMS orders. 181 In my opinion, the proportion of IVR downloads which were ringtones in the December 2004 to March 2005 period is likely to have been closer to Mr Chong's 26% SMS figure, making due allowances for the possible unreliability of SMS data at that time. 182 Precise calculation of the proportion ringtones in Monster's IVR downloads during the period between October 2003 and April 2005 is not possible. I find that there was a gradual decline from about 40% to about 20% over that period. By March 2005 the proportion was about 25%, roughly in line with Mr Chong's analysis of Monster's SMS business results at that time. 183 I find that APRA's and AMCOS's entitlement to IVR royalties for the period between October 2003 and April 2005 should be calculated on the basis that 30% of Monster's net call revenue was derived from the use of copyright works the subject of the IVR licences. ISSUE 8: ARE APRA AND AMCOS ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL DAMAGES UNDER s 115 OF THE COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 ? 184 Monster failed to pay any royalties under the IVR or SMS licences prior to the termination of the IVR licences in August 2005. It not only failed to pay any royalties under the SMS licences prior to their termination in December 2005 but it also did not provide even the simplest information in the form of its telecommunications service provider's revenue statements. Monster's argument that these failures were based on its bona fide misconstruction of the licences in relation to whether or not a form was prescribed by APRA or AMCOS for the purposes of the licences has been rejected by me (cp DTR Nominess Pty Limited v Mona Homes Pty Limited [1978] HCA 12 ; (1978) 138 CLR 423 at 432). Indeed, I am not satisfied that Monster has provided the Court with full information as to the true position during the period between October 2003 and April 2005 for the reasons that I have given earlier. 185 The claim for additional damages under s 115(4) requires an applicant to prove, that an infringement of copyright has been established. Once the IVR and SMS licences respectively were terminated in August and December 2005 Monster infringed the copyrights of APRA and AMCOS by continuing its business of supplying ringtone downloads. That infringement continues to the present time. 186 The next question under s 115(4)(b) is for the Court to be satisfied that it is proper to make such an award having regard to all relevant matters, including but not limited to: • the flagrancy of the infringement; • the need to deter similar infringements; • the conduct of Monster and Mr Chong after any act constituting the infringement, or if relevant, after they were informed of the alleged infringement; • any benefit shown to have accrued to Monster or Mr Chong by reason of the infringement. 187 Here, after each licence's termination, Monster negotiated with APRA and AMCOS for new licences to be put in place. Had the negotiations been successfully concluded this would have resulted in there being no infringement. There was no explanation by Monster as to why it failed until 7 February 2006 to return executed IVR licences and the settlement agreement forwarded with Banki Haddock Fiora's letter of 28 October 2005. The arguments may have occurred between the parties as to the quantum of APRA's and AMCOS' claim for further royalties from the period the subject of Deloitte's audit could not have affected entry into the new arrangements proposed in the 28 October 2005 letter which envisaged the right of each of the parties to contest the amount of royalties due or claimed. Monster's failure to return the executed agreements was, in my opinion, deliberate. It knew that it had no licence to use APRA's and AMCOS' copyright material while ever licences were not in place. 188 Mr Chong gave evidence-in-chief that, on the basis of the conduct and statements by APRA and AMCOS preceding the letter of 24 October 2005, he assumed they would grant Monster binding licences effective from 18 August 2005 in respect of IVR downloads of ringtones. Alternatively, he said, he assumed that in respect of IVR ringtones, Monster would be able to communicate to the public, APRA's and AMCOS' works for which they were entitled to grant licences. He said that on the basis of that assumption, Monster continued to operate its ringtone business. He also referred to APRA and AMCOS' willingness to accept the licence fees paid on 16 September 2005 and 14 October 2005 as part of that assumption. Given that those sums were due under the invoices rendered on 30 May 2005 it is unlikely that APRA and AMCOS would have refused to have received that money paid very substantially later after the invoices were rendered. That is, Mr Chong knew that there were no IVR licences in place but assumed that Monster would be granted them apparently, at any future time it chose, regardless of what it did in the interim. I do not believe this evidence. No businessman of his astuteness would have thought APRA and AMCOS would allow the licence position to remain unresolved indefinitely while Monster failed to provide information or prompt payment. 189 On the other hand, on and after 31 January 2006, APRA and AMCOS indicated to Monster that they were prepared to accept a sum substantially greater than I have found was due as the price for the grant of new IVR and SMS licences. In that situation, Monster would either have had to cease any ringtone downloads entirely as part of its business or accede to APRA's and AMCOS' demands. 190 By its infringing conduct Monster has benefited from sales of the copyright works. One of the purposes of an award of additional damages under s 115(4) is to penalise a defendant or respondent for its conduct of infringement. 191 I have considerable reservations about Mr Chong's credibility. Initially, he gave evidence that he believed that the downloading of the MP3 files that he had caused to be created was lawful and was absolutely sure about that. But, when confronted by correspondence Monster had received on that topic from Music Industry Privacy Investigation Pty Ltd, he then agreed that he was absolutely certain it was unlawfull (PCWS2 pars 27-28). It would obviously have been disadvantageous to Mr Chong to have said that he engaged in a business which he believed to be unlawful. Counsel for Mr Chong and Monster asked me to interpret his evidence as being directed to two different points in time, the first, being addressed to what he believed when he commenced the MP3 downloading and the second, to when he discovered what was happening was not legal. I do not accept that explanation. His evidence that what was done was lawful was given clearly and was unequivocal. Mr Chong had every opportunity to qualify it at the time. I formed the impression that he saw it to his advantage to portray himself as not having acted unlawfully. 192 Mr Chong said that he had been in Singapore and Taiwan establishing similar businesses for 13 weeks between March 2005 and November 2005. In the previous year he had given evidence to the Migration Review Tribunal. He claimed that his visa to remain in Australia ought be reinstated because his presence was material to the continued operation of Monster's business and its essential success. He agreed that nothing had changed in these respects between the time he gave his evidence to the tribunal and the period in 2005 when he was away overseas. But he claimed his activities overseas in 2005 had distracted him from Monster's business and he was unable to direct sufficient attention to consider how he might prepare proper returns to APRA and AMCOS. I do not accept that he was distracted as he claimed. 193 On 20 May 2005 the solicitors for a photographer, Anne Geddes, wrote to Monster and Mr Chong seeking undertakings that the use of one of her photographs in Monster's advertising for downloads would not be continued. I infer that Mr Chong ignored that letter because on 20 June 2005 Ms Geddes commenced proceedings for infringement in the Victorian Registry of the Court (Ex H). Monster's Victorian lawyers, Blake Dawson Waldron, wrote to Ms Geddes' lawyers on 17 July 2005 asserting that after receipt of the letter of 20 May 2005 Monster promptly removed the copy of the photograph from its systems some time in late May or early June 2005. Monster's explanation was that the photograph had been purchased in a CD-ROM in late 2003 from Integrated Marketing Communications Pty Ltd, a Singaporean company, and that Monster had understood that it was free to use images from that source in its services. It said that the Singaporean company now no longer operated (Ex H). The proceedings were settled in late August 2005. 194 Yet, in cross-examinaiton Mr Chong agreed that Monster was still advertising other images received from the same source. He claimed that he really believed that Monster had a legal right to sell those images. He then gave this evidence (T170.28-172.3): 'MR LEEMING: ... My question to you and I wish to give you as full an opportunity as you can have to explain your evidence, is why you say in March this year you believed that you had the right to sell Buffy and 50 cent and Scooby Doo notwithstanding that the source of that right was this defunct Singapore company and you had already gone through the experience with Ms Geddes' works that it didn't have the rights to sell some of the products they were supplying to you. I want to give you as much opportunity as you need to respond to that? ... I can't give you a straight answer until deciding what is and what is not that we had a right to, if that is what you are saying. I am not understanding. HIS HONOUR: I think what Mr Leeming is asking you is, you had the experience of dealing with litigation in this court in Victoria brought by Ms Geddes to say you had no right to sell the picture that you received from the Singapore company? ... Yes. And he is saying, well after you had actually gone to court and decided you should pay damages and settle the proceedings? ... Right. How could you have any confidence that anything else you got from the Singapore company they had a right to give to you so that you could market it without infringing people's copyright? ... We can't be absolutely sure, your Honour. So in terms of confidence we don't know for a fact either way, one way or the other . Well, Mr Leeming is asking you how in March you could have believed, having had the bad experience with Ms Geddes from the Singapore companies that anything else they gave you they had a right to give you when you couldn't contact them and you had nothing else to, as I understand your evidence, to show that they had the rights to sell you things they said they sold you? ...That is right. So that is what I think he is asking you. MR LEEMING: Your Honour has it exactly? ...I don't know how to answer that. I am just believing that they do have. That is because there isn't an answer. MR JACKMAN: Please let him finish. MR LEEMING: I'm sorry, did you have something else to say? ... No. I think you said I have nothing else to say? ... I don't know how else to explain this point of what we believe is that they have a right to give us . I think that is what we are trying to get at. We looked at the pictures as I have just explained before. A lot of these pictures are what we use maxims or copy lines, nice lines one or two things, we don't know even if somebody owns the copyright and I could be infringing . But if I had to take off everything, but we try to create but we don't create as much as we do. A lot of them approach us. For instance, Ford. If Ford approaches us then we will talk to the company, Express Publications, and ask them and say you give us this, you say we can use it to advertise. That is how we work. Can I suggest to you, Mr Chong, that the reason you are finding it difficult to explain why in March 2006 you believed that this Singapore company did have the rights to permit you to sell Buffy and 50 cent and Scooby Doo images is because you didn't believe that in March 2006? ... We believed we do. Instead in March 2006 you believed there was at least a real risk that they did not have, that is the Singapore company, did not have those rights to licence for your commercial purposes? ... We believe we do. If we are given a letter saying we don't then we will stop it immediately. I just can't explain it any other way. That is the policy we try to adopt so we don't fight with owners of intellectual property . And the reason that you are refusing to agree to the questions I am putting to you is that you know if you do it will impact adversely you and your company's prospects in this litigation, that is the reason, isn't it? ... No, not for that reason, no. Can I elaborate please? Of course? ... If I were to advertise anything and everything of any brand, I am just coming an example for Ferrari or Playboy or something then it is wrong because then we advertise everything. But there comes a time when what you have is what you have and the rest of it you stop doing it. In our world we stopped what we call backyard sales guys who doesn't give us the real rights, if I could use that word. So we have stopped doing that. So if I say I would advertise anything and everything that is ridiculous because I would be infringing every one on earth in terms of copyright. ' (emphasis added) 195 And, these were not the only instances in which Monster had advertised and sold to the public downloads for which it had or may have had no rights but simply took the chance of infringement of others' copyright. For example in 2005 Monster advertised and sold images of Australian Football League Club logos for downloading on to mobile phones. He said that after talking with representatives of the League he came to appreciate that Monster did not have the rights to offer those for sale. He also said that Monster was able to sell a download in relation to Ford, the car manufacturer, because there was a relationship with a publication that dealt in the motor industry from which that logo was obtained. He claimed to have understood that the magazine had the rights assigned from or licensed from Ford and that they were able to give Monster such a licence. 196 Mr Chong's and Monster's attitude to respecting the copyright of others was in essence what he said when confronted with his conduct in relation to Ms Geddes' photograph and the AFL and NRL rights: 'Our policy is if someone tells us that you don't have the right, the first thing we do is we do not argue with them because they say they have the rights so we pull back. ' 197 In my opinion this attitude was quite reckless. It did not recognize the need to respect other people's commercial and legal rights in their property, including copyright, with which he and it dealt. I infer that his attitude was that he would continue marketing any material notwithstanding a belief that there was a real possibility that Monster had no rights to do so, just as he did with material on the CD-ROM from which Ms Geddes' photograph was taken. He deliberately closed his eyes to the lawfulness of this activity. That is consistent with Mr Chong's and Monster's apparent unwillingness to give any proper information or accounting to APRA and AMCOS for the copyright material which, again, Monster sought to exploit in its business. 198 In Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 93A-B, Burchett J (with whom Lehane J agreed at 104F) applied an earlier statement he had made in Autodesk Inc v Yee (1996) 68 FCR 391 at 394 that in Australia additional damages may be given upon principles corresponding to those governing awards of aggravated and also exemplary damages at common law. He said that the Act had objectives other than compensation (75 FCR at 93E-F). Each of the factors referred to in s 115(4)(b) is sufficient in itself to sustain an award of additional damages. It is not necessary that each of them must be proved, rather that the relevant conduct of the defendant or respondent in the circumstances warrants an award. Tamberlin J came to a similar conclusion (75 FCR at 102E-104E). He noted the importance of preserving a broad unfettered discretion in relation to additional damages so far as quantum was concerned (75 FCR at 104D) and, that broad discretion should not be formulated in any arithmetic or mechanical way (75 FCR at 104C). I do not think that this is a case of mere mistake or neglect (75 FCR at 93C; Prior v Lansdowne Press Pty Ltd [1977] VR 65 at 70; (1975) 12 ALR 685 at 90). 199 In FNH Investments Pty Ltd v Sullivan (2003) 59 IPR 121, at 127 [26]-[27], Whitlam, Moore and Kiefel JJ held that the new existence of a contractual relationship between a copyright owner and an alleged infringer did not preclude the award of additional damages under s 115(4). There, a contract existed for the provision of photographs and, provided that certain sums were paid, a licence would be granted to use the photographs. The infringement occurred before the full licence fee was paid. The situation in the present case is different because prior to the termination of the IVR licences on 17 August 2005 and the SMS licences on 12 December 2005 Monster was licensed to use APRA's and AMCOS' works but was in breach of the respective licences because it had not provided proper information or paid sufficient royalties. At the time of each licence's termination, no royalties whatsoever had been paid under it. Thereafter Monster continued to use, and Mr Chong continued to participate in Monster's use of, copyright works knowing of the lack of any licence to do so. I am conscious that there were negotiations ongoing between the parties, which had they been successfully concluded would have resulted in authorisation for the period of the use. Nonetheless, Monster for its own commercial purposes chose not to have that authorisation, particularly in respect of the IVR licences after 28 October 2005. I am of opinion that this behaviour showed a contumelious disregard of the rights of APRA and AMCOS in their copyright material. 200 I think that Mr Chong's attitude, which was also Monster's, towards the non-payment of royalties to APRA and AMCOS was quite flagrant. Mr Chong thought he could get away without paying for what was due just as he did with trying to get away with using other people's rights without having first made any, let alone, proper arrangements for their use. I think there should be an appropriate marking of the Court's disapproval by a significant award (see Raben Footwear Pty Ltd v Polygram Records Inc (1997) 75 FCR 88 at 102-103; cp: Australian Performing Right Association Ltd v Pashalidis (2000) 48 IPR 610 at 619 [32] per Moore J). 201 Monster's and Mr Chong's conduct merits a substantial amount of additional damages being awarded so as to mark disapproval of its infringing conduct and to deter others from engaging in similar behaviour. During the 3 year period to 30 June 2006 Monster's total revenues from all its telecommunications service providers accounts total over $19 million. These include considerable revenues generated by the infringements. But the use of ringtone downloads was a means of attracting Monster's customers to all its advertised products. In my opinion, on the basis of my findings, I should fix the amount of additional damages at $100,000. 202 An award of additional damages should not impose a punishment greater than would be imposed if the conduct were criminal ( XL Petroleum (NSW) Pty Ltd v Caltex Oil (Australia) Pty Ltd [1985] HCA 12 ; (1985) 155 CLR 448 at 463 per Gibbs J). The defendant's financial circumstances are a relevant consideration ( XL 155 CLR at 461 per Gibbs CJ, 472 per Brennan J) as has been the period of the conduct and its circumstances. CONCLUSION 203 I am satisfied that there is a real risk that Monster and Mr Chong will continue to infringe APRA's and AMCOS' copyrights unless restrained. It is appropriate to grant injunctive relief to prevent Monster's continuing infringements: Universal Music Australia Pty Limited v Cooper [2005] FCA 1878 at [13] . 204 Having regard to my findings, it is necessary for calculations to be made as to the precise sums to be awarded by way of damages. I will direct the applicants to bring in short minutes of order to give effect to my reasons. This will allow the respondents to check the calculation of any royalties. It follows that the respondents should pay the applicants' costs. I certify that the preceding two hundred and four (204) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.

These proceedings are brought pursuant to s 39B(1) and (1A) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) ( Judiciary Act ) and ss 19 , 21 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth) ( FCA ). Mr Zentai's application for review in its amended form is as follows: On the grounds stated in the accompanying affidavit of Denis Barich filed this day, the Applicant claims principal relief pursuant to sections 19 , 21 and 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and interlocutory relief pursuant to Order 4 Rule 9 of the Federal Court Rules. (a) against the First Respondent, the Commonwealth Minister for Home Affairs ( the Minister ), acting as delegate of the Second Respondent, the Commonwealth Attorney General, in respect of the Minister's decision made on 12 November 2009 ( the surrender decision ) that the Applicant may be surrendered fro extradition to the Republic of Hungary pursuant to sections 22 and 23 of the Extradition Act 1988 ( the Act ); (b) against the Second Respondent, in respect of a decision made by the Minister for Justice and Customs, acting as a delegate of the Second Respondent ( the s.16 decision ) to issue a Notice of Receipt of Extradition Request ( the s.16 notice ) under Section 16(1) of the Act; (c) against the Third Respondent, a Magistrate of the State of Western Australia in issuing a warrant dated 20 August 2008 pursuant to section 19(9) of the Act, committing the Applicant to imprisonment in Hakea Prison, Canning Vale, Western Australia ( the committal order ), and (d) against the Fourth Respondent, the Officer in Charge of Hakea Prison, in whose custody the Applicant is at present, for an order to release the Applicant from custody. Mr Zentai seeks orders as follows: An order in the nature of certiorari against the Second Respondent to quash the s.16 decision, and the s.16 notice made pursuant to that decision. A declaration that the committal order is unlawful and of no legal effect, and an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the committal order. A declaration that the surrender decision is void and of no legal effect. An order in the nature of certiorari against the First Respondent to quash the surrender decision. An order for an injunction or an order in the nature of prohibition to restrain and prohibit the First Respondent from giving further effect to the surrender decision. An order in the nature of certiorari to quash the surrender warrant issued by the First Respondent on 12 November 2009 authorising the Officer in Charge of Hakea Prison ( Third Respondent ) to release the Applicant into the custody of officers of the Republic of Hungary ( the surrender warrant ). An order in the nature of habeas corpus directed to the Fourth Respondent requiring him to produce the Applicant to his Honourable Court and release the Applicant from custody. Such other orders as this Honourable Court sees fit. These reasons concern only the urgent motion for the granting of bail entitling him to be released from his current imprisonment. On 16 December 2009, bail was granted to Mr Zentai on similar terms and conditions to those imposed on previous occasions in relation to his challenges to extradition. In doing so, I indicated that I would publish reasons. These are the reasons. BACKGROUND Although the background has been traced in previous judgments, it is convenient to update the current position as these proceedings are brought on a different jurisdictional basis from those preceding them. On 20 August 2008, Magistrate Barbara Lane, in the Magistrates Court of Western Australia, Perth determined that Mr Zentai was eligible for extradition to Hungary under s 19(1) of the Extradition Act and further issued a warrant under s 19(9) of the Extradition Act ordering committal of Mr Zentai to prison to await surrender. Later on the same day, on 20 August 2008, Mr Zentai made an application to the Court under ss 21(2)(b) and 21 (2)(b)(i) of the Extradition Act for an order to quash the order of Magistrate Lane made on 20 August 2008, by which Mr Zentai was found eligible for surrender for extradition to the Republic of Hungary. In addition, on 20 August 2008, Mr Zentai made an application for an order that he be released on bail pursuant to s 21(6)(f)(iv) of the Extradition Act . On 20 August 2008, I granted Mr Zentai bail on the following terms: The applicant Charles Zentai, after complying with the conditions set out in Schedule 1 to this order, be released on bail with a duty to surrender to the Federal Court of Australia upon the order of the Federal Court of Australia on a date and time to be notified to the applicant by an officer of the Federal Court of Australia. Schedule 1 Pursuant to section 21(6)(f)(iv) of the Extradition Act 1988 , the Applicant be released on bail on the following terms and conditions: $50,000.00 personal undertaking; $75,000.00 surety; Surrender all passports and not apply for any passports; Not to approach within 100 metres of any point of domestic or international departure and not to leave Australia; and Reside at 2/10 Millar Place, Willetton WA. From 20 August 2008 until 31 March 2009, Mr Zentai was released on bail pursuant to my orders of 20 August 2008. On 31 March 2009, Gilmour J dismissed Mr Zentai's application to quash the Magistrate's decision ( Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2009] FCA 284). His Honour further ordered a stay of the orders, resulting from his judgment of 31 March 2009, until 7 April 2009. On 6 April 2009, Mr Zentai lodged an appeal from the whole of the judgment of Gilmour J given on 31 March 2009. The appeal was brought pursuant to the provisions of s 21(3) of the Extradition Act . On 7 April 2009, his Honour ordered a further stay of his orders until 11 May 2009. On 7 May 2009, the orders of 31 March 2009 were further stayed until 4.00 pm on 12 May 2009. On 12 May 2009, Gilmour J granted bail to Mr Zentai ( Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2009] FCA 511) in the following terms: Charles Zentai (\"the Appellant\") after complying with the conditions set out in Schedule 1 to this Order, be released on bail with a duty to surrender to the Federal Court of Australia upon the order of the Federal Court of Australia on a date and time to be notified to the Appellant by an officer of the Federal Court of Australia. The Appellant's passport, currently in the possession of the Magistrates Court of Western Australia, be transferred to the custody of the Australian Federal Police. Schedule 1 Pursuant to s 21(6)(f)(iv) of the Extradition Act 1988 , the Appellant be released on bail on the following terms and conditions: $50,000.00 personal undertaking; $75,000.00 surety; Surrender all passports and not apply for any passports; Not to approach within 100 metres of any point of the domestic or international departure and not to leave Australia; and Reside at 2/10 Millar Place, Willetton, WA. On 24 August 2009, prior to the hearing of Mr Zentai's appeal to the Full Court of this Court, on 25 August 2009, Mr Zentai filed further submissions for extension of bail pending the delivery of the Full Court's decision. On 8 October 2009, the Full Court (constituted by Black CJ, Tracey, and Barker JJ) dismissed Mr Zentai's appeal ( Zentai v Republic of Hungary (2009) 260 ALR 400). The Full Court made the following orders: The appeal be dismissed. The appellant pay the first respondent's costs. For the purposes of s 21(6)(g) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) the appellant is eligible for surrender within the meaning of s 19(2) of the Act in relation to an extradition offence. The order of the second respondent made pursuant to s 19(9) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Cth) on 20 August 2008 be confirmed. Execution of these orders and the order of the second respondent made 20 August 2008 be stayed for 14 days. The appellant's bail is confirmed on the same terms as granted by Gilmour J on 12 May 2009. On 15 October 2009, Mr Zentai confirmed in writing to the Department of Attorney-General that he would not be instituting an application for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia from the Full Court's decision of 8 October 2009. On 22 October 2009, Mr Zentai presented himself to the Australian Federal Police and was placed in custody at Hakea Prison in Western Australia. Mr Zentai now applies for an order to be released on bail, until the hearing and determination of his application for review by this Court, upon the same terms and conditions as those ordered by Gilmour J on 12 May 2009. JURISDICTION AND POWER The jurisdiction to review the determination made by the Minister under s 22 of the Extradition Act arises under s 39B of the Judiciary Act . That jurisdiction having been invoked, the Court may, under s 23 FCA in respect of matters in which it has jurisdiction, make such orders including interlocutory orders as it deems appropriate. This bail application is not made (nor can it be) under the Extradition Act . These proceedings relate to but are not dependent upon the specific provisions of that Act. It is common ground that special circumstances need to be shown together with, in effect, no risk of flight before bail should be granted in extradition proceedings, particularly at an advanced stage of those proceedings. Before turning to those considerations, it is necessary to consider whether or not in the context of an application which is based on s 23 FCA, the Court has jurisdiction and power under the incidental power provisions of s 23 FCA to grant bail on an application such as the present. The current case may be contrasted with Peniche v Vanstone [1999] FCA 1688 ; (1999) 96 FCR 38 and Chan v Minister for Justice and Customs [2001] FCA 170 ; (2001) 108 FCR 65 where Kenny J and Stone J respectively declined to grant bail on the basis that the primary relief sought in those cases would not, in any event, have brought about the release of the applicant in those cases from custody. The primary relief (as amended) in the present case is somewhat different. In Peniche, Kenny J (at 47) considered (obiter) that there was much to be said for the view that the provisions for remand on bail in the Extradition Act were not an exclusive code. In Peniche , at p 47, Kenny J expressed the view (obiter) that those provisions: do not preclude the power of the Court to entertain an application for an interlocutory injunction restraining a proper respondent from detaining an extraditee in custody in cases where the validity of decisions to arrest, or to remand in custody, or like decisions are the subject of challenge in judicial review proceedings: see, for example, Hempel v Moore (1987) 13 FCR 480 ; 70 ALR 714 ; Prevato v Governor, Metropolitan Remand Centre [1986] FCA 17 ; (1986) 8 FCR 358 , and Elmi v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1988) 17 ALD 471 at 472-473. As I have sought to show, that is not the situation in these proceedings. In Peniche as in Chan , the ultimate relief even if granted would not have had the effect of releasing the applicant from custody. On the other hand, in the present application, Mr Zentai's challenge includes two grounds which go directly to whether he is an extraditable person. If he were to succeed on either of those grounds, it would not be open to the Minister to make a further determination under s 22 of the Extradition Act that Mr Zentai is to be surrendered in relation to the specified extradition offence. The application (as now amended) does seek appropriate orders which would result in Mr Zentai's ultimate release were the application to succeed and subject to further appeal. The two grounds of challenge which go to the heart of the issue as to whether he is an extraditable person are, first, that Mr Zentai is not 'accused' of an extradition offence as the extradition is sought only for the purpose of preliminary investigation. The second challenge is that Mr Zentai is not an extraditable person because the extradition offence in relation to which the Magistrate determined he was eligible for surrender under s 19(9) of the Extradition Act was not an offence in the Republic of Hungary at the time of the acts or omissions constituting the offence. This argument relies on Art 2, para 5 of the Treaty on Extradition between Australia and the Republic of Hungary 1995 ( the Extradition Treaty ). Accordingly, the present circumstances are distinguishable from the decisions in Chan and Peniche where the ultimate success of the outcome of those applications would not affect the warrant under s 19 of the Extradition Act under which the applicant was held in each instance. THE ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF BAIL In United Mexican States v Cabal (2001) 209 CLR 165 the High Court of Australia held it did not have the power to grant bail under the Extradition Act until special leave to appeal was granted. It did have an incidental power to its appellate jurisdiction (conferred by s 73 of the Constitution ). That power included doing all that was necessary to effectuate the grant of appellate jurisdiction including the power to stay orders that were or might become the subject of its appellate jurisdiction and to grant bail so as to make the stay effective. However, it held that bail should only be granted in extradition cases when two conditions were fulfilled. The first condition was that the circumstances of the case must be special in the sense that they were different from those that persons facing extradition would ordinarily endure when regard was had to the nature and extent of the extradition charges. The second was that there be an absence of any real risk of flight considered independently of the effect of any proposed bail conditions. It was held that where special circumstances were proven and there was no real risk of flight, bail may be granted unless the applicant posed a risk to the community or a particular individual. However, the Court did emphasise that one of the most important factors was the stage which the extradition proceedings have reached. As the case proceeds through the legal system, the chance of obtaining bail reduces despite the existence of special circumstances. Something 'exceptional' would need to be shown before bail would be granted by the High Court in extradition proceedings before a grant of special leave to appeal. The current circumstances are slightly different. Although there has been a deal of preceding litigation, it is a different jurisdictional basis and it is the incidental power of s 23 FCA which falls now for consideration. The power is to be exercised (if at all) by a single judge. Nevertheless, even though there are some stages beyond the present application for review, there is little doubt that the litigation viewed as a whole has advanced to a considerable degree. That said, the observations made by the High Court as to the need for 'exceptional circumstances' are expressly and inextricably linked to the high likelihood, indeed 'presumption', of flight when the only remaining legal avenue is a special leave application (and perhaps an appeal if special leave is granted) ( Cabal at [64]). Not only is the current application brought at an earlier stage (albeit that the litigation has ensued for some time) but for reasons indicated below, the flight risk is virtually non-existent. SPECIAL OR EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES Both in Cabal and in State Courts (Mercanti v Western Australia [2005] WASCA 254 at [17] and Lim v Gregson [1989] WAR 1 (at 13)) in the context of bail, the adjectives 'special' and 'exceptional' where applied to 'circumstances' are used interchangeably. Unlike the facts in Cabal , Mr Zentai is not an alien who has come relatively recently from another country, leaving a secret cache of money overseas and who has prepared false documents preparatory to flight. In contrast, Mr Zentai has lived in Australia for over half a century. His support base including family and medical facilities are all located nearby. He is now aged 88. In a report from Dr Donald Latchem, Cardiologist of 8 May 2009, Dr Latchem reports: Since I last reported to you on his condition in November 2007 there does appear to have been a deterioration in his symptoms, in particular he reports an increase in the frequency and duration of attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. He has had admissions to Emergency Departments both here at St John of God Hospital Murdoch and Fremantle Hospital on 29 January 2008, 10 August 2008 and 30 January 2009 with AF that's reverted spontaneously within 24 hours. In between times he is reporting palpitations on an almost daily basis and these are associated with generally feeling weak, \"strange in the head\" and occasionally are associated with chest pains and breathing difficulties ... Mr Zentai's chief problems are ongoing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation which appears to be a chronic condition and we would have difficulty improving on the control as he's already had toxic side-effects from the best anti-arrhythmic agent for this that's currently available (Amiodarone). The atrial fibrillation is likely to get worse with time and is likely to continue to cause Mr Zentai the recurrent symptoms described above but also places him at risk of complications of stroke and heart failure. Whilst the stress of incarceration might exacerbate this condition I don't have any conclusive evidence that this would be the case. Mr Zentai is likely to require ongoing medical treatment for his problem and this may include admissions to hospital ... Mr Zentai was reviewed by a medical practitioner engaged for the Minister. That practitioner's conclusions, while perhaps a little less gloomy, were similar, broadly speaking. In previous bail applications brought by Mr Zentai (such as Zentai v Republic of Hungary [2008] FCA 1335) it has been accepted that the risk of flight is extremely low. His age, medical condition previously described in earlier applications, long association as an Australian citizen, strong family connections with the Australian community, lack of financial resources (as a pensioner) are circumstances which, of themselves, make any risk of his absconding most unlikely. Added to those circumstances (and accepting that flight risk must be considered independently of any bail conditions), the conditions imposed on the orders directing his release including the impounding of his passport and the requirement that he regularly report to authorities and his movements be restricted realistically mean that there is no risk of Mr Zentai absconding. Although his medical conditions have previously been referred to, that has been updated in recent evidence. THE STRENGTH OF THE GROUNDS OF REVIEW It is also common ground that the Court is required to form, at least, a preliminary view as to whether the grounds for review raise a serious question ( Cabal (at [62])). If it were apparent that the prospects of success on the main application were low, that would be a real factor to consider in the exercise of discretion as to whether or not to grant bail. Given the serious nature of the reciprocal obligations owed under extradition treaties and the importance of such treaties to Australia, obviously weak or colourable claims would not attract a favourable exercise of the discretion to grant bail. In contrast but without in any way speculating on its ultimate outcome, this application for review is extensive, comprehensive and has been carefully prepared. It raises a number of particular grounds of review based on specific provisions of the Extradition Treaty. The Extradition Treaty by virtue of s 11(1C) of the Extradition Act and the Extradition (Republic of Hungary) Regulations modifies the operation of the Extradition Act . The provisions of the Extradition Treaty, therefore, are important. For Mr Zentai it is argued that some of the provisions are fundamental in the sense that they preclude entirely, as a matter of law, the Minister exercising his jurisdiction under ss 22 and 23 of the Extradition Act . In essence, Mr Zentai argues that he is not an 'extraditable person' within the meaning of s 6 of the Extradition Act , because he is not 'accused' of a war crime, his extradition having been sought by the Republic of Hungary only for the purposes of initial investigation. Accordingly, there is no lawful basis for any proceedings against him under the Act. It is argued that this ground is strongly supported by statements made by the head of the Military Division, Budapest Metropolitan Court that issued the international arrest warrant on which the Hungarian request for extradition is based. It is argued that not only is this a substantial and significant ground for review but it also is a 'special circumstance'. Mr Zentai contends: Article 2 para 5 of the Extradition Treaty has the effect that the alleged war crime is not an 'extradition offence ' , which is the foundation of the request for surrender. There was therefore no jurisdictional basis for the Magistrate (under s 19 of the Extradition Act ) and the Minister (under s 22 of the Extradition Act ) to determine Mr Zentai's eligibility for surrender (Mr Zentai says this was an issue addressed, but not determined, in previous proceedings before the Full Court, which granted bail pending appeal); Article 3 para (1)(f)(ii) of the Extradition Treaty constitutes an absolute prohibition on the Attorney-General making an order to surrender Mr Zentai, because the Military Division of the relevant Hungarian court that issued a warrant for his arrest and before which he is liable to be tried (if charged) is a tribunal 'that is only occasionally, or under exceptional circumstances, authorised to try persons accused of the offence for which extradition is sought'. As a matter of discretion, the Attorney-General, erred in law in failing to refuse surrender (or give proper or any consideration to the refusal of surrender) on the basis of Art 3 para (2)(f) of the Extradition Treaty, namely, that in the circumstances, including the age, health and other personal circumstances of Mr Zentai, his extradition would be unjust, oppressive, incompatible with humanitarian considerations or too severe a punishment. Relevant circumstances are: (i) The fact that he is an Australian national, to whom Australia owes obligations of primary concern and protection from unnecessarily undergoing extradition. (ii) The effect of ongoing proceedings and imprisonment on Mr Zentai, having regard to the fact that he is 88 years of age and suffers from a serious and debilitating medical condition. (iii) That the Minister, in discharge of Australia's international responsibilities under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 ( ICCPR ), cannot reasonably be satisfied that the Republic of Hungary would be able to afford Mr Zentai a fair trial, in accordance with international standards. In particular, the request for extradition is based on depositions made by persons in proceedings in the (then Communist) Hungarian Peoples' Court in the late 1940's. If tried, Mr Zentai could not, as required by Art 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950 ( ECHR ) and Art 14 ICCPR, confront and examine witnesses as to the veracity and voluntariness of their confessions. Mr Zentai has asked whether the Hungarian prosecution authorities are able to produce for cross-examination the deponents on whose statements the Hungarian authorities would rely to found any prosecution. No such information has been provided by the Republic of Hungary, nor has the Australian Government sought any assurances as to how a fair trial can be conducted in the absence of these principal witnesses. Given that deficiency, it is said, the onus falls on the Australian Government to establish how it can surrender Mr Zentai for extradition to Hungary for investigation in Hungary if the Hungarian Government is unable to assure it that any criminal proceedings could and would be fairly conducted. (iv) The fact that Mr Zentai may be prejudiced at any future trial on the grounds of his nationality or political opinions by reason of bias on the part of the Hungarian People's Court in 1948 when it issued a warrant for his arrest. Relevance of Australia's international treaty obligations A relevant consideration is the obligation of Australia to comply with extradition treaty arrangements. However, that obligation is not an absolute one, but subject to the qualifying provisions of the Extradition Treaty, either requiring or permitting Australia to refuse extradition in particular circumstances, which (as the grounds for review explain) apply in this case. It is argued that if the grounds for review were made out, then the surrender of Mr Zentai to extradition would be unlawful and Australia would be in breach of its international obligations to one of its nationals, by denying him the benefit of Art 2 para 5 and para 3(1)(f)(ii) of the Extradition Treaty. Arguability and unresolved nature of outstanding objections In the circumstances of this application, the fact that some of the grounds go to the fundamental lawfulness of the extradition request place them in a special category, as compared with appeal grounds which go to matters such as procedural or evidentiary flaws in the process of a magistrate determining eligibility for surrender under s 19 of the Extradition Act . These unresolved grounds of objection, in contrast to the usual position following determinations under s 19 and s 21 of the Extradition Act may well, with other features of Mr Zentai's circumstances, constitute 'special circumstances'. Article 3 paragraph 2 of the Extradition Treaty There are basically three limbs to Mr Zentai's claim that various circumstances constitute injustice, oppression, are incompatible with humanitarian considerations, or entail too severe a punishment, within the meaning of Art 3 para 2. The first concerns the state of Mr Zentai's health and age - also a relevant consideration for this Court when entertaining this bail application with regard to special or exceptional circumstances. The second consideration is the capacity of the Military Division of the Budapest Metropolitan Court to provide fair procedures to determine Mr Zentai could be guilty of the alleged offence in November 1944. It is argued that this is an international obligation, both of the Republic of Hungary, under Art 8 ECHR and Australia under Art 14 ICCPR. Australia is a party to the latter including the two protocols to the Covenant. Hungary is bound by the former. It is argued for Mr Zentai that whereas breach of the ECHR is essentially a matter for the Republic of Hungary and may result ultimately, if Mr Zentai were ever put on trial, in litigation before the European Court of Human Rights, breach of the ICCPR immediately confronts Australia with its international law obligation to Mr Zentai not to extradite him in breach of the ICCPR and the Extradition Treaty. Further, Art 9 ICCPR entitles Mr Zentai to his liberty subject only to procedures established by law. The liberty of the subject is a significant aspect not only regarding this objection but also generally to the overall context of this bail application. A third alleged aspect of oppression falling within Art 3(2)(f) is the fact that under the Hungarian Criminal Code the apparently mandatory minimum sentence for the offence of war crimes is 10 years. That, in the case of someone of Mr Zentai's age is a virtual life sentence. Finally, if bail is not granted, Mr Zentai, who is 88 years of age, would be likely to remain in prison for some considerable time. That is a further 'special circumstance', together with his deteriorating medical condition, which his continued incarceration is likely to exacerbate. CONCLUSION In my view, there is a serious question to be tried. Equally, for reasons indicated above, I am satisfied that this is an exceptional case and that bail should be granted. I note also that bail is not opposed. This is also significant, given the importance of Australia's treaty obligations, a factor which most certainly would not have escaped the first and second respondents. Accordingly, the following orders will be made: Pursuant to section 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and Order 4 Rule 9 of the Federal Court Rules that both the warrant issued by the Third Respondent, a Magistrate of the State of Western Australia dated 20 August 2008 pursuant to section 19(9) of the Extradition Act 1988 (Act), committing the Applicant to imprisonment in Hakea Prison, Canning Vale, Western Australia; and the surrender warrant issued by the First Respondent under section 23 of the Act on 12 November 2009 authorising the Officer in Charge of Hakea Prison (Fourth Respondent) to release the Applicant into the custody of officers of the Republic of Hungary, be stayed until further order of the Court and that the Applicant after complying with the conditions set out in Schedule 1 to this Order, be released on bail with a duty to surrender to the Federal Court of Australia upon the order of the Federal Court of Australia on a date and time to be notified to the Applicant by an officer of the Federal Court of Australia. Schedule 1 Pursuant to section 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 and Order 4 Rule 9 of the Federal Court Rules the Applicant be released on bail on the following terms and conditions: $50,000.00 personal undertaking; $75,000.00 surety; Surrender all passports and not apply for any passports; Not to approach within 100 metres of any point of the domestic or international departure and not to leave Australia; and Reside at 2/10 Millar Place, Willetton, WA.

The applicant's claim is one for compensation arising out of alleged breaches of a contract of employment and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in connection with the respondent's termination of the applicant's employment. The respondent seeks an order that the applicant attend a medical examination. The applicant does not agree to do so. The following circumstances are relevant. First, the applicant served a report from a consulting psychologist with respect to the applicant's current medical condition; the applicant, however, does not intend to rely on this report (see [4] below). Second, the applicant has given evidence on oath in an affidavit about his feelings concerning and consequential upon the termination of his employment. The respondent submits that it should be granted an order that the applicant attend a medical examination because this evidence is potentially relevant in at least three ways. First, the respondent says that the evidence is potentially relevant to the valuation of the applicant's claim for the loss of the chance to have continued in employment for the respondent until retiring age. Second, the respondent says that the evidence is potentially relevant to its defence based on provisions of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (NSW) and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (Cth) which preclude claims for damages in respect of an injury sustained by an employee in the course of his or her employment. Third, the respondent says the evidence is potentially relevant to the question of whether the applicant has mitigated his loss, by seeking or obtaining alternative employment. The difficulty I have with the application is that the applicant has made no claim in these proceedings for any damages arising from an injury, be that injury physical or psychological. In circumstances where there is no positive claim by the applicant for any such damage, it does not seem to me that it is a reasonable requirement that, at the suit of the applicant's former employer, the applicant be required to attend a medical examination. The mere fact that the employer happens to be in possession of a medical report does not place this matter in any category different from any other application. This is because the applicant's counsel has made it clear beyond any doubt that the medical report is not relevant to any of the claims in the proceedings. It was obtained and served at a time when the applicant was contemplating an amendment to the statement of claim to include a claim for injury. However, no such claim is to be made in the proceedings and the applicant therefore does not propose to tender the medical report. In these circumstances, none of the grounds upon which the respondent said the evidence is potentially relevant arise. In short, I accept the applicant's submission that any evidence that is in the applicant's affidavit about his feelings in respect of the termination of his employment cannot be taken as evidence that he is, in fact, suffering from any form of medical condition or injury and, accordingly, could not be used for that purpose. In these circumstances, as the proceedings are presently constituted, there is no proper basis upon which I could or would require the applicant to attend a medical examination against his will.

This involves the proper construction of s 12DL of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) . THE FACTUAL CONTEXT (a) Handycards Westpac Banking Corporation is one of the larger banks in Australia. In early 2009 it had on issue to its customers and their nominees over 2,500,000 debit cards, called Westpac Handycards. Westpac first issued Handycards in the early 1980s as a proprietary debit card. These were used to access funds in a customer's account with Westpac. Handycards are always used by the cardholder entering a personal identification number, known as a \"PIN\", into either an Australian electronic funds transfer point of sale (known as \"EFTPOS\") machine or terminal or into an automatic teller machine (known as an \"ATM\") both domestically and internationally. Ordinarily, when a customer uses his or her Handycard in an EFTPOS or ATM transaction, he or she is linked, through computer networks, into his or her account at Westpac. The customer then uses his or her PIN and draws on funds within, either, a credit balance or an approved overdraft limit to pay a supplier at its premises using EFTPOS, for goods or services or to obtain cash using either EFTPOS or an ATM. The Handycards work in ATMs internationally because they function on the Cirrus system. This is a global ATM system operated by the MasterCard group. Cirrus links more than 20,000 financial institutions through 1.5 million ATMs in over 210 countries. (b) Debit MasterCards Westpac identified about 900,000 of its Handycard customers who had a higher propensity to use their card in EFTPOS transactions. It decided to substitute a new card for those customers' Handycards. This was to be a Westpac Debit MasterCard. Westpac began sending the new card to its existing customers in early February 2009. It wrote telling them that the Handycard would expire and would be replaced with the new card that was enclosed. The letters differed depending on whether the Handycard was close to expiring in the ordinary course. Each letter enclosed a product disclosure statement for the new card dated 1 December 2008. The new card allows the customer to do what he or she did with their Handycard. However, the new card also has additional functions and can be used to access the customer's account in different ways to those with a Handycard. The Commission asserts that these differences mean that the new card is not \"a card of the same kind\" as the Handycard. The consequence of this argument is that Westpac will have committed criminal offences by sending debit cards to the over 424,000 Handycard holders who had received the new card by late May 2009. The Commission had first raised a concern of a possible contravention of s 12DL in a letter it sent to Westpac on 12 May 2009. After this the parties engaged in correspondence and meetings. Ultimately, on 6 August 2009, the Commission wrote to Westpac with the accusation that distribution of the new card to Westpac's Handybank customers \"... is a clear breach of s 12DL ...\". Westpac brought these proceedings seeking declarations that, in effect, what it had done was not a contravention of s 12DL. Following a number of directions hearings in which the Commission sought to identify the precise contravention of s 12DL that it alleged, it filed a cross-claim that pleaded the matters on which it relied. Westpac's defence to the cross claim narrowed the substance of the factual dispute which I will summarise below. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A HANDYCARD AND A DEBIT MASTERCARD Two detailed affidavits were made by Scott Southall, Westpac's general manager, deposits, cards and merchants. These explained the operation of the two types of card and the individual and commercial contexts in which they are used. Mr Southall also set out the evolutionary development of functionality and applications for the two types of card that has occurred in response to developments in technology, regulation, financial and banking systems. He explained, for example, that in 1980 when ATMs were first used, a cardholder could only gain access to his or her account by using an ATM of the card issuer. This is a constraint on usage unrecognisable in today's world. Now, banks and other financial networks, including MasterCard, have established linkages and networks that give cardholders of one issuing financial institution access to their accounts on ATMs and EFTPOS machines including those of many other financial institutions throughout Australia, and to many ATMs internationally. Mr Southall said that payment systems are continually evolving. There is no factual dispute about the differences between the functions of the Handycard and those of the new card. The real issue is the proper construction of s 12DL in light of these differences. The differences are: (1) the standards prescribed for each of the EFTPOS and the ATM networks differed from the standards to which the MasterCard network was subject; (2) if the customer uses a Handycard, Westpac must pay the merchant an interchange fee of up to about 5¢ per transaction for accessing the EFTPOS network. In contrast, if the customer uses the new card for the same purpose, the merchant, through its financial institution, must pay Westpac 12¢ per transaction; (3) the new card can be used by the holder in the following additional ways that the Handycard cannot: (a) to access the MasterCard network in Australia and internationally; (b) to access his or her account without the cardholder being personally present with, or having the card with him or her, while entering his or her PIN into an EFTPOS or ATM machine. In particular the new card can be used by the customer in postal communications, by telephone and online; (c) to exceed an upper daily transaction limit when it is used on an EFTPOS terminal linked to the MasterCard network, when a MasterCard merchant processes a transaction manually, and for certain interest fees and charges. However, the Handycard can also be used to exceed that limit at an EFTPOS terminal if a terminal or communications system is not working. Difference (1) --- Standards While there is a difference in standards governing the two cards, the Commission did not contend that this was of any present significance. The Australian ATM system comprises a series of bilateral communications links between financial institutions. The Australian Payments Clearing Association Ltd, known as \"APCA\" administers the regulatory and standards framework for both the EFTPOS network and the Australian ATM system. The EFTPOS debit card system, like a number of other financial systems that affect the operation of both cards, is regulated by the Reserve Bank of Australia. It is designated as a payment system under the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 (Cth). In June 2008 Philip Low, the Assistant Governor (Financial Systems) of the Reserve Bank flagged the need for the financial system industry to consider changes to the EFTPOS system, including developing alternative payment methods for use in online payments so as to create \"... an effective competitor to the international card schemes\". The Reserve Bank has determined an access scheme and standards to set interchange fees for that system. The MasterCard debit card system is not directly subject to the Reserve Bank's EFTPOS access scheme and standards. However, MasterCard has provided the Reserve Bank with an undertaking governing the use of a debit MasterCard card, on terms that the Commission has not suggested creates any substantive difference. Westpac customers can use the new card in the same way as they did with their Handycards to access the EFTPOS system, ATMs and their existing Westpac accounts. However, they can also access additional outlets with the new card and can do so in different ways. And the Handycards can be used at any overseas ATM that is linked to MasterCard's global network. Difference (2) --- Interchange fees The Commission does not assert that the difference in incidence of interchange fees caused any change of merchant behaviour (such as passing on the fee). But, it claims that this cost transfer creates a future potential to increase the cost of the new card to the cardholder (XC par 6b). In late November 2009, the Reserve Bank announced that it had decided to amend the EFTPOS interchange fees standard. The Reserve Bank stated that this would introduce a standard cap on the weighted average of any multilateral interchange fees (such as apply to the new card) in the EFTPOS system at the same level of 12 cents per transaction as applied to the scheme governing debit card payment systems such as MasterCard's. The Reserve Bank left the bilateral interchange fee payable to the acquirer (ie merchant) unchanged at 4 to 5 cents per transaction. The Reserve Bank said that those charges were \"... intended to facilitate and stimulate competition between EFTPOS and the scheme debit systems\". Difference (3) --- Greater Access There is no question that the new card offers the customer a significantly increased number of circumstances in which he or she can use a debit card to gain access to his or her account. Additionally, the new card is accepted by more merchants and in more locations than the Handycard, and overseas merchants do not accept Handycards. Difference (4) --- Card not present transactions The Commission argues that because the new card can be used to access the cardholder's account without him or her being present, and without using the PIN, the cardholder is more vulnerable to a third party, such as a member of a family or household, misusing the card and committing a fraud on the cardholder. The Commission asserted that because someone other than the cardholder could use the new card over the telephone, in a letter or on the internet, a key feature of, and protection offered by, the Handycard was not available with the new card. It claimed that the need for a Handycard holder to use the card at an EFTPOS machine or ATM with a PIN was a safeguard. In contrast, the new card can also be used without the cardholder being present (e.g. by writing its details in a letter, giving them over the telephone or entering them in an online transaction). The Commission said the new card thus increased the risk of fraud to which the cardholder could be exposed. It argued that the purpose of s 12DL was to prevent a cardholder, who had not made a prior request for it in writing, being given such a card because it was not \"of the same kind\". Westpac's product disclosure statements set out the terms and conditions governing its and its personal customer's rights and liabilities for deposit accounts. These have applied in the past and continue to apply to the use of means of access such as both Handycards and, now, the new card. The product disclosure statements stated that Westpac had the right to change the terms and conditions that applied to the customer's accounts and \"your account access channels (e.g. Telephone Banking, Internet Banking, Handycard access etc)\". These also required the cardholder to notify Westpac immediately if their card or PIN record were lost or stolen or they suspected that unauthorised transactions had been made on any account. Importantly, the terms and conditions applicable to both a Handycard and a Debit MasterCard card provided that the cardholder would not be liable for losses resulting from unauthorised transactions where it was clear that the cardholder had not contributed to the loss. As Mr Southall explained, the effect of all the terms and conditions allocating contractual liability for unauthorised transactions involving use of a Handycard and a Debit MasterCard is substantively the same. THE STATUTORY SCHEME The provisions of s 12DL are critical to the resolution of these proceedings. It is contained in Pt 2 Div 2 of the Act within subdivision D which is headed \"Consumer protection\". The section provides: \"12DL Unsolicited credit cards and debit cards (1) A person must not send another person (the targeted person ) a credit card or a debit card except in accordance with subsection (2). Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see section 12GB). (2) A person may send the targeted person the card: (a) in pursuance of a request in writing by the person (the liable person ) who will be under a liability to the issuer of the card in respect of the use of the card; or (b) in renewal or replacement of, or in substitution for: (i) a card of the same kind previously sent to the targeted person in pursuance of a request in writing by the liable person to the issuer of the previous card; or (ii) a card of the same kind previously sent to the targeted person and used for a purpose for which it was intended to be used. Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in this subsection, see subsection 13.3(3) of the Criminal Code . (3) Subsection (1) applies only in relation to the sending of a card by or on behalf of the issuer of the card. (4) A person must not take any action that enables: (a) another person who has a credit card to use the card as a debit card; or (b) another person who has a debit card to use the card as a credit card; except in accordance with a request in writing by the other person. Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see section 12GB). (4A) An offence under subsection 12GB(1) relating to subsection (1) or (4) of this section is an offence of strict liability. Note: For strict liability , see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code . (5) In this section: article includes a token, card or document. credit card means an article that: (a) is of a kind described in one or more of the following subparagraphs: (i) an article of a kind commonly known as a credit card; (ii) a similar article intended for use in obtaining cash, goods or services on credit; (iii) an article of a kind that persons carrying on business commonly issue to their customers or prospective customers for use in obtaining goods or services from those persons on credit; and (b) is part of, or provides access to, a credit facility that is a financial product; or an article that may be used as an article referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b). debit card means: (a) an article intended for use by a person in obtaining access to an account that is: (i) held by the person for the purpose of withdrawing or depositing cash or obtaining goods or services; and (ii) a financial product; or (b) an article that may be used as an article referred to in paragraph (a). \" THE COMMISSION'S CASE The Commission argued that because s 12DL is in a subdivision of the Act headed \"Consumer protection\" it should be construed purposively from that perspective. It argued that the section afforded protection to consumers by prohibiting persons sending them credit or debit cards that had not been requested by the consumer in writing. The Commission contended that s 12DL(2)(b)(ii) should be construed narrowly because it permitted a person to send renewed, replaced or substitute cards without that safeguard of a request in writing. It contended that this view also was supported by earlier, repealed predecessors of s 12DL. The Commission accepted that because a card could be sent in substitution for another of the same kind, the substitute did not have to be identical with the original card. But, it argued that the words \"of the same kind\" in s 12DL(2) should be construed as meaning \"substantially of the same nature or type\" following the view of Young J on that expression as used in s 4(1) of the Futures Industry (NSW) Code in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Lombard Nash International Pty Ltd (1986) 11 ACLR 566 at 569-570. The Commission argued that the word \"kind\" in s 12DL(2) did not relate back to just whether the card was a credit card or a debit card. This was because, it said, the definitions in s 12DL(5) did not create a bright line distinction between the two terms; indeed each card could have features of the other within their defined meanings. Thus, the Commission contended, one had to consider the functionality of each card in order to ascertain whether the cards were \"of the same kind\". This was a question of fact and degree. The Commission argued that the functionality of a Handycard was more limited than the new card. It said that the Handycard was used in a straightforward, simple manner requiring personal presence of the card holder and the use of his or her PIN to access the person's account at only two types of entry points, namely on EFTPOS or ATM machines. The Commission argued that this functionality was substantively different in kind to the broader range offered by the new card. It argued that because the new card could access different payment systems and be used by mail, over the telephone or on the internet, the risk of its unauthorised use was greater than that for a Handycard. It contended that these features amounted to a difference in kind. CONSIDERATION The construction of s 12DL must be approached having regard to its dual operation as a section that imposes both criminal and civil liability for a contravention of either s 12DL(1) or (4). The heading to the subdivision in the Act of which s 12DL forms part is headed \"Consumer protection\". That heading provides part of the context in which the substantive provisions of Subdiv D of Div 2 of Pt 2 of the Act must be construed: s 13 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth). The heading should be taken into consideration in determining the meaning of those sections in cases of ambiguity. However, as Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ cautioned in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17 ; (1990) 169 CLR 594 at 601, the heading does not control the permissible scope of the substantive provisions within the subdivision in the Act. The heading cannot properly be used to impose an unnaturally constricted or expanded meaning upon the words of those substantive provisions: cf Concrete Constructions 169 CLR at 601-602, 603-604. Another important contextual feature that must be considered in construing s 12DL is its imposition of strict criminal liability for a contravention of each of s 12DL(1) or (4). This feature cautions against (but does not always exclude) the adoption of an expansive construction of narrower, but clear words. However, as Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ said in Stevens v Kabushiki Kaisha Sony Computer Entertainment [2005] HCA 58 ; (2005) 224 CLR 193 at 210-211 [45] : \"... in choosing between a relatively broad and a relatively narrow construction of legislation, it is desirable to take into account its penal character. The present litigation does not arise from the institution of criminal proceedings under the offence provisions now contained particularly in s 132 of the Act. However, a person who makes or sells a circumvention device (s 132(5B)) is liable to imprisonment for not more than five years (s 132(6A)). An appreciation of the heavy hand that may be brought down by the criminal law suggests the need for caution in accepting any loose, albeit \"practical\", construction of Div 2A itself. \" (emphasis added) The initial prohibition in s 12DL(1) applies to an issuer of a card (by dint of s 12DL(3)) sending one or other of the two cards defined in s 12DL(5), unless the person sends the card in accordance with s 12DL(2). When the chapeau to s 12DL(2) refers to \"the card\", it identifies the particular card sent to which s 12DL(1) applies. That is, \"the card\" in the chapeau to s 12DL(2) is either one or other of a credit card or a debit card as defined in s 12DL(5). A significant feature of s 12DL(2)(b)(ii) is that the card sent may be in renewal, or replacement of, or in substitution for, \"a card of the same kind\" that has two other characteristics; first, that \"a card of the same kind\" had been sent previously to the person concerned and, secondly, it (the last mentioned card) had been used for \"a purpose for which it was intended to be used\". The three purposes specified at the commencement of para (b) in s 12DL(2) must each be given a distinct meaning and operation. This is because the Court must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision and construe it, if possible, so as to give effect to harmonious goals: Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at 381-382 [69]-[71] per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. A renewal of a card ordinarily will occur close to the expiry date of the credit or debit card. By renewing the card, the issuer creates a new expiry date for the card. A replacement card ordinarily would be one sent to take the place of a card that had been lost by or stolen from the cardholder. A card in substitution for an existing card is different, again, from a renewed or replacement card. A substitute is not normally an exact replica. Often a substitute will have different characteristics, even though it will be able to take the place of the original. The Oxford English Dictionary defines \"substitution\" as including \"the putting of one ... thing in place of another\" and \"replacement (of one thing) by another\". Suppose that on renewal, a renewed debit card has a significant new security feature offering the cardholder extra protection that the expired debit card did not have. Or suppose that because of improvements in technology a completely new payment system allowed the renewed card to be used in many more locations, but with the same security features as the expiring card. If the Commission's contentions were correct, the presence of the new security feature or the functionality with the new payment system would mean that the card was not \"of the same kind\" as the expiring card. I reject that argument. The expression \"of the same kind\" does not require that the previous and later cards are absolutely identical. A retail business will replace or substitute new goods for those it has sold. Sometimes suppliers of such goods discontinue production of a particular good or go out of business. The trader will often seek a replacement or substitute good that has some identity or characteristic in common with the unavailable product. The new good may be an improved version of the old with more functions or features, perhaps having shed others: cf the discussion in the dissenting judgments of Stephen J and Aickin J in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v St Hubert's Island Pty Ltd (In Liq) [1978] HCA 10 ; (1978) 138 CLR 210 at 218 and 242-243. The context and the characteristics or properties of the original and the substitute can assist in ascertaining whether what is put forward is truly a substitution for what was originally there. Usually, it will be a question of fact whether a substitution or something more radical has occurred in a given case. In competition law, s 4E of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) provides a definition of a market as including a market for the particular goods or services under consideration \"and other goods or services that are substitutable for ...\" the former. Yet, the mere fact that a consumer will on occasion purchase tea instead of coffee does not necessarily mean that because of that substitution tea and coffee cannot be distinct goods with their own separate markets. On the other hand, it maybe that, if the relevant market is the hot beverage market, they will be substitutes; hence the importance of the context in which substitution is assessed: cp Arnotts Ltd v Trade Practices Commission (1990) 24 FCR 313 at 332 per Lockhart, Wilcox and Gummow JJ; Queensland Wire Industries Pty Ltd v Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd [1989] HCA 6 ; (1989) 167 CLR 177 at 188 per Mason CJ and Wilson J. The three purposes for which a new card may be sent under s 12DL(2)(b) are qualified by the requirements in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) that it be \"a card of the same kind previously sent to the targeted person\", with one of the two further qualifications given in each provision. Those two further qualifications operate in two different scenarios. In s 12DL(2)(b)(i) the person liable to the issuer of the previous card (e.g. Westpac's customer) must have made a request in writing to the issuer to send the person that (previous) card. The recipient of the previous card could be both the customer or a cardholder nominated by the customer (such as a spouse, partner or child). This qualification requires that the customer and other recipient have a pre-existing relationship established by an earlier request in writing from the customer for the previous card. These relationships may have existed for many years, and may have originated before s 12DL and its statutory predecessors applied to it so it may be that no such written request exists. One evident purpose of s 12DL(2)(b)(ii) is to cater for an existing consensual relationship. It provides that the previous card actually must have been used for a purpose for which it was intended to be used. So, if a cardholder nominated by a customer has used the previous card appropriately, that use will create a sufficient relationship with the issuer to justify the sending of the later card. Importantly, the use made of the previous card does not have to exhaust or cover the range of functions or features of the card; one use or one method of use for the permitted purpose is all that s 12DL(2)(b)(ii) requires. The concept of use of a card also relates to the definitions of credit and debit cards in s 12DL(5). Those definitions are very broad and, partly, draw upon the ordinary English meaning of a credit card and a debit card. A credit card is used to borrow from or create a debt to the issuer for which the customer is liable. When a use of a credit card creates a liability of the customer, he or she will also become liable to the issuer for interest on the funds that the customer has obtained on credit. In contrast, a debit card is used to obtain access to the customer's own money held or owed by the issuer. The definitions of each type of card also include a card \"that may be used as [a card] referred to\" in the prior parts of the definition. This is a significant indication in s 12DL that individual uses within the range of uses to which a particular card may be put are different from the \"kind\" of card that is referred to in s 12DL(2)(b)(i) and (ii). However, as s 12DL(4) recognises, it is possible to use a credit card as a debit card and vice versa. That subsection prohibits any person, (not just the issuer of the card affected by the operation of s 12DL(1), (2) and (3)), from transforming the capacity of the particular card to be used into, or so as to include use as, a card of the other kind unless the cardholder (not just the customer or person liable) makes a request to the person in writing. This protective function, prevents a significant addition of a very different use that would change the defining characteristic of the operation of the card without the cardholder making a written request for that change. Of course, if such a change has been authorised, a card that can be used dually as a credit and debit card, will be able to be renewed, replaced or substituted by sending the cardholder \"a card of the same kind\" as referred to in s 12DL(2)(b). The Commission also relied in support of its narrow construction of \"a card of the same kind\" on earlier and significantly different versions of s 12DL in which that expression appeared in a subsection similar to the present s 12DL(2). The earlier versions created an offence in s 12DL(1) only in respect of debit cards and \"an article that may be used as a debit card of that kind \". The emphasised words have no counterpart in the present s 12DL. I reject this argument. First, the predecessor versions of s 12DL had significantly different wording and operated differently. Secondly, because s 12DL in its present form is different to the previous versions, the relevant task of statutory construction is to construe the section as it now is. The previous wordings were in respect of differently expressed provisions, including the repealed offence created in the former version of s 12DL(1): cf McNamara v Consumer Trader and Tenancy Tribunal [2005] HCA 55 ; (2005) 221 CLR 646 at 661 [40] per McHugh, Gummow and Heydon JJ, Gleeson CJ agreeing at 650 [1]. Thirdly, I am of opinion that the language of the present s 12DL is clear and the earlier versions do not elucidate its meaning. Fourthly, the earlier version of s 12DL(1) expressly referred to two separate types of debit card including one being \"a debit card of the same kind\" which may have had a relationship to the expression \"card of the same kind\" as then used in s 12DL(2). In addition, there was also a definition of \"debit card\". The absence in the present s 12DL of the expression \"a debit card of that kind\" demonstrates the irrelevance of the earlier legislation to the construction of the Act in its present form. The Commission also relied on complaint logs to argue that the new card was not regarded by Westpac's customers as a card of the same kind as their Handycard. A total of 740 complaints was recorded although it is not clear whether one complainant could have had more than one complaint recorded. In any event, the total number of complaints is inconsequential having regard to the fact that over 420,000 new cards were issued, the last over six months ago. Next the Commission relied on what it asserted were differences in reported fraudulent use of all Westpac debit cards in relation to the category \"card not present\" in the 12 quarters to September 2009. The Commission did not put forward any analysis to make good its assertion that this material was probative of the new card not being a card of the same kind as the Handycard. As a percentage of the total amount spent on the cards, the incidence of this fraudulent use varied quarter by quarter within a range, while the overall spending has been significantly increasing. The first three quarters in 2008 and 2009 show broadly similar percentages although they are all slightly less for 2009. In contrast the incidence of fraudulent use of a PIN is very much smaller. More importantly, in the \"card not present\" figures, the highest recorded total of fraudulent transactions was about $250,000 in the March 2009 quarter in respect of over $250 million worth of \"card not present\" transactions. In the succeeding two quarters the total corresponding figures for fraudulent transactions declined to about $180,000 of a total spend of over $410 million in the third quarter. I am unable to understand how these figures demonstrate that the new cards are not cards of the same kind as the Handycards the customers formerly held. The incidence of fraudulent use when a card was not present appears to be trivial in relation to the overall use of debit cards in this type of transaction. CONCLUSION I am of opinion that the defining characteristic of each \"kind\" of card in s 12DL(2) is the ability to use it for one particular purpose, whatever other functions or purposes it may have. That defining characteristic is either to obtain credit from the issuer for which the customer will be liable or to obtain access to the customer's funds from the issuer. The former characteristic means that the card is a credit card, the latter that it is a debit card. Additionally, the construction of s 12DL(2) favoured by the Commission would broaden the scope of the strict liability offence created by s 12DL(1) in a manner that strains the natural and ordinary meaning of \"a card of the same kind\" as referring to one or other of the two cards referred to in s 12DL(1). This invites a more cautious approach to the looser construction of this criminal provision than the Commission's contention: Stevens 224 CLR at 210-211 [45]; Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Ltd [2000] HCA 7 ; (2000) 199 CLR 321 at 338 [34] - [35] per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ; and see too R v Adams [1935] HCA 62 ; (1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-568 where Rich, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ said: \"No doubt, in determining whether an offence has been created or enlarged, the Court must be guided, as in other questions of interpretation, by the fair meaning of the language of the enactment, but when that language is capable of more than one meaning, or is vague or cloudy so that its denotation is uncertain and no sure conclusion can be reached by a consideration of the provisions and subject matter of the legislation, then it ought not to be construed as extending any penal category . \" (emphasis added) Here, each of the Handycard and the new card (the debit MasterCard card) is a debit card within the meaning of s 12DL(5). Each card is intended for use by a person to obtain access to an account he or she (or the person who nominated him or her to receive the card) holds for the purpose of withdrawing cash or obtaining goods or services. A person who has received a new card from Westpac will be able to use it at least for all the purposes he or she used the earlier Handycard. I am of opinion that the extra functionality permitting use by mail, telephone and on the internet and the wider range of places at which the new card may be used, whether considered individually or together, do not change or deny the nature of the new card as a debit card. The new card is, in the natural and ordinary meaning of s 12DL(2)(b), a card of the same kind as the Handycard. And, it offers contractual protection of the customer from misuse of the card by others of the same kind as the Handycard. This is because the terms of the product disclosure statements so provide. There is no lessening of the protection of consumers intended by the Parliament provided by this construction. The Parliament sought to guard against them being sent a credit card or a debit that they had never sought. But, it was not the intention of the Act to constrain the relationship between an issuer of a card and its customer by preventing the issuer updating the particular kind of card (i.e. a credit or debit card) with the latest version of that kind of card. The more is this likely given the context in which s 12DL has taken its present form of a period of rapid technological growth and the continuing evolution of financial systems. For these reasons, I am of opinion that Westpac is entitled to relief and that the Commission's cross-claim fails. I have in mind making a declaration and orders to the following effect: (a) Declare that: 1. By sending a Westpac Debit MasterCard card to its existing Handycard holders who had used their Handycard for a purpose for which it was intended to be used, the applicant sent each such cardholder the Debit MasterCard card in renewal or replacement of, or in substitution for, a card of the same kind previously sent to him or her, being the person's Handycard, for the purposes, and within the meaning, of s 12DL of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth). (b) Order that: 2. The cross-claim be dismissed. However, I will give the parties the opportunity to consider whether these are appropriate and sufficient having regard to my reasons. The parties should bring in short minutes of order so that I can grant final relief in the most appropriate form. I certify that the preceding forty-nine (49) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.
