The full $500,000.00 modification fee was provided to DEFENDANTS as\r\npayment toward PLAINTIFFS’ monthly mortgage payments. However, DEFENDANTS have\r\nrefused and continue to refuse to credit the account of MARIAM, KAM-RON, and 8950 MEMORY\r\nPARK for the amount of the modification fee even though they are in possession of the $500,000.00.\r\nThough the mortgage balance is current.

DEFENDANTS ’ represented to PLAINTIFF that the mortgage\r\nloan would be provided in exchange for PLAINTIFFS ’ agreement to make monthly payments on the\r\nloan. DEFENDANTS further represented that payments made by PLAINTIFFS would be credited\r\ntoward the Loan pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement. DEFENDANTS further represented\r\nthat DEFENDANTS would invest and distribute payments made by PLAINTIFFS toward\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ mortgage balance.\r\n72.\tBased on Defendants’ representations, on or about March2007, PLAINTIFFS agreed\r\nto obtain a secured mortgage loan from DEFENDANTS and their predecessors in interest in the\r\namount of approximately$9,000,000.00. Attached as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of the\r\nwritten Loan Agreement.\r\n73.\tIn December 2009' a tenant modified its lease at the Property. The tenant paid a\r\n$500,000.00 modification fee (the “Modification Fee”) to PLAINTIFFS in order to lease a smaller\r\nportion of the Property than it had leased prior to the modification.\r\n74.\tPursuant to Paragraph 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, all rents from ail non-residential\r\ntenants at the Property were to be paid directly to the lender. At all times relevant herein, this\r\nprovision required that rents from all non-residential tenants be paid directly to DEFENDANT\r\nBANK OF AMERICA.\r\n75.\tPursuant to Paragraph 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, the Modification Fee was provided\r\nto DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA\r\nFINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. by PLAINTIFFS. The Modification Fee was provided in four\r\nseparate payments: $250,000.00, $200,000.00, $40,000.00, and $28,000.00. The final two payments\r\n \nY:\\My FilcsVP&AMCay CoNMehdizadch v.

All four payments were to be applied toward Plaintiffs’ monthly mortgage payments.\r\nAttached as Exhibit C are true and correct copies of the $518,000.00 in payments. The checks in the\r\namounts of $250,000.00 and $200,000.00 were made payable from the tenant to PLAINTIFFS and\r\nwere provided directly to DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and\r\nWACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC., which regularly processed tenant payment checks\r\nmade payable to PLAINTIFFS by applying the amount of the checks toward PLAINTIFFS ’\r\nmortgage.\t.\r\n76.\tDespite DEFENDANTS’ representation that they would credit PLAINTIFFS’\r\npayments pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, DEFENDANTS have failed to properly\r\ncredit PLAINTIFFS MARIAM, KAM-RON, and 8950 MEMORY PARK for the $518,000.00 in\r\npayments that were made by PLAINTIFF.\r\n77.\tDespite DEFENDANTS’ representation that they would invest and distribute\r\npayments made by PLAINTIFFS toward PLAINTIFFS’ mortgage balance, DEFENDANTS have\r\nfailed to invest and distribute such funds.\r\n78.\tInstead, DEFENDANTS have begun to institute foreclosure proceedings.\r\n79.\tBeginning on or about March 9, 2010, DEFENDANTS initiated foreclosure\r\nproceedings on the Property.

If the applicable\r\nlaw (state or federal) is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for\r\nunder the Note or any other Loan Document, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or\r\nreceived with respect to the Debt, or if Lender’s exercise of the option to accelerate die maturity\r\nof the Loan or any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in\r\nexcess of that permitted by applicable law, that it is Borrower’s and Lender’s express intent that\r\nall excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender shall be credited against die unpaid Principal\r\nand all other Debt (or, if die Debt has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to\r\nBorrower), and the provisions of the Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the\r\namounts thereafter collectible thereunder reduced, without die necessity of the execution of any\r\nnew document, so as to comply with applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of die\r\nfullest amount otherwise called for thereunder.

The Loan Documents are solely for the benefit of\r\nLender and Borrower and nothing contained in any Loan Document shall be deemed to confer\r\nupon anyone other than the Lender and Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the\r\nperformance or observance of any of the obligations contained therein.\r\n10.20\tYield Maintenance Premium. Borrower acknowledges that (a) Lender is\r\nmaking the Loan in consideration of the receipt by Lender of all interest and other benefits\r\nintended to be conferred by the Loan Documents that is not prepayable prior to the Stated\r\nMaturity Date and (b) if payments of Principal are made to Lender prior to the regularly\r\nscheduled due date for such payment, for any reason whatsoever, including as a-result of\r\nLender’s acceleration of die Loan after an Event of Default, by operation of law or otherwise.\r\nLender will not receive all such interest and other benefits and may, in addition, incur costs. For\r\nthese reasons, and to induce Lender to make die Loan, Borrower expressly waives any right or\r\nprivilege to prepay the Loan except as otherwise may be specifically permitted herein and agrees\r\nthat, except as expressly provided in Sections 2.3.4 and 7.4.2, all prepayments, if any, will be .\r\naccompanied by die Yield Maintenance Premium. Such Yield Maintenance Premium shall be\r\nrequired whether payment is made by Borrower, by a Person on behalf of Borrower, or by die\r\npurchaser at any foreclosure sale, and may be included in any bid by Lender at such sale.\r\nBorrower further acknowledges that (A) it is a knowledgeable real estate developer and/or\r\ninvestor; (B) it fUUy understands the effect of the provisions of this Section 10.20, as well as the\r\nother provisions of the Loan Documents; (C) the making of the Loan by Lender at the Interest\r\nRate and other terms set forth in the Loan Documents are sufficient consideration for Borrower’s\r\nobligation to pay a Yield Maintenance Premium (if required); and (D) Lender would not make\r\nthe Loan on die terms set forth herein without the inclusion of such provisions. Borrower also\r\nacknowledges that the provisions of this Agreement limiting the right of prepayment and\r\nproviding for the payment of the Yield Maintenance Premium and other charges specified herein\r\nwere independently negotiated and bargained for, and constitute a specific material part of the\r\nconsideration given by Borrower to Lender for the making of the Loan except as expressly\r\npermitted hereunder.\r\n10.21\tAssignment. The Loan, the Note, the Loan Documents and/or Lender’s rights,\r\ntide, obligations and interests therein may be assigned by Lender and any of its successors and\r\nassigns to any Person at any time in its discretion, in whole or in part, whether by operation of\r\nlaw (pursuant to a merger or other successor in interest) or otherwise. Upon such assignment, all\r\nreferences to Lender in this Agreement and in any Loan Document shall be deemed to refer to\r\nsuch assignee or successor in interest and such assignee or successor in interest shall thereafter\r\nstand in the place of Lender.

Defendants may not unreasonably withhold\r\nconsent for Plaintiffs to lease the property to any potential tenants.\r\n4.\tPlaintiffs must be permitted to use funds in their reserve account held by Defendants\r\nfor Tenant Improvements as required under Section 3.4 of the Loan Agreement.\r\nThe property is a $9,000,000.00 commercial industrial center owned by Plaintiffs MARIAM,\r\nINC., KAM-RON LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY, and 8950 MEMORY PARK I, L.P. and\r\nwhich is subject to a $9,000,000.00 mortgage that is personally guaranteed by KAMRAN\r\nMEHDIZADEH, and MEHRAN MEHDIZADEH. Recently, one of Plaintiffs’ tenants at the\r\nProperty modified its lease with Plaintiffs, paying a $500,000.00 modification fee in order to do so.\r\nPursuant to the terms of Plaintiffs’ mortgage agreement, the $500,000.00 modification fee was\r\nprovided to Defendants to be applied toward Plaintiffs’ monthly mortgage payments.\r\nPlaintiffs are current on their payments. Despite Plaintiffs’ current status. Defendants refuse\r\nto credit Plaintiffs for all payments made, including the $500,000.00 modification fee that was\r\nprovided to Defendants. Instead, Defendants wrongfully seek to foreclose on the property.\r\nPlaintiffs now bring the present motion for injunctive relief precluding the improper\r\nforeclosure on the following grounds:\r\n1.\tInjunctive relief is warranted under CCP §526(a)(2) because Plaintiffs would suffer\r\nirreparable harm should Defendants’ effort to foreclose on the Property proceed. Specifically,\r\nPlaintiffs will lose a unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 commercial property. Further, should\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n____________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY; [PROPOSED! ORDER________________________\r\n \nDefendants not be required to withdraw the Notice of Foreclosure, to permit Plaintiffs to lease the\r\nproperty, and to permit Plaintiffs to utilize their reserve account for tenant improvements, Plaintiffs\r\nwill be deprived of the income from the property necessary to pay the mortgage, again causing\r\nirreparable harm under CCP §526(a)(2).\r\n2.\tInjunctive relief is warranted under CCP §526(a)(3) because permitting the\r\nforeclosure to proceed would render any judgment in this matter ineffectual. Plaintiffs have brought\r\nthe present action in order to establish that Defendants’ foreclosure is unlawful. Once the Property\r\nis sold in a foreclosure, the Property can not simply be returned to Plaintiffs upon the Court’s\r\ndetermination in the present action that the foreclosure was improper. Further, should Defendants\r\nnot be required to withdraw the Notice of Foreclosure, to permit Plaintiffs to lease the property, and\r\nto permit Plaintiffs to utilize their reserve account for tenant improvements, a judgment will similarly\r\nbe ineffectual under CCP §526(a)(3) because Plaintiffs will not have been able to generate income\r\nwith the Property in order make payments on the property necessary to avoid foreclosure during the\r\nlawsuit.\r\n3.\tInjunctive relief is warranted under CCP §526(a)(4) because pecuniary compensation\r\nwill not afford an adequate relief. In the event the foreclosure is permitted to proceed. Plaintiffs will\r\nlose a unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 commercial property and will not be able to be made\r\nwhole through a simple damages award. Similarly, should Defendants not be required to withdraw\r\nthe Notice of Foreclosure, to permit Plaintiffs to lease the property, and to permit Plaintiffs to utilize\r\ntheir reserve account for tenant improvements, pecuniary compensation will be inadequate under\r\nCCP §526(a)(4) because Plaintiffs will not have been able to generate income with the Property in\r\norder make payments on the property necessary to avoid foreclosure during the lawsuit and again\r\nwill lose the unique, irreplaceable property.\r\nA temporary restraining order pending the ruling on the present motion issued on June 3,\r\n2010.\r\n//\r\n//\r\n//\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n_________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY; [PROPOSED] ORDER________________\r\n \nI\r\n \nThis motion will be based on C.C.P. §§ 526(a)(2),(3),(4), the following Memorandum of\r\nPoints and Authorities, exhibits, Declarations of Kamran Mehdizadeh, Alan Levy, and other\r\nevidence to be presented at the hearing on this motion.\r\nDated: June 3, 2010\r\nPAYAB & ASSOCIATES\r\nBy:\r\nDAVID PAYAB, ESQ\r\nLEONARD S.

ORDER________________\r\n \nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES\r\nI.\tSUMMARY OF PLAINTIFFS’ ARGUMENT\r\nIn early 2007, Plaintiffs MARIAM, INC. (“MARIAM”), KAM-RON LIMITED LIABILITY\r\nCOMPANY (“KAM-RON”), 8950 MEMORY PARK I, L.P. (“8950 MEMORY PARK”) refinanced\r\ntheir mortgage loan on their unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 commercial property located at\r\n27772 Avenue Scott, Valencia, California 91355 (“the Property”). The Property was refinanced\r\nsubject to a mortgage loan of approximately $9,000,000.00. In 2009, one of the tenants of the\r\ncommercial property modified its lease at the property, paying a $500,000.00 modification fee. The\r\nfull $500,000.00 modification fee was provided to DEFENDANTS as payment toward Plaintiffs’\r\nmonthly mortgage payments. However, DEFENDANTS refused and continue to refuse to credit the\r\naccount of MARIAM, KAM-RON, and 8950 MEMORY PARK for the amount of the modification\r\nfee even though they are in possession of the funds. Though Plaintiffs’ payment of $500,000.00\r\nclearly renders the mortgage current, Defendants now unlawfully seek to foreclose on the unique\r\n$9,000,000.00 commercial property. Defendants’ unlawful foreclosure must be stopped immediately\r\nvia injunctive relief. Without injunctive relief to stop the improper foreclosure, Defendants will\r\nsuffer irreparable injury through the loss of a unique $9,000,000.00 commercial property in an\r\nimproper foreclosure sale.\r\nPlaintiffs also seek a Court order establishing that (1) Defendants’ Notice of Default dated\r\nMarch 9,2010 is withdrawn; (2) Plaintiffs may lease the Property; defendants may not unreasonably\r\nwithheld consent for Plaintiffs to lease the property to any potential tenants; and (3) Pursuant to\r\nSection 3.4 of the Loan Agreement, Plaintiffs must be permitted to use funds in their reserve account\r\nfor tenant improvements.\r\n//\r\n//\r\n//\r\n//\r\n//\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n_________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY;[PRQPQSED1 ORDER____________________\r\n \nI\r\n \nII.\tARGUMENT\r\nA.\tDEFENDANTS HAVE UNLAWFULLY COMMENCED FORECLOSURE\r\nPROCEEDINGS AGAINST PLAINTIFFS DESPITE THE FACT THAT PLAINTIFFS\r\nARE CURRENT ON THEIR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS\r\n1.\tPLAINTIFFS REFINANCED THE UNIQUE. $9.000.000.00 COMMERCIAL\r\nPROPERTY SUBJECT TO A MORTGAGE OF APPROXIMATELY\r\n$9.000.000.00 AROUND MARCH 2007\r\nAround March 2007, Plaintiffs MARIAM, KAM-RON, and 8950 MEMORY PARK\r\nrefinanced the Property located at 27772 Avenue Scott, Valencia, California 91355 (“the Property”).\r\n(K. Mehdizadeh Decl. ^3.) The Property is a unique commercial property with a value of\r\napproximately $9,000,000.00. Id. The property was purchased subject to a mortgage of\r\napproximately $9,000,000.00 (“the Loan”). Id. The terms of the $9,000,000.00 Loan were reflected\r\nin a written loan agreement (“the Loan Agreement”). (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. ^[3; Exh. A, a true and\r\ncorrect copy of the Loan Agreement.)\r\n2.\tTHE $9.000.000.00 LOAN IS PERSONALLY GUARANTEED BY\r\nPLAINTIFFS KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH AND MEHRAN MEHDIZADEH\r\nPlaintiffs K. MEHDIZADEH and M. MEHDIZADEH personally guaranteed the\r\n$9,000,000.00 Loan. (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. f4; Exh. B, a true and correct copy of the written\r\npersonal guarantee of K. MEHDIZADEH and M.

Tenant Rent Checks Made\r\nOut to Plaintiffs Were Automatically Credited as Mortgage Payments\r\nAfter Being Provided to Defendants\r\nPursuant to Paragraph 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, all rents from all non-residential tenants\r\nat the Property were to be paid directly to the lender. (Exh. A, Page 15, Section 3.1.) At all times\r\nrelevant herein, this provision required that rents from all non-residential tenants be paid directly to\r\nDEFENDANT BANK OF AMERICA. (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. 1(5.)\r\nBecause rent checks were to be provided directly to Defendants, Defendants regularly\r\nprocessed tenant payment checks made payable to Plaintiffs by applying the amount of the checks\r\ntoward Plaintiff’s mortgage. (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. ^6)\r\n3.\tIN 2009. A TENANT PAID A $500.000.00 MODIFICATION FEE TO\r\nMODIFY THE TERMS OF HIS LEASE\r\nIn 2009, a tenant modified its lease at the Property. The tenant paid a $500,000.00\r\nmodification fee (the “Modification Fee”) to PLAINTIFFS in order to lease a smaller portion of the\r\nProperty than it had leased prior to the modification. (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. Tf8.)\r\n4.\tTHE $500.000.00 MODIFICATION FEE WAS PROVIDED TO\r\nDEFENDANTS TO BE APPLIED TOWARD PLAINTIFF’S MORTGAGE\r\nPursuant to Paragraph 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, the Modification Fee was provided to\r\nDEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA\r\nFINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. by Plaintiffs.1 (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. 1f9; Exh. C.) The Modification\r\nFee was provided in four separate payments: $250,000.00, $200,000.00, $40,000.00, and $28,000.00.\r\n‘DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA\r\nFINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. are loan servicing companies for the loan. (K. Mehdizadeh\r\nDecl. f 7.) Payments are made to DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE,\r\nINC. and WACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. to be provided to DEFENDANT BANK\r\nOF AMERICA.

The checks in the amounts of $250,000.00 and $200,000.00\r\nwere made payable from the tenant to PLAINTIFFS and were provided directly to DEFENDANTS\r\nWACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES,\r\nINC., which regularly processed tenant payment checks made payable to PLAINTIFFS by applying\r\nthe amount of the checks toward PLAINTIFFS’ mortgage. (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. 1[9; Exh. C.) All\r\nfour payments were to be applied toward Plaintiffs’ monthly mortgage payments (K. Mehdizadeh\r\nDecl. K9.)\r\nThe backs of both the $250,000.00 and $200.000.00 check confirm that the checks were\r\nprocessed bv DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE. INC, and\r\nWACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES. INC, for payment to DEFENDANT BANK of AMERICA.\r\n(Exh. C.)\r\n5.\tDEFENDANTS HAVE FAILED TO CREDIT PLAINTIFFS WITH HAVING\r\nMADE THE $500.000 PAYMENT\r\nDespite the fact that Plaintiffs have provided the aforementioned $518,000.00 payment -\r\nincluding the $500,000.00 modification fee - to Defendants, Defendants have failed to apply\r\nPlaintiffs’ payments toward the Plaintiffs’ monthly mortgage payments for the Loan. (K.\r\nMehdizadeh Decl. Ifl 1.) 6 *\r\n6.\tTHOUGH THE $500.000.00 MORTGAGE PAYMENT RENDERS\r\nPLAINTIFFS CURRENT ON THE MORTGAGE. DEFENDANTS HAVE\r\nINITIATED FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS\r\nRather than apply Plaintiffs’ $518,000.00 payment toward the Plaintiffs’ monthly mortgage\r\npayments for the Loan, Defendants have commenced foreclosure proceedings. (K. Mehdizadeh\r\nDecl. ^12.) On or about March 9,2010, DEFENDANTS initiated foreclosure proceedings on the\r\nProperty. (Exh.

ORDER___________________\r\n \n7.\tDEFENDANTS’ EMAILS TO PLAINTIFFS CONFIRM THAT PLAINTIFFS\r\nARE CURRENT ON THE MORTGAGE AND THAT DEFENDANTS’\r\nFORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS ARE UNLAWFUL\r\nDefendants have admitted that Plaintiffs’ mortgage payments are current. A May 29, 2009\r\nEmail from Defendants to Alan Levy of PLAINTIFF 8950 MEMORY PARK confirms both that\r\n(1)\tDefendants did receive the $250,000.00 check that was part of the Modification Fee and (2) with\r\nPlaintiffs’ $250.000.00 payment, payments were current on Plaintiffs’ $9,000.000.00 Loan. (Exh.\r\nE, a true and correct copy of Defendants’ May 29, 2009 Email to Alan Levy.)\r\nAs the $250,000.00 payment in the Email rendered the Loan current, there is no dispute that\r\nDefendants’ foreclosure proceedings are unlawful.\r\nThe fact that Defendants failed to properly credit Plaintiffs’ account for any of the\r\n$500,000.00 Modification Fee that was provided to Defendants was confirmed in another Email\r\nfrom Alan Levy. As Levy indicated in his Email, Plaintiffs had emphasized to Defendants that their\r\n$518,000.00 payment rendered the Loan current. (Exh. F, a true and correct copy of the Email from\r\nAlan Levy of8950 MEMORY PARK I, L.P. to Defendants dated March 31,2010.) Defendants had\r\nexplicitly agreed to properly credit Plaintiffs’ account, yet had failed to do so. Id. 8\r\n8.\tDEFENDANTS HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED TO PROVIDE PLAINTIFFS\r\nWITH A FULL AND COMPLETE ACCOUNTING OF ALL PAYMENTS\r\nMADE TOWARD THE LOAN\r\nDespite Plaintiffs’ repeated requests, Defendants have repeatedly failed to provide Plaintiffs\r\nwith a full and complete accounting of all payments made toward the loan. Plaintiff Karman\r\nMehdizadeh, on behalf of all Plaintiffs, has repeatedly contacted Defendants to request a full and\r\ncomplete accounting of all payments made. (K. Mehdizadeh Deck %24.) In an April 1,2010 Email\r\nto Defendants, Alan Levy confirmed both that Plaintiff Kamran Mehdizadeh had repeatedly\r\nrequested an accounting and that Defendants had failed to get back to him. (Exh. G, a true and\r\ncorrect copy of Alan Levy’s Email to Defendants.) In an April 3, 2010 Email, Mr. Levy again\r\nrequested that Defendants provide Plaintiffs with a complete payment history. (Exh. H, a true and\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n__________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY; fPROPOSED] ORDER____________________\r\n \ncorrect copy of Alan Levy’s April 3, 2010 Email to Defendants, Bullet Point No. 2.) Defendants\r\nhave never responded to any of Plaintiffs’ requests for an accounting. (K. Mehdizadeh Decl. 1(24.)\r\nB.\tPLAINTIFFS HAVE BROUGHT THE PRESENT LAWSUIT IN ORDER TO\r\nPREVENT THE UNLAWFUL FORECLOSURE ON THE UNIQUE,\r\nIRREPLACEABLE $9.000.000.00 COMMERCIAL PROPERTY\r\nPlaintiffs have now brought the present lawsuit in order to establish that Defendants’\r\nforeclosure on the unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 commercial property is unlawful and to stop\r\nthe unlawful foreclosure from proceeding.\r\nC.\tSHOULD A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION NOT ISSUE. PLAINTIFFS WILL BE\r\nIRREPARABLY HARMED BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS WILL LOSE THE UNIQUE.\r\nIRREPLACEABLE $9.000.000.00 COMMERCIAL PROPERTY TO\r\nFORECLOSURE PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING THE UNLAWFULNESS OF THE\r\nFORECLOSURE IN THE PRESENT ACTION\r\nInjunctive relief precluding Defendants from proceeding with the foreclosure proceedings\r\non the Property is warranted because in the event that injunctive relief is not granted, Plaintiffs will\r\nlose the unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 Property to foreclosure prior to having the opportunity\r\nto be able to establish the unlawfulness of the foreclosure in the present action. Once the Property\r\nis lost to foreclosure, Plaintiffs will have no avenue to recover the Property, and damages will be\r\nwholly inadequate to compensate Plaintiffs for the loss of this unique Property.\r\nGiven the nature of the unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 property at issue, injunctive relief\r\nis warranted for three reasons:\r\n1.\tInjunctive relief is warranted under CCP §526(a)(2) because Plaintiffs would suffer\r\nirreparable harm should Defendants’ effort to foreclose on the Property proceed. Specifically,\r\nPlaintiffs will lose a unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 commercial property. Further, should\r\nDefendants not be required to withdraw the Notice of Foreclosure, to permit Plaintiffs to lease the\r\nproperty, and to permit Plaintiffs to utilize their reserve account for tenant improvements, Plaintiffs\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n___________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY: fPROPOSED] ORDER_____________________\r\n \nwill be deprived of the income from the property necessary to pay the mortgage, again causing\r\nirreparable harm under CCP §526(a)(2).\r\n2.\tInjunctive relief is warranted under CCP §526(a)(3) because permitting the\r\nforeclosure to proceed would render anyjudgment in this matter ineffectual. Plaintiffs have brought\r\nthe present action in order to establish that Defendants’ foreclosure is unlawful. Once the Property\r\nis sold in a foreclosure, the Property can not simply be returned to Plaintiffs upon the Court’s\r\ndetermination in the present action that the foreclosure was improper. Further, should Defendants\r\nnot be required to withdraw the Notice of Foreclosure, to permit Plaintiffs to lease the property, and\r\nto permit Plaintiffs to utilize their reserve account for tenant improvements, a judgment will similarly\r\nbe ineffectual under CCP §526(a)(3) because Plaintiffs will not have been able to generate income\r\nwith the Property in order make payments on the property necessary to avoid foreclosure during the\r\nlawsuit.\r\n3.\tInjunctive relief is warranted under CCP §526(a)(4) because pecuniary compensation\r\nwill not afford an adequate relief. In the event the foreclosure is permitted to proceed, Plaintiffs will\r\nlose a unique, irreplaceable $9,000,000.00 commercial property and will not be able to be made\r\nwhole through a simple damages award. Similarly, should Defendants not be required to withdraw\r\nthe Notice of Foreclosure, to permit Plaintiffs to lease the property, and to permit Plaintiffs to utilize\r\ntheir reserve account for tenant improvements, pecuniary compensation will be inadequate under\r\nCCP §526(a)(4) because Plaintiffs will not have been able to generate income with the Property in\r\norder make payments on the property necessary to avoid foreclosure during the lawsuit and again\r\nwill lose the unique, irreplaceable property.\r\nD.\tPLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO THEIR ATTORNEYS’ FEES FOR THE\r\nPRESENT MOTION\r\nPursuant to Page 37, Section 5.17 of Loan Agreement (Exh. A) and Page 8, Line 16b or\r\nPersonal Guarantee (Exh. B), Plaintiffs are entitled to their attorneys ’ fees for being required to bring\r\nthe present motion and the present lawsuit as a result of Defendants’ actions. Plaintiffs reserve the\r\nright to move for their attorneys’ fees pursuant to a noticed Motion upon the granting of the present\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n___________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY; [PROPOSED! ORDER_____________________\r\n \nMotion.\r\nE.\tTHE NOTICE OF FORECLOSURE MUST BE WITHDRAWN IMMEDIATELY\r\nIn addition to halting the possible foreclosure on the Property, the Notice of Foreclosure must\r\nbe withdrawn immediately. (Exh. D.) With the pending foreclosure, potential tenants are reluctant\r\nto rent the available space at the Property. (Mehdizadeh Decl. ^20.) As a result, Plaintiffs have been\r\ndeprived of and will continue to be deprived of hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent revenue\r\nnecessary to pay the mortgage at the Premises. Id.\r\nIn addition. Plaintiffs are professional real estate investors. The impending foreclosure on\r\nPlaintiffs’ credit report has harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiffs’ opportunities to obtain\r\ncredit in order to qualify for other potential real estate investments. (Mehdizadeh Decl. f21.) The\r\nNotice of Foreclosure must be withdrawn in order to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs both due\r\nto lost revenue at the property and due to lost opportunities to engage in other real estate investments.\r\nId.\r\nF.\tPLAINTIFFS MUST BE PERMITTED TO LEASE THE PROPERTY\r\nDefendants must be precluded from unreasonably withholding their consent to allow\r\nPlaintiffs to lease the property to any particular tenant. Should Plaintiffs not be permitted to lease\r\nthe Property, Plaintiffs will be deprived of the revenue necessary to pay the Loan and will be forced\r\ninto another foreclosure, again suffering irreparable harm due to the loss of the unique $9,000,000.00\r\ncommercial property.\r\nG.\tPLAINTIFFS MUST BE PERMITTED TO UTILIZE THEIR RESERVE ACCOUNT\r\nFOR REPAIRS TO THE PROPERTY\r\nPlaintiffs have been in a dialogue with a potential tenant who requires capital improvements\r\nto the Property in order to agree to lease the Property. (Mehdizadeh Decl. ^|22.) The potential\r\ntenant is a cosmetic manufacturing company interested in renting 60,000 square feet of the property,\r\nincluding $8,000.00 square feet of offices. Id. Some capital improvements are necessary because\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n__________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY;fPROPOSEDl ORDER______________________\r\n \nthe previous tenant had occupied the same portion of the premises for over 20 years without\r\nrenovations. Id.\r\nPursuant to Section 3.4 ofthe Loan Agreement, Plaintiffs are permitted to utilize their reserve\r\naccount to make the requested capital improvements to the Property. (Exh. A, Page 17, Section 3.4)\r\nPlaintiffs must be permitted to make capital improvements to the premises as are requested by this\r\npotential tenant or any other potential tenant. As of May 31,2010, the balance of the reserve account\r\nshould be $401,400.00. (Mehdizadeh Deck f23.) Under Section 3.4, Plaintiffs should be able to\r\napply these funds toward capital repairs so that Plaintiffs will not be deprived of the revenue from\r\nany potential tenants.\r\nShould Plaintiffs not be able to utilize their reserves for capital repairs, Plaintiffs will be\r\nunable to lease the property and will be deprived of the revenue necessary to pay the Loan. Plaintiffs\r\nwill then be forced into another foreclosure, again suffering irreparable harm due to the loss of the\r\nunique $9,000,000.00 commercial property.\r\nIII.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court grant Plaintiffs’\r\nMotion for a Preliminary Injunction.\r\nDated: June _5,2010\tPAYAB & ASSOCIATES\r\nBy:\r\nDAVID PAYAB, ESQ.\r\nLEONARD S. KIRSCHEN, ESQ.\r\nAttorneys for Plaintiffs MARIAM, INC.,\r\nKAM-RON LIMITED LIABILITY\r\nCOMPANY, 8950 MEMORY PARK I, L.P.,\r\nKAMRAN MEHDIZADEH, and MEHRAN\r\nMEHDIZADEH\r\nPLAINTIFFS’ NOTICE OF MOTION AND MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION;\r\nMEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES; DECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH;\r\n________________DECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY; [PROPOSED! ORDER______________\r\n \nDECLARATION OF KAMRAN MEHDIZADEH\r\nI,\tKamran Mehdizadeh, declare and state as follows:\r\n1.\tIam the President and sole officer of MARIAM, INC. I am a member of KAM-RON\r\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. I am over the age of eighteen. If called to testify, I could and\r\nwould competently testify to all of the facts and circumstances set forth below on the basis of my\r\nown personal knowledge.\r\n2.\tI make this Declaration in support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction.\r\n3.\tAround March 2007, Plaintiffs MARIAM, INC. (hereafter “MARIAM”) KAM-RON\r\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (hereafter “KAM-RON”), and 8950 MEMORY PARK I, L.P.\r\n(Hereafter “8950 MEMORY PARK”) refinanced the Property that located at 27772 Avenue Scott,\r\nValencia, California 91355 (“the Property”). The Property is a unique commercial property with a\r\nvalue of approximately $9,000,000.00. The property was refinanced subject to a mortgage of\r\napproximately $9,000,000.00 (“the Loan”). The terms of the $9,000,000.00 Loan were reflected in\r\na written loan agreement (“the Loan Agreement”). Attached as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy\r\nof the Loan Agreement.\r\n4.\tBoth Mehran Mehdizadeh and I personally guaranteed the $9,000,000.00 Loan.\r\nAttached as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of the written personal guarantee signed by me and\r\nMehran Mehdizadeh. Mehran Mehdizadeh and I are brothers. My brother and I have engaged in\r\nnumerous business transactions together. I have seen him sign hundreds of documents. I am\r\nsufficiently familiar with his signature to confirm that his signature is present on Exhibit B.\r\n5.\tPursuant to Paragraph 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, all rents from all non-residential\r\ntenants at the Property were to be paid directly to the lender. (Exh. A, Page 15, Section 3.1.) At all\r\ntimes relevant herein, this provision required that rents from all non-residential tenants be paid\r\ndirectly to DEFENDANT BANK OF AMERICA.\r\n6.\tBecause rent checks were to be provided directly to Defendants to be applied to the\r\nLoan, Defendants regularly processed tenant payment checks made payable to Plaintiffs by applying\r\nthe amount of the checks toward Plaintiffs mortgage.\r\n7.\tDEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and\r\nWACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. are loan servicing companies for the loan. Payments\r\n \nare made to DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA\r\nFINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. to be provided to DEFENDANT BANK OF AMERICA.\r\n8.\tIn 2009, a tenant modified its lease at the Property. The tenant paid a $500,000.00\r\nmodification fee (the “Modification Fee”) to PLAINTIFFS in order to lease a smaller portion of the\r\nProperty than it had leased prior to the modification.\r\n9.\tPursuant to Paragraph 3.1 of the Loan Agreement, the Modification Fee was provided\r\nto DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA\r\nFINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. by Plaintiffs. (Exh. C.) The Modification Fee was provided in four\r\nseparate payments: $250,000.00, $200,000.00, $40,000.00, and $28,000.00. The final two payments\r\nwere provided directly from PLAINTIFFS made payable to “Wachovia.” Attached as Exhibit C are\r\ntrue and correct copies of the four checks by which Defendants were provided with Modification\r\nFee. The checks in the amounts of $250,000.00 and $200,000.00 were made payable from the tenant\r\nto PLAINTIFFS and were provided directly to DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL\r\nMORTGAGE, INC. and WACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC., which regularly processed\r\ntenant payment checks made payable to PLAINTIFFS by applying the amount of the checks toward\r\nPLAINTIFFS ’ mortgage. (Exh. C.) All four payments were to be applied toward Plaintiffs’ monthly\r\nmortgage payments.\r\n10.\tThe backs of both the $250.000.00 and $200.000.00 check confirm that the checks\r\nwere processed bv DEFENDANTS WACHOVIA COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE. INC, and\r\nWACHOVIA FINANCIAL SERVICES. INC, for payment to DEFENDANT BANK of AMERICA.\r\n(Exh. C.)\r\n11.\tDespite the fact that Plaintiffs have provided the aforementioned $518,000.00\r\npayment - including the $500,000.00 modification fee - to Defendants, Defendants have failed to\r\napply Plaintiffs’ payments toward Plaintiffs’ monthly mortgage payments for the Loan.\r\n12.\tRather than apply Plaintiffs’ $518,000.00 payment toward Plaintiffs’ monthly\r\nmortgage payments for the Loan, Defendants have commenced foreclosure proceedings. On or about\r\nMarch 9, 2010, DEFENDANTS initiated foreclosure proceedings on the Property. Attached as\r\nExhibit D is a true and correct copy of Defendants’ Notice of Foreclosure.\r\n13.\tI am the custodian of records for all documents relating to Plaintiffs’ ownership of\r\nthe Property. I have custody of the books and records of Plaintiffs pertaining to the Property.\r\n \nI\r\n \n14.\tThe records and other documents in the files of Plaintiff, including the documents\r\nsubmitted in conjunction with this Memorandum and/or attached to my declaration, constitute\r\nwritings made and kept in the ordinary and regular course of the business of Plaintiff, at or near the\r\ntime of the event, act, or occurrence, of which they are a record.\r\n15.\tI further state from my own knowledge that each such record or document was\r\nprepared by persons employed by Plaintiff who have personal knowledge of the events being\r\nrecorded and who had a duty in the course and scope of their employment to accurately record the\r\nevent and/or are documents received as prepared from third parties, and as received are kept in the\r\nordinary and regular course of business of Plaintiff.\r\n16.\tAttached hereto as Exhibits \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C,” and “D” as described above and Exhibits\r\n“E,” “F,” “G,” and “H” as described below are true and correct copies of original documents which\r\nare maintained as a regular business practice by Plaintiffs.\r\n17.\tA May 29,2009 Email from Defendants to Alan Levy of 8950 MEMORY PARK I,\r\nL.P. confirms both that (1) Defendants did receive the $250,000.00 check that was part of the\r\nModification Fee and (2) with Plaintiffs’ $250.000.00 payment, payments were current on Plaintiffs’\r\n$9.000.000.00 Loan. Attached as Exhibit E is a true and correct copy of Defendants’ May 29,2009\r\nEmail to Alan Levy.\r\n18.\tAs the $250,000.00 payment referenced in the Email rendered the Loan current, there\r\nis no dispute that Defendants’ foreclosure proceedings are unlawful.\r\n19.\tAlan Levy also confirmed the fact that Defendants failed to properly credit Plaintiffs’\r\naccount for any of the $500,000.00 Modification Fee that was provided to Defendants by Plaintiffs\r\nin another Email. Attached as Exhibit F is a true and correct copy of the Email from Alan Levy on\r\nbehalf of 8950 MEMORY PARK I, L.P. to Defendants dated March 31, 2010. As Alan Levy\r\nemphasized in the Email, Plaintiffs had emphasized to Defendants that their $518,000.00 payment\r\nrendered the Loan current. Defendants had explicitly agreed to properly credit Plaintiffs’ account,\r\nyet had failed to do so.\r\n20.\tPlaintiffs are forced to disclose the pending foreclosure to potential tenants at the\r\nProperty. The pending foreclosure renders potential tenants extremely reluctant to rent the available\r\nspace at the Property. As a result, Plaintiffs have been deprived of and will continue to be deprived\r\nof hundreds of thousands of dollars in rent revenue necessary to pay the mortgage at the Premises.\r\n \n21.\tPlaintiffs are professional real estate investors. The impending foreclosure on\r\nPlaintiffs’ credit report has harmed and will continue to harm Plaintiffs’ opportunities to obtain\r\ncredit in order to qualify for other potential real estate investments.\r\n22.\tPlaintiffs have been in a dialogue with a potential tenant who requires capital\r\nimprovements to the Property in order to agree to lease the Property. The potential tenant is a\r\ncosmetic manufacturing company interested in renting 60,000 square feet of the property, including\r\n$8,000.00 square feet of offices. Some capital improvements are necessary because the previous\r\ntenant had occupied the same portion of the premises for over 20 years without renovations.\r\n23.\tPlaintiffs must be permitted to make capital improvements to the premises as are\r\nrequested by the cosmetic manufacturing company or any other potential tenant. As of May 31,\r\n2010, the balance of the reserve account should be $401,000.00.\r\n24.\tDespite Plaintiffs’ repeated requests, Defendants have repeatedly failed to provide\r\nPlaintiffs with a full and complete accounting of all payments made toward the loan. I, personally,\r\nhave repeatedly contacted Defendants to request a full and complete accounting of all payments\r\nmade. In an April 1, 2010 Email to Defendants, Alan Levy confirmed both that I had repeatedly\r\nrequested an accounting and that Defendants had failed to get back to me. Attached as Exhibit G\r\nis a true and correct copy of Alan Levy’s April 1, 2010 Email to Defendants. In an April 3, 2010\r\nEmail, Mr. Levy again requested that Defendants provide Plaintiffs with a complete payment history.\r\nAttached as Exhibit H is a true and correct copy of Alan Levy’s April 3,2010 Email to Defendants,\r\nBullet Point No. 2. Defendants have never responded to any of Plaintiffs’ requests for an\r\naccounting.\r\nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing\r\nis true and correct and that this declaration was\r\n&V /// ^3Cali fomia.\r\nexecuted on this 3rd of June, 2010 at\r\n \n*\r\nI\r\n(\r\nf\r\n<\r\nK\r\n \nc\r\nDECLARATION OF ALAN LEVY\r\n1,\tAlan Levy, declare and state as follows:\r\n1.\tI am a partner of 8950 MEMORY PARK l, L.P.

Borrower hereby expressly waives the\r\nright to receive any notice from Lender with respect to any matter for which no Loan Document\r\nspecifically and expressly requires the giving of notice by Lender to Borrower.\r\n10.13\tRemedies of Borrower. If a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or any of\r\nits agents, including Servicer, has acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case\r\nwhere by law or under any Loan Document, Lender or any such agent, as the case may be, has an\r\nobligation to act reasonably or promptly.

Borrower specifically waives any claim against Lender and its\r\nagents, including Servicer, with respect to actions taken by Lender or its agents on Borrower’s\r\nbehalf.\r\n \n£0.14 Prior Agreements. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the\r\nentire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions contemplated\r\nhereby and thereby, and all prior agreements, understandings and negotiations among or between\r\nsuch parties, whether oral or written, are superseded by the terms of this Agreement and the other\r\nLoan Documents.\r\n10.15\tOffsets.

Lender shall have\r\nthe right to issue any of the foregoing without Borrower’s approval.\r\n10.17\tNo Usury. Borrower and Lender intend at all times to comply with applicable\r\nstate law or applicable United States federal law (to the extent that it permits Lender to contract\r\nfor, charge; take, reserve or receive a greater amount of interest than under state law) and that\r\nthis Section 10.17 shall control every other agreement in die Loan Documents. If die applicable\r\nlaw (state or federal) is ever judicially interpreted so as to render usurious any amount called for\r\nunder the Note or any other Loan Document, or contracted for, charged, taken, reserved or\r\nreceived with respect to the Debt, or if Lender’s exercise of the option to accelerate the maturity\r\nof the Loan or any prepayment by Borrower results in Borrower having paid any interest in\r\nexcess of that permitted by applicable law, then it is Borrower’s and Lender’s express intent that\r\nall excess amounts theretofore collected by Lender shall be credited against the unpaid Principal\r\nand all other Debt (or, if the Debt has been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded to\r\nBorrower), and the provisions of the Loan Documents immediately be deemed reformed and the\r\namounts thereafter collectible thereunder reduced, without die necessity of the execution of any\r\nnew document, so as to comply with applicable law, but so as to permit the recovery of the\r\nfullest amount otherwise called for thereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to Lender for\r\nthe use, forbearance or detention of the Loan shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be\r\namortized, prorated, allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until\r\npayment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of die Debt does not exceed the\r\nmaximum lawful rate from time to time in effect and applicable to the Debt for so long as the\r\nDebt is outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any Loan Document,\r\nit is not the intention of Lender to accelerate the maturity of any interest that has not accrued at\r\nthe time of such acceleration or to collect unearned interest at the time of such acceleration.\r\n \n(\r\n10.18\tConflict; Construction of Documents. In the event of any conflict between the\r\nprovisions of this Agreement and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this\r\nAgreement shall control. The parties hereto acknowledge that each is represented by separate\r\ncounsel in connection with the negotiation and drafting of the Loan Documents and that the Loan\r\nDocuments shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning against the party that\r\ndrafted them.\r\n10.19\tNo Third Party Beneficiaries. The Loan Documents are solely for the benefit of\r\nLender and Borrower and nothing contained in any Loan Document shall be deemed to confer\r\nupon anyone other than the Lender and Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the\r\nperformance or observance of any of the obligations contained therein.\r\n1020 Yield Maintenance Premium. Borrower acknowledges that (a) Lender is\r\nmaking the Loan in consideration of the receipt by Lender of all interest and other benefits\r\nintended to be conferred by the Loan Documents that is not prepayable prior to the Stated\r\nMaturity Date and (b) if payments of Principal are made to Lender prior to the regularly\r\nscheduled due date for such payment, for any reason whatsoever, including as a result of\r\nLender’s acceleration of the Loan after an Event of Default, by operation of law or otherwise.\r\nLender will not receive all such interest and other benefits and may, in addition, incur costs. For\r\nthese reasons, and to induce Lender to make the Loan, Borrower expressly waives any right or\r\nprivilege to prepay the Loan except as otherwise may be specifically permitted herein and agrees\r\nthat, except as expressly provided in Sections 2.3.4 and 7.4.2, all prepayments, if any, will be\r\naccompanied by the Yield Maintenance Premium. Such Yield Maintenance Premium shall be\r\nrequired whether payment is made by Borrower, by a Person on behalf of Borrower, or by the\r\npurchaser at any foreclosure sale, and may be included in any bid by Lender at such sale.\r\nBorrower further acknowledges that (A) it is a knowledgeable real estate developer and/or\r\ninvestor; (B) it fully understands die effect of the provisions of this Section 1020, as well as die\r\nother provisions of the Loan Documents; (Q the making of the Loan by Lender at die Interest\r\nRate and other terms set forth in the Loan Documents are sufficient consideration for Borrower’s\r\nobligation to pay a Yield Maintenance Premium (if required); and (D) Lender would not make\r\nthe Loan on the terms set forth herein without die inclusion of such provisions. Borrower also\r\nacknowledges that the provisions of this Agreement limiting the right of prepayment and\r\nproviding for the payment of the Yield Maintenance Premium and other charges specified herein\r\nwere independently negotiated and bargained for, and constitute a specific material part of die\r\nconsideration given by Borrower to Lender for the making of the Loan except as expressly\r\npermitted hereunder.\r\n10.21\tAssignment. The Loan, the Note, the Loan Documents and/or Lender’s rights,\r\ntitle, obligations and interests therein may be assigned by Lender and any of its successors and\r\nassigns to any Person at any time in its discretion, in whole or in part, whether by operation of\r\nlaw (pursuant to a merger or other successor in interest) or otherwise. Upon such assignment, all\r\nreferences to Lender in this Agreement and in any Loan Document shall be deemed to refer to\r\nsuch assignee or successor in interest and such assignee or successor in interest shall thereafter\r\nstand in the place of Lender. Borrower may not assign its rights, tide, interests or obligations\r\nunder this Agreement or under any of the Loan Documents.\r\n \n10.22\tCounterparts.

F-47\r\nDate: 1/28/15\r\nCase #PC048384\r\nMOTION FOR ATTORNEYS’ FEES\r\nMOVING PARTY: Ds CW Capital Asset Management LLC; CW Financial Services LLC; and\r\nWells Fargo, N.A.\r\nRESPONDING PARTY: Ps Mariam, Inc.; Kam-Ron Limited Liability Company; 8950 Memory\r\nPark I, L.P.; Kamran Mehdizadeh; and Mehran Mehdizadeh\r\nRELIEF REQUESTED: An order awarding MPs attys fees incurred in this matter in the amount\r\nof$488,883.90.\r\nSUMMARY OF ACTION: This action arises out of foreclosure proceedings against RPs’\r\nproperty.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY: On 8/22/14, MPs’ demurrer to the operative 4th Amended\r\nComplaint (4AC) was sustained w/o leave. On 9/11/4, the court entered an order and judgment\r\nof dismissal in favor of MPs.\r\nRULING: The request for an award of attys’ fees is granted. However, the court finds the\r\namount of fees requested to be excessive. Therefore, the amount of fees awarded to MPs is\r\nreduced accordingly.\r\nThere is no dispute that MPs are the prevailing parties in this action. Therefore, MPs are entitled\r\nto recover their costs, including reasonable attys’ fees, if such fees are included as an item of\r\ncosts under a contract, statute or other law. See CCP 1032(a)(4), (b); CCP 1033.5(a)(10).\r\nSection 5.17 of the Loan Agreement is a valid and enforceable attys’ fee provision as it obligates\r\nthe borrower to pay all reasonable attys’ fees incurred by the lender in connection w/ the loan.\r\n(See 4AC, Ex.A §5.17). RPs have repeatedly asserted in their various verified complaints in this\r\naction that they are entitled to recover their attys’ fees and costs in this action due to Ds’ breach\r\nof written contract/loan agreement. (See Compl. |50; FAC ]f55; SAC |57; TAC ]f57; 4AC ^J58).\r\nThese admissions preclude RPs from taking the contrary position that §5.17 is not an attys’ fee\r\nprovision.\r\nThe provision at issue is also broad enough to cover both the contract and tort claims alleged\r\nagainst MPs in this action as the provision covers fees incurred “in connection w/ the Loan” and\r\nin “the prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or other litigation.” (4AC, Ex. A\r\n§5.17). Even though MPs are not signatories to the subject loan agreement, they are entitled to\r\nrecover attys’ fees pursuant to reciprocity provisions of CC 1717. See CC 1717(a); Reynolds\r\nMetals Co. (1979) 25 C3d 124, 128. RPs have asserted contract based claims against MPs\r\nthroughout this litigation, including the 4AC which contained a C/A for declaratory relief. Such\r\nclaims provide a contractual basis for an award of attys’ fees under CC 1717. See Las Palmas\r\nAssociates (1991) 235 CA3d 1220, 1259.\r\nThe Mehdizadehs are liable for attys’ fees under the loan agreement and guaranty as they sought\r\nrecovery of such fees against MPs in the original complaint, FAC, and SAC. CC 1717.\r\nAdditionally, the guaranty signed by the Mehdizadehs may be deemed part of the loan\r\nagreement. See Ganey (1987) 191 CA3d901.\r\nMPs are entitled to recover fees related to both the contract and tort claims b/c the claims were so\r\ninextricably intertwined that it would be impracticable to apportion the fees among the different\r\nclaims. See Maxim Crane Works. L.P. (2012) 208 CA4th 286, 298; Abdallah (1996) 43 CA4th\r\n1101, 1111.\r\nMPs are entitled to recover their attys’ fees as the prevailing parties, the amount sought is not\r\nreasonable.

(hereinafter, “Plaintiff’) is moving to compel the further responses\r\nof Defendant Bank of America, N.A.

First, prior to Defendants’\r\nimproper attempt to foreclose on the property, the parties discussed the possibility of a loan\r\nmodification agreement. Plaintiffs reasonableness in accepting a loan modification agreement\r\nrelates directly to Plaintiffs attempt to mitigate damages. The amount of any appraisals relates\r\ndirectly to Plaintiffs reasonableness in accepting any loan modification proposal offered by\r\nDefendant and therefore similarly relates to Plaintiff s reasonableness in attempting to mitigate\r\ndamages.\r\nAppraisals also relate directly to Defendant’s motive for attempting to foreclose on the\r\n3roperty.

From the reply, it\r\nseems that Ds accept Ps’ explanation that the reference to Alan Levy as a “P” was a\r\nclerical error. However, the opposition fails to explain how alleged misrepresentations\r\nmade to Levy, who is a general partner of 8950 Memory Park I, L.P., which is only 1 of\r\nthe Ps bringing the fraud C/A, supports the claim as to the other Ps. Additionally, the\r\nFAC fails to allege facts to show how all of the Ds (ie, CW Capital Asset Management\r\nand CW Financial) named in the C/A are liable for the purported misrepresentations\r\nmade by David Holman.\r\nThe 3rd C/A for Negligent Misrepresentation relies on the same factual allegations as the\r\nfraud C/A and. therefore, fails for the same reasons.\r\nPs have failed to allege sufficient facts to state the 4th C/A for Defamation. The FAC\r\nfails to allege sufficient facts to support a finding of malice which is necessary to\r\novercome the privilege provided in CC 2924(d) for the statements set forth in the Notice\r\nof Default. The only reference to malicious conduct in the 4th C/A is the conclusory\r\nallegation in relation to the punitive damage allegation. (FAC ^{103).\r\nThe individual Ps have failed to allege sufficient facts to support the 5th C/A for IIED.\r\nThe IIED claim is based on foreclosure proceedings on property which Kamran and\r\nMehran Mehdizadeh had personally guaranteed the loan and purported false statements\r\nmade to the foregoing Ps credit reports. Based on the facts alleged, the conduct does not\r\nseem sufficiently extreme and outrageous to support a claim for IIED. Further, no facts\r\nare alleged to support the conclusory allegations that Ps suffered severe and extreme\r\nemotional distress for prolonged periods of time. (FAC c^107, 109).\r\nThe individual Ps have also failed to allege sufficient facts to support the 6th C/A for\r\nNIED. Insufficient facts are alleged to show that the Ds owed these Ps any independent\r\nduty to provide them w/ truthful info regarding the application of the lease modification\r\nfee.. Additionally, the FAC fails to allege facts to show that any false info was provided\r\nto these Ps by Ds.\r\nW/ regard to the 7th C/A for an Accounting, it appears that such relief is warranted in this\r\ncase to determine how the lease modification fee was applied to the different accounts,\r\netc. However, it is not clear why each of the Ps is entitled to an accounting from each of\r\nthe Ds. It would seem that such a claim would be b/t the borrower Ps and the Noteholder\r\nD.\r\nThe 8Ul C/A for Dec Relief seeks certain relief which is already covered by other C/As\r\n(ie5 compensate Ps for damages, provide Ps w/ an accounting). However, other relief\r\nrequested (ie, declaration that Ds cease foreclosure proceedings, Ps are current on the\r\nloan) is not necessarily the subject of the other C/As in the FAC. Ps should clarify the\r\nindependent relief sought by way of this C/A.\r\n2","title":"20120708_-_Tentative_Ruling_to_Demurrer_to_FAC.txt","id":"37"},{"snippet":"﻿MC-050\r\nATTORNEY OR PARTY WtTHOUT ATTORNEY (Nan* Sttto 00-number.

With respect to the Mehdizadehs, P’s opposition\r\nmakes no argument regarding how they have standing to sue. A party seeking to enforce a\r\ncontract as a third party beneficiary must plead a contract that was made expressly for his or her\r\nbenefit, and one in which it clearly appears that he or she is the beneficiary. Schauer v.\r\nMandarin Gems of Cal., Inc. (2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 949, 955; see also Rodriguez v. Oto\r\n(2013) 212 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1028. P’s have not alleged sufficient facts to show that\r\nMehdizadehs may sue as third party beneficiaries.\r\nWith regards to whether CW Capital, CW Financial, and Wells Fargo can be held liable,\r\nthere is no dispute that they acted as the noteholder’s agents as permitted under the loan\r\nagreement. However, the mere fact that the loan agreement provided for the noteholder to retain\r\nagents does not mean that they would be liable for breach of contract. When there is a disclosed\r\nprincipal, and there is no dispute that a party was an agent for the principal, the agent cannot be\r\nheld liable for the principal’s breach of contract. Ronav Family Limited Partnership v. Tweed\r\n(2013) 216 Cal. App. 4th 830, 838: Filippo Industries. Inc, v. Sun Ins, Co. (1999) 74 Cal.App.4th\r\n1429. 1442-1443.\r\n2nd CoA- Fraud: SUSTAIN\r\nP’s must allege that D’s intended to defraud them when they made the alleged\r\nmisrepresentations. w[T]he essence of the fraud is the existence of an intent at the time oj the\r\npromise not to perform it.” (Benson v. Hamilton (1932) 126 Cal. App. 331,334 [14 P.2d 876].)\r\n\"To maintain an action for deceit based on a false promise, one must specifically allege and\r\nprove, among other things, that the promisor did not intend to perform at the time he or she made\r\nthe promise and that it was intended to deceive or induce the promisee to do or not do a\r\nparticular thing.” Building Permit Consultants. Inc, v. Mazur (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1400.\r\n1414. P has failed to allege facts showing that D’s agent did not intend to perform at the time he\r\ntold P's that the modification fee would go toward the loan balance. The SAC even suggest the\r\ncontrary, as it alleges that D’s agent was told several weeks later to reverse the credits, implying\r\nthat the agent did not have the requisite intent.\r\nP’s claim that D’s failed to make payments to their account fails because it does not show\r\nan intent to deceive.\r\n3rd CoA- Negligent Misrepresentation: SUSTAIN\r\n \nNegligent misrepresentation differs from fraud in that it does not require an intent to\r\ndefraud , only that D had no reasonable grounds for believing the misrepresentation to be true.\r\nJolley v. Chase Home Finance. LLC (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 872. 892; West v. JPMorgan\r\nChase Bank. N.A. (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 780. 792. Here, the alleged misrepresentation stems\r\nfrom D's agent's purported assurances to P's that the modification fee would be applied to the\r\nmortgage, and the subsequent failure to do so. The factual basis for this claim is based on\r\nallegedly false promise without intent to perform, which is factually defective. Tarmann v. State\r\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 153, 159.\r\n4th CoA- Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress: SUSTAIN\r\nA cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress requires a showing of\r\nextreme and outrageous conduct, or conduct that exceeds all bounds of what is usually tolerated\r\nin civilized society. Hughes v. Pair (2009) 46 Cal.4lh 1035. 1050-1051. it also requires a\r\nshowing of severe emotional distress, which is a high bar such that no reasonable person in\r\ncivilized society should be expected to endure it. Ibid. The SAC does not allege actions\r\nsufficient to constitute extreme and outrageous conduct, nor does it allege facts that show severe\r\nemotional distress.\r\n5lh CoA- Negligent Infliction of Kmotional Distress: SUSTAIN w/o leave to amend. P's make\r\nno argument regarding the demurrer to the 5lh cause of action.\r\n6th CoA- Accounting: SUST AIN w/ regards to all D's except the noteholder Bank of America.\r\nAn accounting is appropriate where there is a fiduciary relationship or any other special\r\nrelationship that would give rise to an accounting remedy, or a specification of amounts due so\r\ncomplicated that it cannot be determined in a legal action for damages. Jolley v. Chase Home\r\nFinance. LLC. supra. 213 Cal.App.4th at p.910. There is no such showing here. However, D's\r\nconcedes that the SAC may support a claim for an accounting by the borrowers against the\r\nnoteholder.\r\n2","title":"20130807_-_Tentative_Ruling_on_Demurrer_to_SAC.txt","id":"39"},{"snippet":"﻿Case #PC0483 84\r\nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\r\nMOVING PARTY: Ps Mariam, Inc., et al.\r\nRESPONDING PARTY: Ds Bank of America, N.A., et al.\r\nThe tentative on the request for Preliminary Injunction is to continue for the following\r\nreasons:\r\nAlthough the conflicting evidence submitted by the parties w/ regard to the correct\r\namount owed by Ps under the loan, it seems that the preliminary injunction should be\r\ngranted; however, the accounting issues are too complex for the court to definitively\r\ndetermine at this point. As such, it can be said that Ps have met their burden of\r\nestablishing a likelihood of success on the merits. Additionally, if the relief is not\r\ngranted and Ps ultimately succeed, they will have suffered irreparable injury due to the\r\nloss of the unique property and the possibility that the individual Ps will be subjected a\r\ndebt which could reach millions of dollars.\r\nIndeed, Ps submitted evidence w/ the reply which should have been included in the\r\nmoving papers and Ds have objected to this evidence on such ground. Therefore, the\r\nhearing is continued so that Ds can properly address this new evidence. Given the fact\r\nthat this hearing was originally scheduled for 7/8/11 and has been continued several\r\ntimes, another brief continuance will not unduly prejudice the parties.\r\nEvidentiary Objections:\r\nA ruling on Ps’ evidentiary objections is delayed until a ruling on the merits of the\r\nmotion.
